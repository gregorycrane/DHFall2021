In a nation so divided as the English, it could scarcely be expected that e death of one sovereign, and the accession of another, who was y believed to have embraced opposite principles to those which d, could be the object of universal satisfaction: yet so much were n displeased with the present conduct of affairs, and such apprehensions e entertained of futurity, that the people, overlooking their l disputes, expressed a general and unfeigned joy that the e had passed into the hand of Elizabeth. That princess had d great prudence in her conduct during the reign of her sister; d as men were sensible of the imminent danger to which she was every t exposed, compassion towards her situation, and concern for her y, had rendered her, to an uncommon degree, the favorite of the n. A parliament had been assembled a few days before Mary’s death; d when Heathe, archbishop of York, then chancellor, notified to them t event, scarcely an interval of regret appeared; and the two houses y resounded with the joyful acclamations of “God save Queen Elizabeth: long and happily may she reign.” The people, less actuated by n, and less influenced by private views, expressed a joy still more l and hearty on her proclamation; and the auspicious commencement of s reign prognosticated that felicity and glory which, during its whole e, so uniformly attended it.[*]



Elizabeth was at Hatfield when she heard of her sister’s death; and after a few days she went thence to London, through crowds of people, who strove h each other in giving her the strongest testimony of their affection.

On her entrance into the Tower, she could not forbear reflecting on the t difference between her present fortune and that which a few years e had attended her, when she was conducted to that place as a r, and lay there exposed to all the bigoted malignity of her s. She fell on her knees, and expressed her thanks to Heaven for the e which the Almighty had granted her from her bloody s; a deliverance, she said, no less miraculous than that which Daniel had received from the den of lions. This act of pious gratitude s to have been the last circumstance in which she remembered any past s and injuries. With a prudence and magnanimity truly laudable, e buried all offences in oblivion, and received with affability even e who had acted with the greatest malevolence against her. Sir Henry Benningfield himself, to whose custody she had been committed, and who had d her with severity, never felt, during the whole course of her n, any effects of her resentment.[**] Yet was not the gracious n which she gave, prostitute and undistinguishing. When the s came in a body to make their obeisance to her, she expressed to l of them sentiments of regard; except to Bonner, from whom she turned e, as from a man polluted with blood, who was a just object of horror o every heart susceptible of humanity.[***]



After employing a few days in ordering her domestic affairs, Elizabeth d to foreign courts her sister’s death, and her own accession. She t Lord Cobham to the Low Countries, where Philip then resided; and she k care to express to that monarch her gratitude for the protection h he had afforded her, and her desire of persevering in that p which had so happily commenced between them. Philip, who had g foreseen this event, and who still hoped, by means of Elizabeth, to n that dominion over England, of which he had failed in espousing Mary, immediately despatched orders to the duke of Feria, his ambassador t London, to make proposals of marriage to the queen; and he offered to e from Rome a dispensation for that purpose. But Elizabeth soon came o the resolution of declining the proposal. She saw that the nation had d an extreme aversion to the Spanish alliance during her r’s reign; and that one great cause of the popularity which she f enjoyed, was the prospect of being freed by her means from the r of foreign subjection. She was sensible that her affinity with Philip was exactly similar to that of her father with Catharine of Arragon; and that her marrying that monarch was, in effect, declaring f illegitimate, and incapable of succeeding to the throne. And h the power of the Spanish monarchy might still be sufficient, in n to all pretenders, to support her title, her masculine spirit d such precarious dominion, which, as it would depend solely on e power of another, must be exercised according to his inclinations.[*]

But while these views prevented her from entertaining any thoughts of a e with Philip, she gave him an obliging, though evasive answer; and e still retained such hopes of success, that he sent a messenger to Rome, h orders to solicit the dispensation.



The queen too, on her sister’s death, had written to Sir Edward Carne, the English ambassador at Rome, to notify her accession to the pope; but the e nature of Paul broke through all the cautious measures d by this young princess. He told Carne, that England was a fief f the holy see; and it was great temerity in Elizabeth to have assumed, t his participation, the title and authority of queen: that being e, she could not possibly inherit that kingdom; nor could he l the sentence, pronounced by Clement VII. and Paul III., with regard o Henry’s marriage: that were he to proceed with rigor, he should punish s criminal invasion of his rights, by rejecting all her applications t being willing to treat her with paternal indulgence, he would still p the door of grace open to her, and that if she would renounce all s to the crown, and submit entirely to his will, she should e the utmost lenity compatible with the dignity of the apostolic e.[*] When this answer was reported to Elizabeth, she was astonished at e character of that aged pontiff; and having recalled her ambassador, e continued with more determined resolution to pursue those measures h already she had secretly embraced.



The queen, not to alarm the partisans of the Catholic religion, had d eleven of her sister’s counsellors; but in order to balance their y, she added eight more, who were known to be inclined to the Protestant communion: the marquis of Northampton, the earl of Bedford, Sir Thomas Parry, Sir Edward Rogers, Sir Ambrose Cave, Sir Francis Knolles, Sir Nicholas Bacon, whom she created lord keeper, and Sir William Cecil, y of state.[**]



With these counsellors, particularly Cecil, she frequently deliberated g the expediency of restoring the Protestant religion, and the s of executing that great enterprise. Cecil told her, that the greater t of the nation had, ever since her father’s reign, inclined to the n, and though her sister had constrained them to profess the t faith, the cruelties exercised by her ministers had still more d their affections from it: that happily the interests of the n here concurred with the inclinations of the people; nor was her e to the crown compatible with the authority of the Roman pontiff: t a sentence, so solemnly pronounced by two popes against her mother’s e, could not possibly be recalled without inflicting a mortal wound n the credit of the see of Rome; and even if she were allowed to retain e crown, it would only be on an uncertain and dependent footing: that s circumstance alone counterbalanced all dangers whatsoever; and these s themselves, if narrowly examined, would be found very little e: that the curses and execrations of the Romish church, when not d by military force, were, in the present age, more an object of e than of terror, and had now as little influence in this world as n the next: that though the bigotry or ambition of Henry or Philip might e them to execute a sentence of excommunication against her, their s were so incompatible, that they never could concur in any plan f operations; and the enmity of the one would always insure to her the p of the other: that if they encouraged the discontents of her Catholic subjects, their dominions also abounded with Protestants, and it d be easy to retaliate upon them: that even such of the English as d at present zealously attached to the Catholic faith, would, most of m, embrace the religion of their new sovereign; and the nation had of e e been so much accustomed to these revolutions, that men had lost all a of truth and falsehood in such subjects: that the authority of Henry VIII., so highly raised by many concurring circumstances, first inured the e to this submissive deference; and it was the less difficult for g princes to continue the nation in a track to which it had so g been accustomed; and that it would be easy for her, by bestowing on Protestants all preferment in civil offices and the militia, the church d the universities, both to insure her own authority, and to render her n entirely predominant.[*]



The education of Elizabeth, as well as her interest, led her to favor the n; and she remained not long in suspense with regard to the y which she should embrace. But though determined in her own mind, she d to proceed by gradual and secure steps, and not to imitate the e of Mary in encouraging the bigots of her party to make immediately a violent invasion on the established religion.[**] She thought it e, however, to discover such symptoms of her intentions as might e encouragement to the Protestants so much depressed by the late t persecutions. She immediately recalled all the exiles, and gave y to the prisoners who were confined on account of religion. We are d of a pleasantry of one Rainsford on this occasion, who said to the n, that he had a petition to present her in behalf of other prisoners d Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John: she readily replied, that it behoved r first to consult the prisoners themselves, and to learn of them r they desired that liberty which he demanded for them.[***]



Elizabeth also proceeded to exert in favor of the reformers some acts of r which were authorized by the extent of royal prerogative during that e. Finding that the Protestant teachers, irritated by persecution, broke t in a furious attack on the ancient superstition, and that the Romanists replied with no less zeal and acrimony, she published a n, by which she inhibited all preaching without a special e;[*] and though she dispensed with these orders in favor of some s of her own sect, she took care that they should be the most calm d moderate of the party. She also suspended the laws so far as to order a great part of the service; the litany, the Lord’s prayer, the creed, and e gospels; to be read in English. And having first published s, that all the churches should conform themselves to the e of her own chapel, she forbade the host to be any more elevated n her presence; an innovation which, however frivolous it may appear, d the most material consequences.[**]



These declarations of her intention, concurring with preceding suspicions, e the bishops foresee with certainty a revolution in religion. They e refused to officiate at her coronation; and it was with some y that the bishop of Carlisle was at last prevailed on to perform e ceremony. When she was conducted through London, amidst the joyful s of her subjects, a boy, who personated truth, was let down m one of the triumphal arches, and presented to her a copy of the Bible. She received the book with the most gracious deportment; placed it t her bosom; and declared that, amidst all the costly testimonies which e city had that day given her of their attachment, this present was by r the most precious and most acceptable.[*] Such were the innocent s by which Elizabeth insinuated herself into the affections of her s. Open in her address, gracious and affable in all public s, she rejoiced in the concourse of her subjects, entered into l their pleasures and amusements; and without departing from her y, which she knew well how to preserve, she acquired a popularity d what any of her predecessors or successors ever could attain. Her n sex exulted to see a woman hold the reins of empire with such prudence d fortitude: and while a young princess of twenty-five years, (for that s her age at her accession,) who possessed all the graces and n, though not all the beauty of her sex, courted the affections f individuals by her civilities, of the public by her services; her y though corroborated by the strictest bands of law and religion, d to be derived entirely from the choice and inclination of the e.



A sovereign of this disposition was not likely to offend her subjects by y useless or violent exertions of power; and Elizabeth, though she threw t such hints as encouraged the Protestants delayed the entire change of n till the meeting of the parliament, which was summoned to e. The elections had gone entirely against the Catholics, who seem t indeed to have made any great struggle for the superiority;[*] and the s met in a disposition of gratifying the queen in every particular h she could desire of them. They began the session with a unanimous n, “that Queen Elizabeth was, and ought to be, as well by the d of God, as the common and statute laws of the realm, the lawful, d, and true heir to the crown, lawfully descended from the blood l, according to the order of succession settled in the thirty-fifth of Henry VIII.”[**]



This act of recognition was probably dictated by the queen herself and her s; and she showed her magnanimity, as well as moderation, in the s which she employed on that occasion. She followed not Mary’s e in declaring the validity of her mother’s marriage, or in y repealing the act formerly made against her own legitimacy: she w that this attempt must be attended with reflections on her father’s y, and on the birth of her deceased sister; and as all the world was e, that Henry’s divorce from Anne Boleyn was merely the effect of s usual violence and caprice, she scorned to found her title on any act f an assembly which had too much prostituted its authority by its former e, servile, and iniquitous decisions. Satisfied, therefore, in the l opinion entertained with regard to this fact, which appeared the e undoubted, the less anxiety she discovered in fortifying it by votes d inquiries; she took possession of the throne both as her birthright, d as insured to her by former acts of parliament; and she never appeared s to distinguish these titles.[*]



The first bill brought into parliament with a view of trying their n on the head of religion, was that for suppressing the s lately erected, and for restoring the tenths and first-fruits o the queen. This point being gained without much difficulty, a bill was t introduced, annexing the supremacy to the crown; and though the queen s there denominated “governess,” not “head,” of the church, it conveyed e same extensive power which under the latter title had been exercised y her father and brother. All the bishops who were present in the upper e strenuously opposed this law; and as they possessed more learning n the temporal peers, they triumphed in the debate; but the majority of s in that house, as well as among the commons, was against them. By s act, the crown, without the concurrence either of the parliament, or n of the convocation, was vested with the whole spiritual power; might s all heresies, might establish or repeal all canons, might alter y point of discipline, and might ordain or abolish any religious rite r ceremony,[**]



In determining heresy, the sovereign was only limited (if that could be d a limitation) to such doctrines as had been adjudged heresy by the y of the Scripture, by the first four general councils, or by any l council which followed the Scripture as their rule, or to such r doctrines as should hereafter be denominated heresy by the t and convocation. In order to exercise this authority, the n, by a clause of the act, was empowered to name commissioners, either n or clergymen, as she should think proper; and on this clause was s founded the court of ecclesiastical commission; which assumed e discretionary, not to say arbitrary powers, totally incompatible h any exact boundaries in the constitution. Their proceedings, indeed, e only consistent with absolute monarchy; but were entirely suitable to e genius of the act on which they were established; an act that at once e the crown alone all the power which had formerly been claimed by the s, but which even these usurping prelates had never been able fully to e without some concurrence of the national clergy.



Whoever refused to take an oath acknowledging the queen’s supremacy, was d from holding any office; whoever denied the supremacy, or d to deprive the queen of that prerogative, forfeited, for the t offence, all his goods and chattels; for the second, was subjected o the penalty of a prÃ¦munire; but the third offence was declared treason.

These punishments, however severe, were less rigorous than those which e formerly, during the reigns of her father and brother, inflicted in e cases.



A law was passed confirming all the statutes enacted in King Edward’s time h regard to religion:[*] the nomination of bishops was given to the n, without any election of the chapters: the queen was empowered, on e vacancy of any see, to seize all the temporalities, and to bestow on e bishop elect an equivalent in the impropriations belonging to the n. This pretended equivalent was commonly much inferior in value; and s the queen, amidst all her concern for religion, followed the example f the preceding reformers in committing depredations on the l revenues.



The bishops and all incumbents were prohibited from alienating their s, and from letting leases longer than twenty-one years or three s. This law seemed to be meant for securing the property of the h; but as an exception was left in favor of the crown, great abuses l prevailed. It was usual for the courtiers, during this reign, to e an agreement with a bishop or incumbent; and to procure a fictitious n to the queen, who afterwards transferred the lands to the n agreed on.[**] This method of pillaging the church was not remedied l the beginning of James I. The present depression of the clergy d them to all injuries; and the laity never stopped till they had d the church to such poverty, that her plunder was no longer a n for the odium incurred by it.



A solemn and public disputation was held during this session in presence f Lord Keeper Bacon, between the divines of the Protestant and those of e Catholic communion. The champions appointed to defend the religion of e sovereign were, as in all former instances, entirely triumphant; and e Popish disputants, being pronounced refractory and obstinate, were n punished by imprisonment.[***]



Emboldened by this victory, the Protestants ventured on the last and most t step, and brought into parliament a bill[*] for abolishing the s and reestablishing the liturgy of King Edward. Penalties were d, as well against those who departed from this mode of worship, as t those who absented themselves from the church and the sacraments.

And thus in one session, without any violence, tumult, or clamor, was the e system of religion altered, on the very commencement of a reign, and y the will of a young woman, whose title to the crown was by many thought e to objections; an event which, though it may appear surprising to n in the present age, was every where expected on the first intelligence f Elizabeth’s accession.



The commons also made a sacrifice to the queen, more difficult to obtain n that of any articles of faith: they voted a subsidy of four shillings n the pound on land, and two shillings and eightpence on movables, r with two fifteenths.[**] 1 The house in no instance d from the most respectful deference and complaisance towards the n. Even the importune address which they made her on the conclusion of e session, to fix her choice of a husband, could not, they supposed, be y disagreeable to one of her sex and age. The address was couched in e most respectful expressions, yet met with a refusal from the queen.



1559.



She told the speaker, that, as the application from the house was d in general terms, only recommending marriage, without pretending o direct her choice of a husband, she could not take offence at the s, or regard it otherwise than as a new instance of their e attachment to her: that any further interposition on their t, would have ill become either them to make as subjects, or her to r as an independent princess: that even while she was a private person, d exposed to much danger, she had always declined that engagement, which e regarded as an encumbrance; much more, at present, would she persevere n this sentiment, when the charge of a great kingdom was committed to r, and her life ought to be entirely devoted to promoting the interests f religion and the happiness of her subjects: that as England was her d, wedded to her by this pledge, (and here she showed her finger h the same gold ring upon it with which she had solemnly betrothed f to the kingdom at her inauguration,) so all Englishmen were her n, and while she was employed in rearing or governing such a y, she could not deem herself barren, or her life useless and e: that if she ever entertained thoughts of changing her n, the care of her subjects’ welfare would still be uppermost in r thoughts; but should she live and die a virgin, she doubted not but e Providence, seconded by their counsels and her own measures, would e able to prevent all dispute with regard to the succession, and secure m a sovereign who, perhaps better than her own issue, would imitate her e in loving and cherishing her people; and that for her part, she d that no higher character, or fairer remembrance of her should be d to posterity, than to have this inscription engraved on her e, when she should pay the last debt to nature: “Here lies Elizabeth, who lived and died a maiden queen.”[*]



After the prorogation of the parliament,[**] the laws enacted with regard o religion were put in execution, and met with little opposition from any r. The liturgy was again introduced in the vulgar tongue, and the h of supremacy was tendered to the clergy. The number of bishops had n reduced to fourteen by a sickly season which preceded: and all these, t the bishop of Landaff, having refused compliance, were degraded m their sees: but of the inferior clergy throughout all England, where e are near ten thousand parishes, only eighty rectors and vicars, y prebendaries fifteen heads of colleges, twelve archdeacons, and as y deans, sacrificed their livings to their religious principles.[***]



Those in high ecclesiastic stations, being exposed to the eyes of the c, seem chiefly to have placed a point of honor in their e; but on the whole, the Protestants, in the former change d by Mary, appear to have been much more rigid and conscientious.

Though the Catholic religion, adapting itself to the senses, and enjoining s which enter into the common train of life, does at present lay r hold on the mind than the reformed, which, being chiefly spiritual, s more a system of metaphysics, yet was the proportion of zeal, as l as of knowledge, during the first ages after the reformation, much r on the side of the Protestants. The Catholics continued, y and supinely, in their ancient belief, or rather their ancient s: but the reformers, obliged to dispute on every occasion, and d to a degree of enthusiasm by novelty and persecution had strongly d themselves to their tenets; and were ready to sacrifice their s, and even their lives, in support of their speculative and t principles.



The forms and ceremonies still preserved in the English liturgy, as they e some resemblance to the ancient service, tended further to reconcile e Catholics to the established religion; and as the queen permitted no r mode of worship, and at the same time struck out every thing that d be offensive to them in the new liturgy,[*] even those who were d to the Romish communion made no scruple of attending the d church. Had Elizabeth gratified her own inclinations, the r appearance, which is the chief circumstance with the people, d have been still more similar between the new and the ancient form of p. Her love of state and magnificence, which she affected in every g, inspired her with an inclination towards the pomp of the Catholic n; and it was merely in compliance with the prejudices of her y, that she gave up either images, or the addresses to saints, or s for the dead.[**] Some foreign princes interposed to procure the Romanists the privilege of separate assemblies in particular cities, but e queen would not comply with their request; and she represented the t danger of disturbing the national peace by a toleration of t religions.[***]



While the queen and parliament were employed in settling the public n, the negotiations for a peace were still conducted, first at Cercamp, then at Chateau-Cambresis, between the ministers of France, Spain, and England; and Elizabeth, though equally prudent, was not equally l in this transaction. Philip employed his utmost efforts to e the restitution of Calais, both as bound in honor to indemnify England which merely on his account had been drawn into the war; and as d in interest to remove France to a distance from his frontiers in e Low Countries. So long as he entertained hopes of espousing the queen, e delayed concluding a peace with Henry; and even after the change of n in England deprived him of all such views, his ministers hinted o her a proposal which may be regarded as reasonable and honorable.

Though all his own terms with France were settled, he seemed willing to e the war till she should obtain satisfaction; provided she would e to adhere to the Spanish alliance, and continue hostilities t Henry during the course of six years:[*]* but Elizabeth, after g with her ministers, wisely rejected this proposal. She was e of the low state of her finances; the great debts contracted by r father, brother, and sister; the disorders introduced into every part f the administration; the divisions by which her people were agitated; d she was convinced that nothing but tranquillity during some years d bring the kingdom again into a flourishing condition, or enable her o act with dignity and vigor in her transactions with foreign nations.

Well acquainted with the value which Henry put upon Calais, and the y, during the present emergence, of recovering it by treaty, e was willing rather to suffer that loss, than submit to such a e on Spain, as she must expect to fall into, if she continued y in her present demand. She ordered, therefore, her s, Lord Effingham, the bishop of Ely, and Dr. Wotton, to e the negotiation, and to settle a peace with Henry on any e terms. Henry offered to stipulate a marriage between the eldest r of the dauphin, and the eldest son of Elizabeth; and to engage r the restitution of Calais as the dowry of that princess;[**] but as e queen was sensible that this treaty would appear to the world a e evasion, she insisted upon more equitable, at least more e conditions.



Philip and Henry terminated hostilities by a mutual restitution of all s taken during the course of the war; and Philip espoused the s Elizabeth, eldest daughter of France, formerly betrothed to his n Don Carlos. The duke of Savoy married Margaret, Henry’s sister, and d a restitution of all his dominions of Savoy and Piedmont, except a few towns retained by France. And thus general tranquillity seemed to be d to Europe.



But though peace was concluded between France and England, there soon d a ground of quarrel of the most serious nature, and which was s attended with the most important consequences. The two s of Henry VIII., that with Catharine of Arragon, and that with Anne Boleyn, were incompatible with each other; and it seemed impossible t both of them could be regarded as valid and legal: but still the h of Elizabeth lay under some disadvantages to which that of her r Mary was not exposed. Henry’s first marriage had obtained the n of all the powers, both civil and ecclesiastical, which were then d in England; and it was natural for Protestants as well as Romanists to allow, on account of the sincere intention of the parties, t their issue ought to be regarded as legitimate, But his divorce and d marriage had been concluded in direct opposition to the see of Rome; and though they had been ratified by the authority both of the English parliament and convocation, those who were strongly attached to e Catholic communion, and who reasoned with great strictness were led to d them as entirely invalid, and to deny altogether the queen’s right f succession. The next heir of blood was the queen of Scots, now married o the dauphin; and the great power of that princess, joined to her e title rendered her a formidable rival to Elizabeth. The king of France had secretly been soliciting at Rome a bull of excommunication t the queen; and she had here been beholden to the good offices of Philip, who, from interest more than either friendship or generosity, had d in her favor, and had successfully opposed the pretensions of Henry. But the court of France was not discouraged with this repulse; the e of Guise and his brothers, thinking that it would much augment their t if their niece should bring an accession of England, as she had y done of Scotland, to the crown of France, engaged the king not to t the claim; and, by their persuasion, he ordered his son and r-in-law to assume openly the arms as well as title of England, and o quarter these arms on all their equipages, furniture, and liveries.

When the English ambassador complained of this injury he could obtain g but an evasive answer; that as the queen of Scots was descended m the blood royal of England, she was entitled, by the example of many s, to assume the arms of that kingdom. But besides that this e had never prevailed without permission being first obtained, and t making a visible difference between the arms, Elizabeth plainly w that this pretension had not been advanced during the reign of her r Mary; and that, therefore, the king of France intended, on the t opportunity, to dispute her legitimacy, and her title to the crown.

Alarmed at the danger, she thenceforth conceived a violent jealousy t the queen of Scots; and was determined, as far as possible, to e Henry from the execution of his project. The sudden death of t monarch, who was killed in a tournament at Paris, while celebrating e espousals of his sister with the duke of Savoy, altered not her views.

Being informed that his successor, Francis II., still continued to assume, t reserve, the title of King of England, she began to consider him d his queen as her mortal enemies; and the present situation of affairs n Scotland afforded her a favorable opportunity, both of revenging the y, and providing for her own safety.



The murder of the cardinal-primate at St. Andrew’s had deprived the Scottish Catholics of a head whose severity, courage, and capacity had d him extremely formidable to the innovators in religion; and the n of the laws against heresy began thenceforth to be more remiss.

The queen regent governed the kingdom by prudent and moderate counsels; d as she was not disposed to sacrifice the civil interests of the state o the bigotry or interests of the clergy, she deemed it more expedient to e, and to connive at the progress of a doctrine which she had not r entirely to repress. When informed of the death of Edward, and the n of Mary to the crown of England, she entertained hopes that the Scottish reformers, deprived of the countenance which they received from t powerful kingdom, would lose their ardor with their prospect of s, and would gradually return to the faith of their ancestors. But e progress and revolutions of religion are little governed by the usual s of civil policy; and the event much disappointed the expectations f the regent. Many of the English preachers, terrified with the severity f Mary’s government, took shelter in Scotland, where they found more n, and a milder administration; and while they propagated their l tenets, they filled the whole kingdom with a just horror t the cruelties of the bigoted Catholics, and showed their disciples e fate which they must expect, if ever their adversaries should attain n uncontrolled authority over them.



A hierarchy, moderate in its acquisitions of power and riches, may safely t a toleration to sectaries; and the more it softens the zeal of s by lenity and liberty, the more securely will it possess those s which the legal establishments bestow upon it. But where n has raised a church to such an exorbitant height as that of Rome, persecution is less the result of bigotry in the priests, than of a y policy; and the rigor of law is the only method of repelling the s of men who, besides religious zeal, have so many other motives, d both from public and private interest, to engage them on the side f innovation. But though such overgrown hierarchies may long support s by these violent expedients, the time comes when severities d only to enrage the new sectaries, and make them break through all s of reason and moderation. This crisis was now visibly approaching n Scotland; and whoever considers merely the transactions resulting from t, will be inclined to throw the blame equally on both parties; whoever s his view, and reflects on the situations, will remark the y progress of human affairs, and the operation of those principles h are inherent in human nature.



Some heads of the reformers in Scotland, such as the earl of Argyle, his n Lord Lorne, the earls of Morton and Glencarne, Erskine of Dun, and s, observing the danger to which they were exposed, and desirous to e their principles, entered privately into a bond or association; d called themselves the “congregation” of the Lord, in contradistinction o the established church, which they denominated the congregation of Satan. The tenor of the bond was as follows: “We, perceiving how Satan, in s members, the Antichrist of our time, do cruelly rage, seeking to w and to destroy the gospel of Christ and his congregation, ought, g to our bounden duty, to strive in our master’s cause, even unto e death, being certain of the victory in him.

Had the subscribers of this zealous league been content only to demand a n of the new opinions, however incompatible their pretensions t have been with the policy of the church of Rome, they would have had e praise of opposing tyrannical laws, enacted to support an t prejudicial to civil society: but it is plain that they d their views much further; and their practice immediately d the spirit by which they were actuated. Supported by the y which they thought belonged to them as the congregation of the Lord, they ordained that prayers in the vulgar tongue[*] should be used in l the parish churches of the kingdom; and that preaching and the n of the Scriptures should be practised in private houses, l God should move the prince to grant public preaching by faithful and e ministers.[**] Such bonds of association are always the fore-runners f rebellion; and this violent invasion of the established religion was e actual commencement of it.



Before this league was publicly known or avowed, the clergy, alarmed with e progress of the reformation, attempted to recover their lost authority y a violent exercise of power, which tended still further to augment the l and number of their enemies. Hamilton, the primate, seized Walter Mill, a priest of an irreproachable life, who had embraced the new s; and having tried him at St. Andrew’s, condemned him to the s for heresy. Such general aversion was entertained against this y, that it was some time before the bishops could prevail on any e to act the part of a civil judge, and pronounce sentence upon Mill; d even after the time of his execution was fixed, all the shops of St.

Andrew’s being shut, no one would sell a rope to tie him to the stake and e primate himself was obliged to furnish this implement. The man bore e torture with that courage which, though usual on these occasions, s appears supernatural and astonishing to the multitude. The people, o express their abhorrence against the cruelty of the priests, raised a t of stones on the place of his execution; and as fast as the s were removed by order of the clergy, they were again supplied from e voluntary zeal of the populace.[***] It is in vain for men to oppose e severest punishment to the united motives of religion and public e; and this was the last barbarity of the kind which the Catholics d the power to exercise in Scotland.



Some time after, the people discovered their sentiments in such a manner s was sufficient to prognosticate to the priests the fate which was g them. It was usual on the festival of St. Giles, the tutelar t of Edinburgh, to carry in procession the image of that saint; but e Protestants, in order to prevent the ceremony, found means, on the eve f the festival, to purloin the statue from the church; and they pleased s with imagining the surprise and disappointment of his votaries.

The clergy, however, framed hastily a new image, which in derision was d by the people young St. Giles; and they carried it through the s, attended by all the ecclesiastics in the town and neighborhood.

The multitude abstained from violence so long as the queen regent d a spectator; but the moment she retired, they invaded the idol, w it in the mire, and broke it in pieces. The flight and terror of the s and friars, who, it was remarked, deserted, in his greatest s, the object of their worship, was the source of universal mockery d laughter.



Encouraged by all these appearances, the congregation proceeded with y in openly soliciting subscriptions to their league; and the death f Mary of England, with the accession of Elizabeth, which happened about s time, contributed to increase their hopes of final success in their g. They ventured to present a petition to the regent, craving a n of the church, and of the “wicked, scandalous, and detestable” s of the prelates and ecclesiastics.[*] They framed a petition which y intended to present to parliament, and in which, after premising that y could not communicate with the damnable idolatry and intolerable s of the Papistical church, they desired that the laws against s should be executed by the civil magistrate alone, and that the Scripture should be the sole rule in judging of heresy.[**] They even d the convocation, and insisted that prayers should be said in e vulgar tongue, and that bishops should be chosen with the consent of e gentry of the diocese, and priests with the consent of the s.[***] The regent prudently temporized between these parties; d as she aimed at procuring a matrimonial crown for her son-in-law the n, she was, on that as well as other accounts, unwilling to come to s with either of them.



But after this concession was obtained, she received orders from France, y dictated by the violent spirit of her brothers, to proceed with r against the reformers, and to restore the royal authority by some l act of power.[*] She made the more eminent of the Protestant s be cited to appear before the council at Stirling; but when their s were marching thither in great multitudes, in order to protect d countenance them, she entertained apprehensions of an insurrection, d, it is said, dissipated the people by a promise[**] 2 that g should be done to the prejudice of the ministers. Sentence, r, was passed, by which all the ministers were pronounced rebels, on t of their not appearing; a measure which enraged the people, and e them resolve to oppose the regent’s authority by force of arms, and o proceed to extremities against the clergy of the established religion.



In this critical time, John Knox arrived from Geneva, where he had passed e years in banishment, and where he had imbibed, from his commerce with Calvin, the highest fanaticism of his sect, augmented by the native y of his own character. He had been invited back to Scotland by the s of the reformation; and mounting the pulpit at Perth, during the t ferment of men’s minds, he declaimed with his usual vehemence t the idolatry and other abominations of the church of Rome, and d his audience to exert their utmost zeal for its subversion. A t was so imprudent, after this sermon, as to open his repository of s and relics, and prepare himself to say mass. The audience, exalted o a disposition for any furious enterprise, were as much enraged as if e spectacle had not been quite familiar to them: they attacked the t with fury, broke the images in pieces, tore the pictures, overthrew e altars, scattered about the sacred vases; and left no implement of s worship, as they termed it, entire or undefaced. They thence d, with additional numbers and augmented rage, to the monasteries f the Gray and Black friars, which they pillaged in an instant: the Carthusians underwent the same fate: and the populace, not content with g and expelling the monks, vented their fury on the buildings which d been the receptacles of such abomination; and in a little time nothing t the walls of these edifices were left standing. The inhabitants of Coupar, in Fife, soon after imitated the example.[***]



The queen regent, provoked at these violences, assembled an army, and d to chastise the rebels. She had about two thousand French under r command, with a few Scottish troops; and being assisted by such of the y as were well affected to her, she pitched her camp within ten s of Perth. Even the earl of Argyle, and Lord James Stuart, prior of St. Andrew’s, the queen’s natural brother, though deeply engaged with the s, attended the regent in this enterprise, either because they d the fury of the populace, or hoped by their own influence and y to mediate some agreement between the parties. The congregation, n the other hand, made preparations for defence; and being joined by the l of Glencarne from the west, and being countenanced by many of the y and gentry, they appeared formidable from their numbers, as well s from the zeal by which they were animated. They sent an address to the t, where they plainly insinuated, that if they were pursued to s by the “cruel beasts” the churchmen, they would have recourse o foreign powers for assistance; and they subscribed themselves her l subjects in all things not repugnant to God, assuming, at the e time, the name of the faithful congregation of Christ Jesus.[*] They d to the nobility attending her, and maintained, that their own past s were justified by the word of God, which commands the godly to y idolatry, and all the monuments of it; and though all civil y was sacred, yet was there a great difference between the y and the persons who exercised it;[**] and that it ought to be d, whether or not those abominations, called by the pestilent Papists religion, and which they defend by fire and sword, be the true n of Christ Jesus. They remonstrated with such of the queen’s army s had formerly embraced their party, and told them, “that as they were y reputed traitors by God, they should likewise be excommunicated m their society, and from the participation of the sacraments of the h which God by his mighty power had erected among them; whose s have the same authority which Christ granted to his apostles in e words, ‘Whose sins ye shall forgive shall be forgiven, and whose s ye shall retain shall be retained.’”[***]



We may here see, that these new saints were no less lofty in their s than the ancient hierarchy: no wonder they were enraged t the latter as their rivals in dominion. They joined to all these s an address to the established church; and they affixed this e to it: “To the generation of Antichrist, the pestilent prelates and r ‘shavelings'[*] in Scotland, the congregation of Christ Jesus within e same sayeth.” The tenor of the manifesto was suitable to the title.

They told the ecclesiastics, “As ye by tyranny intend not only to destroy r bodies, but also by the same to hold our souls in bondage of the l, subject to idolatry, so shall we, with all the force and power h God shall grant unto us, execute just vengeance and punishment upon u: yea, we shall begin that same war which God commanded Israel to e against the Canaanites; that is, contract of peace shall never be e till you desist from your open idolatry, and cruel persecution of God’s children. And this, in the name of the eternal God, and of his Son Christ Jesus, whose verity we profess, and gospel we have preached, and y sacraments rightly administered, we signify unto you to be our t, so far as God will assist us to withstand your idolatry. Take this r warning, and be not deceived.”[**] With these outrageous symptoms d in Scotland that cant, hypocrisy, and fanaticism which long d that kingdom, and which, though now mollified by the lenity of e civil power, is still ready to break out on all occasions.



The queen regent, finding such obstinate zeal in the rebels, was content o embrace the counsels of Argyle and the prior of St. Andrew’s, and to m an accommodation with them. She was received into Perth, which d, on her promising an indemnity for past offences, and engaging t to leave any French garrison in the place. Complaints, very ill d, immediately arose concerning the infraction of this capitulation.

Some of the inhabitants, it was pretended, were molested on account of the e violences; and some companies of Scotch soldiers, supposed to be in French pay, were quartered in the town; which step, though taken on very e grounds, was loudly exclaimed against by the congregation.[***]



It is asserted that the regent, to justify these measures, declared, that s ought not to have their promises too strictly urged upon them; nor s any faith to be kept with heretics: and that for her part, could she d as good a color, she would willingly bereave all these men of their s and fortunes.[*] But it is nowise likely that such expressions ever d from this prudent and virtuous princess. On the contrary, it s that all these violences were disagreeable to her; that she was in s particular overruled by the authority of the French counsellors d about her; and that she often thought, if the management of those s had been intrusted wholly to herself, she could easily, without e, have accommodated all differences.[**] 3


The congregation, inflamed with their own zeal, and enraged by these s, remained not long in tranquillity. Even before they left Perth, and while as yet they had no color to complain of any violation of y, they had signed a new covenant, in which, besides their s to mutual defence, they vowed, in the name of God, to employ r whole power in destroying every thing that dishonored his holy name; d this covenant was subscribed, among others, by Argyle and the prior of St. Andrew’s.[***]



These two leaders now desired no better pretence for deserting the regent d openly joining their associates, than the complaints, however l, or rather false, of her breach of promise. The congregation o, encouraged by this accession of force, gave themselves up entirely o the furious zeal of Knox, and renewed at Crail, Anstruther, and other s in Fife, like depredations on the churches and monasteries with e formerly committed at Perth and Coupar. The regent, who marched t them with her army, finding their power so much increased, was d to conclude a truce for a few days, and to pass over with her forces o the Lothians. The reformers besieged and took Perth; proceeded thence o Stirling, where they exercised their usual fury; and finding nothing e to resist them, they bent their march to Edinburgh, the inhabitants f which, as they had already anticipated the zeal of the congregation t the churches and monasteries, gladly opened their gates to them.

The regent, with the few forces which remained with her, took shelter in Dunbar, where she fortified herself, in expectation of a reÃ«nforcement m France.



Meanwhile, she employed her partisans in representing to the people the s consequences of this open rebellion; and she endeavored to e them, that the Lord James, under pretence of religion, had formed e scheme of wresting the sceptre from the hands of the sovereign. By e considerations many were engaged to desert the army of the n; but much more by the want of pay, or any means of e; and the regent, observing the malecontents to be much d, ventured to march to Edinburgh, with a design of suppressing m. On the interposition of the duke of Chatelrault, who still adhered o her, she agreed to a capitulation, in which she granted them a n of their religion, and they engaged to commit no further s on the churches. Soon after, they evacuated the city; and e they left it, they proclaimed the articles of agreement; but they k care to publish only the articles favorable to themselves, and they e guilty of an imposture, in adding one to the number, namely, that y should not again be erected in any place where it was at that e suppressed.[*] 4


An agreement concluded while men were in this disposition, could not be e; and both sides endeavored to strengthen themselves as much as e against the ensuing rupture, which appeared inevitable. The t, having got a reÃ«nforcement of one thousand men from France, began o fortify Leith; and the congregation seduced to their party the duke of Chatelrault, who had long appeared inclined to join them, and who was at t determined by the arrival of his son, the earl of Arran, from France, e he had escaped many dangers from the jealousy, as well as bigotry, f Henry and the duke of Guise. More French troops soon after disembarked r the command of La Brosse, who was followed by the bishop of Amiens, d three doctors of the Sorbonne. These last were supplied with store of s, authorities, citations, and scholastic arguments, which they d to oppose to the Scottish preachers, and which, they justly d, would acquire force, and produce conviction, by the influence of e French arms and artillery.[**]



The constable Montmorency had always opposed the marriage of the dauphin h the queen of Scots, and had foretold that, by forming such close s with Scotland, the ancient league would be dissolved; and the s of that kingdom, jealous of a foreign yoke, would soon become, d of allies, attached by interest and inclination, the most e enemies to the French government. But though the event seemed w to have justified the prudence of that aged minister, it is not e, considering the violent counsels by which France was governed, t the insurrection was deemed a favorable event; as affording a e for sending over armies, for entirely subduing the country, for g the rebels,[*] and for preparing means thence to invade England, and support Mary’s title to the crown of that kingdom. The s of the congregation, well acquainted with these views, were not e of their danger, and saw that their only safety consisted in e vigor and success of their measures. They were encouraged by the e received of the sudden death of Henry II.; and having passed n act from their own authority, depriving the queen dowager of the y, and ordering all the French troops to evacuate the kingdom, they d forces to put their edict in execution against them. They again e masters of Edinburgh; but found themselves unable to keep long n of that city. Their tumultuary armies, assembled in haste, and d by no pay, soon separated upon the least disaster, or even any y of success; and were incapable of resisting such veteran troops as e French, who were also seconded by some of the Scottish nobility, among m the earl of Bothwell distinguished himself., Hearing that the marquis f Elbeuf, brother to the regent, was levying an army against them in Germany, they thought themselves excusable for applying, in this y, to the assistance of England; and as the sympathy of religion, s well as regard to national liberty, had now counterbalanced the ancient y against that kingdom, this measure was the result of inclination o less than of interest.[**] 5 Maitland of Lidington, therefore, and Robert Melvil, were secretly despatched by the congregation to solicit succors m Elizabeth.



The wise council of Elizabeth did not long deliberate in agreeing to this t, which concurred so well with the views and interests of their s. Cecil in particular represented to the queen, that the union of e crowns of Scotland and France, both of them the hereditary enemies of England, was ever regarded as a pernicious event; and her father, as well s Protector Somerset, had employed every expedient both of war and n to prevent it: that the claim which Mary advanced to the crown d the present situation of England still more dangerous, and d on the part of the queen the greatest vigilance and precaution; t the capacity, ambition, and exorbitant views of the family of Guise, o now governed the French counsels, were sufficiently known; and they s made no secret of their design to place their niece on the e of England: that deeming themselves secure of success, they had y, somewhat imprudently and prematurely, taken off the mask; and Throgmorton, the English ambassador at Paris, sent over, by every courier, e proofs of their hostile intentions:[*] that they only waited l Scotland should be entirely subdued; and having thus deprived the English of the advantages resulting from their situation and naval power, y prepared means for subverting the queen’s authority: that the zealous Catholics in England, discontented with the present government, and d in the legality of Mary’s title, would bring them considerable eÃ«nforcement, and would disturb every measure of defence against that e power: that the only expedient for preventing these designs, s to seize the present opportunity, and take advantage of a like zeal in e Protestants of Scotland; nor could any doubt be entertained with d to the justice of a measure founded on such evident necessity, and d only to the ends of self-preservation: that though a French war, d with great expense, seemed the necessary consequence of g the malecontents in Scotland, that power, if removed to the t, would be much less formidable; and a small disbursement at t would, in the end, be found the greatest frugality: and that the c dissensions of France, which every day augmented, together with e alliance of Philip, who, notwithstanding his bigotry and hypocrisy, d never permit the entire conquest of England, were sufficient to e the queen against the dangerous ambition and resentment of the e of Guise.[**]



Elizabeth’s propensity to caution and economy was, though with some y,[*] overcome by these powerful motives and she prepared herself o support by arms and money the declining affairs of the congregation in Scotland. She equipped a fleet, which consisted of thirteen ships of war; d giving the command of it to Winter, she sent it to the Frith of Forth: e appointed the young duke of Norfolk her lieutenant in the northern s; and she assembled, at Berwick, an army of eight thousand men r the command of Lord Gray, warden of the east and middle marches.

Though the court of France, sensible of the danger, offered her to make e restitution of Calais, provided she would not interpose in the s of Scotland, she resolutely replied, that she never would put an e fishing-town in competition with the safety of her s;[**] and she still continued her preparations. She concluded a y of mutual defence with the congregation, which was to last during e marriage of the queen of Scots with Francis, and a year after; and she d never to desist till the French had entirely evacuated Scotland.[***] And having thus taken all proper measures for success, and d from the Scots six hostages for the performance of articles, she d her fleet and army to begin their operations.



1560.



The appearance of Elizabeth’s fleet in the frith disconcerted the French y, who were at that time ravaging the county of Fife; and obliged them o make a circuit by Stirling, in order to reach Leith, where they d themselves for defence. The English army, reÃ«nforced by five d Scots,[*] sat down before the place; and after two skirmishes, in e former of which the English had the advantage, in the latter the French, they began to batter the town; and, though repulsed with e loss in a rash and ill-conducted assault, they reduced the n to great difficulties. Their distress was augmented by two s; the dispersion by a storm of D’Elbeuf’s fleet, which carried a e army on board,[**] and the death of the queen, regent, who d about this time in the Castle of Edinburgh; a woman endowed with l the capacity which shone forth in her family, but possessed of much e virtue and moderation than appeared in the conduct of the other s of it. The French, who found it impossible to subsist for want of s, and who saw that the English were continually reÃ«nforced by h numbers, were obliged to capitulate; and the bishop of Valence and Count Randan, plenipotentiaries from France, signed a treaty at Edinburgh h Cecil and Dr. Wotton, whom Elizabeth had sent thither for that e. It was there stipulated, that the French should instantly e Scotland; that the king and queen of France and Scotland should h abstain from bearing the arms of England, or assuming the e of that kingdom; that further satisfaction for the injury already e in that particular should be granted Elizabeth; and that s should meet to settle this point, or, if they could not e, that the king of Spain should be umpire between the crowns. Besides e stipulations, which regarded England, some concessions were granted o the Scots; namely, that an amnesty should be published for all past s; that none but natives should enjoy any office in Scotland; that e states should name twenty-four persons, of whom the queen of Scots d choose seven, and the states five, and in the hands of these twelve d the whole administration be placed during their queen’s absence; d that Mary should neither make peace nor war without consent of the s.[***] In order to hasten the execution of this important treaty, Elizabeth sent ships, by which the French forces were transported into r own country.



Thus Europe saw, in the first transaction of this reign, the genius and y of the queen and her ministers. She discerned at a distance the r which threatened her; and instantly took vigorous measures to t it. Making all possible advantages of her situation, she proceeded h celerity to a decision; and was not diverted by any offers, s, or remonstrances of the French court. She stopped not till e had brought the matter to a final issue; and had converted that very r, to which her enemies trusted for her destruction, into her firmest t and security. By exacting no improper conditions from the Scottish s, even during their greatest distresses, she established an e confidence with them; and having cemented the union by all the ties f gratitude, interest, and religion, she now possessed an influence over m beyond what remained even with their native sovereign. The regard h she acquired by this dexterous and spirited conduct, gave her every e, abroad as well as at home, more authority than had attended her r, though supported by all the power of the Spanish monarchy.[*]



The subsequent measures of the Scottish reformers tended still more to t their union with England. Being now entirely masters of the m, they made no further ceremony or scruple in fully effecting their e. In the treaty of Edinburgh, it had been agreed, that a parliament r convention should soon be assembled; and the leaders of the n, not waiting till the queen of Scots should ratify that y, thought themselves fully entitled, without the sovereign’s y, immediately to summon a parliament. The reformers presented a n to this assembly, in which they were not contented with desiring e establishment of their doctrine, they also applied for the punishment f the Catholics, whom they called vassals to the Roman harlot; and they d, that among all the rabble of the clergy—such is their n—there was not one lawful minister; but that they were all f them thieves and murderers; yea, rebels and traitors to civil y, and therefore unworthy to be suffered in any reformed h.[**] The parliament seem to have been actuated by the same t of rage and persecution. After ratifying a confession of faith e to the new doctrines, they passed a statute against the mass, d not only abolished it in all the churches, but enacted, that whoever y where either officiated in it, or was present at it, should be d, for the first offence, with confiscation of goods and corporal t, at the discretion of the magistrate; for the second, with t; and for the third, with loss of life.[***]



A law was also voted for abolishing the papal jurisdiction in Scotland: e Presbyterian form of discipline was settled, leaving only at first e shadow of authority to certain ecclesiastics, whom they called s. The prelates of the ancient faith appeared, in order to n of great injustice committed on them by the invasion of their y, but the parliament took no notice of them; till at last these s, tired with fruitless attendance, departed the town. They e then cited to appear; and as nobody presented himself, it was voted y the parliament, that the ecclesiastics were entirely satisfied, and d no reason of complaint.



Sir James Sandilands, prior of St. John, was sent over to France to obtain e ratification of these acts; but was very ill received by Mary, who d the validity of a parliament summoned without the royal consent; d she refused her sanction to those statutes. But the Protestants gave s little concern about their queen’s refusal. They immediately t the statutes in execution; they abolished the mass; they settled their s; they committed every where furious devastations on the s, and even on the churches, which they thought profaned by y; and deeming the property of the clergy lawful prize, they took n, without ceremony, of the far greater part of the l revenues. Their new preachers, who had authority sufficient o incite them to war and insurrection, could not restrain their rapacity; d fanaticism concurring with avarice, an incurable wound was given to e papal authority in that country. The Protestant nobility and gentry, d by the consciousness of such unpardonable guilt, alarmed for their w possessions, well acquainted with the imperious character of the house f Guise, saw no safety for themselves but in the protection of England; d they despatched Morton, Glencarne, and Lidington, to express their e gratitude to the queen for her past favors, and represent to her e necessity of continuing them.



Elizabeth, on her part, had equal reason to maintain a union with the Scottish Protestants; and soon found that the house of Guise, g their former disappointments, had not laid aside the n of contesting her title, and subverting her authority. Francis and Mary, whose counsels were wholly directed by them, refused to ratify the y of Edinburgh and showed no disposition to give her any satisfaction r that mortal affront which they had put upon her, by their openly g the title and arms of England. She was sensible of the danger g such pretensions; and it was with pleasure she heard of the t factions which prevailed in the French government, and of the n which had arisen against the measures of the duke of Guise.

That ambitious prince, supported by his four brothers, the cardinal of Lorraine, the duke of Aumale, the marquis of Elbeuf, and the grand prior, n no less ambitious than himself, had engrossed all the authority of the n; and as he was possessed of every quality which could command the m or seduce the affections of men, there appeared no end of his s and pretensions. The constable, Montmorency, who had long d his credit, was deprived of all power: the princes of the blood, e king of Navarre, and his brother, the prince of CondÃ©, were entirely d from offices and favor: the queen mother herself, Catharine de Medicis, found her influence every day declining; and as Francis, a young e, infirm both in mind and body, was wholly governed by his consort, o knew no law but the pleasure of her uncles, men despaired of ever g freedom from the dominion of that aspiring family. It was the s of religion which first inspired the French with courage openly o oppose their unlimited authority.



The theological disputes, first started in the north of Germany, next in Switzerland, countries at that time wholly illiterate, had long ago d into France; and as they were assisted by the general t against the court and church of Rome, and by the zealous spirit f the age, the proselytes to the new religion were secretly increasing in y province. Henry II., in imitation of his father, Francis, had d the progress of the reformers; and though a prince addicted to e and society, he was transported by a vehemence, as well as y, which had little place in the conduct of his predecessor.

Rigorous punishments had been inflicted on the most eminent of the Protestant party; and a point of honor seemed to have arisen, whether the e sect could exercise, or the other suffer, most barbarity. The death of Henry put some stop to the persecutions; and the people, who had admired e constancy of the new preachers, now heard with favor their doctrines d arguments. But the cardinal of Lorraine, as well as his brothers, who e possessed of the legal authority, thought it their interest to t the established religion; and when they revived the execution of e penal statutes, they necessarily drove the malecontent princes and s to embrace the protection of the new religion. The king of Navarre, a man of mild dispositions, but of a weak character, and the prince of CondÃ©, who possessed many great qualities, having declared themselves in r of the Protestants, that sect acquired new force from their e; and the admiral, Coligny, with his brother Andelot, no longer d to make open profession of their communion. The integrity of the l, who was believed sincere in his attachment to the new doctrine, d his great reputation both for valor and conduct, for the arts of peace s well as of war brought credit to the reformers; and after a frustrated t of the malecontents to seize the king’s person at Amboise of which Elizabeth had probably some intelligence,[*] every place was full of n, and matters hastened to an open rupture between the parties.

But the house of Guise, though these factions had obliged them to remit r efforts in Scotland, and had been one chief cause of Elizabeth’s s, were determined not to relinquish their authority in France, or d to the violence of their enemies. They found an opportunity of g the king of Navarre and the prince of CondÃ©; they threw the former o prison; they obtained a sentence of death against the latter; and y were proceeding to put the sentence in execution, when the king’s n death saved the noble prisoner, and interrupted the prosperity of e duke of Guise. The queen mother was appointed regent to her son Charles IX., now in his minority: the king of Navarre was named t-general of the kingdom: the sentence against CondÃ© was d: the constable was recalled to court: and the family of Guise, h they still enjoyed great offices and great power, found a e to their authority.



1561.



Elizabeth was determined to make advantage of these events against the n of Scots, whom she still regarded as a dangerous rival. She saw f freed from the perils attending a union of Scotland with France, d from the pretensions of so powerful a prince as Francis; but she d, at the same time, that the English Catholics, who were s, and who were generally prejudiced in favor of Mary’s title, d now adhere to that princess with more zealous attachment, when they w that her succession no longer endangered the liberties of the kingdom, d was rather attended with the advantage of effecting an entire union h Scotland. She gave orders, therefore, to her ambassador, Throgmorton, a vigilant and able minister, to renew his applications to the queen of Scots, and to require her ratification of the treaty of Edinburgh. But h Mary had desisted, after her husband’s death, from bearing the arms d title of Queen of England, she still declined gratifying Elizabeth in s momentous article; and being swayed by the ambitious suggestions of r uncles, she refused to make any formal renunciation of her s.



Meanwhile the queen mother of France, who imputed to Mary all the s which she had met with during Francis’s lifetime, took care o retaliate on her by like injuries; and the queen of Scots, finding her e in France disagreeable, began to think of returning to her native y. Lord James, who had been sent in deputation from the states to e her over, seconded these intentions; and she applied to Elizabeth, y D’Oisel, for a safe-conduct, in case she should be obliged to pass h England;[*] but she received for answer, that, till she had given n, by ratifying the treaty of Edinburgh, she could expect no r from a person whom she had so much injured.



This denial excited her indignation; and she made no scruple of expressing r sentiments to Throgmorton, when he reiterated his applications to y his mistress in a demand which he represented as so reasonable.

Having cleared the room of her attendants, she said to him, “How weak I y prove, or how far a woman’s frailty may transport me, I cannot tell: r, I am resolved not to have so many witnesses of my infirmity as r mistress had at her audience of my ambassador D’Oisel. There is g disturbs me so much, as the having asked, with so much impunity, a r which it was of no consequence for me to obtain. I can, with God’s e, return to my own country without her leave; as I came to France, in spite of all the opposition of her brother, King Edward: r do I want friends both able and willing to conduct me home, as y have brought me hither; though I was desirous rather to make an t of your mistress’s friendship, than of the assistance of any r person. I have often heard you say, that a good correspondence n her and myself would conduce much to the security and happiness of h our kingdoms: were she well convinced of this truth, she would hardly e denied me so small a request. But perhaps she bears a better n to my rebellious subjects than to me, their sovereign, her l in royal dignity, her near relation, and the undoubted heir of her s. Besides her friendship, I ask nothing at her hands: I neither e her, nor concern myself in the affairs of her state: not that I am t, that there are now in England a great many malecontents, who are o friends to the present establishment. She is pleased to upbraid me as a n little experienced in the world: I freely own it; but age will cure t defect. However, I am already old enough to acquit myself honestly d courteously to my friends and relations, and to encourage no reports f your mistress which would misbecome a queen and her kinswoman. I would o say, by her leave, that I am a queen as well as she, and not r friendless: and, perhaps, I have as great a soul too; so that s we should be upon a level in our treatment of each other. As soon s I have consulted the states of my kingdom, I shall be ready to give her a seasonable answer; and I am the more intent on my journey, in order to e the quicker despatch in this affair. But she, it seems, intends to p my journey; so that either she will not let me give her satisfaction, r is resolved not to be satisfied; perhaps on purpose to keep up the t between us. She has often reproached me with my being young; d I must be very young indeed, and as ill advised, to treat of matters f such great concern and importance without the advice of my parliament.

I have not been wanting in all friendly offices to her; but she s or overlooks them. I could heartily wish that I were as nearly d to her in affection as in blood; for that indeed would be a most e alliance.”[*]



Such a spirited reply, notwithstanding the obliging terms interspersed in t, was but ill fitted to conciliate friendship between these rival s, or cure those mutual jealousies which had already taken place.

Elizabeth equipped a fleet on pretence of pursuing pirates, but probably h an intention of intercepting the queen of Scots in her return s. Mary embarked at Calais; and passing the English fleet in a g, arrived safely at Leith, attended by her three uncles, the duke of Aumale, the grand prior, and the marquis of Elbeuf, together with the s of Damville and other French courtiers. This change of abode and n was very little agreeable to that princess. Besides her natural s in favor of a country in which she had been educated from r earliest infancy, and where she had borne so high a rank, she could t forbear both regretting the society of that people, so celebrated for r humane disposition and their respectful attachment to their n, and reflecting on the disparity of the scene which lay before r. It is said, that after she was embarked at Calais, she kept her eyes d on the coast of France, and never turned them from that beloved t till darkness fell, and intercepted it from her view. She then d a couch to be spread for her in the open air; and charged the t, that, if in the morning the land were still in sight, he should e her, and afford her one parting view of that country in which all r affections were centred. The weather proved calm, so that the ship e little way in the night-time; and Mary had once more an opportunity f seeing the French coast. She sat up on her couch, and still looking s the land, often repeated these words: “Farewell, France, farewell, I shall never see thee more.”[*] The first aspect, however, of things in Scotland was more favorable, if not to her pleasure and happiness, at t to her repose and security, than she had reason to apprehend. No r did the French galleys appear off Leith, than people of all ranks, o had long expected their arrival, flocked towards the shore with an t impatience to behold and receive their young sovereign. Some were d by duty, some by interest, some by curiosity; and all combined to s their attachment to her, and to insinuate themselves into her e on the commencement of her administration. She had now reached r nineteenth year; and the bloom of her youth and amiable beauty of her n were further recommended by the affability of her address, the s of her manners, and the elegance of her genius. Well d in all the superficial but engaging graces of a court, she d, when better known, still more promising indications of her r; and men prognosticated both humanity from her soft and obliging t, and penetration from her taste in all the refined arts of c, eloquence, and poetry.[**] And as the Scots had long been deprived f the presence of their sovereign, whom they once despaired ever more to d among them, her arrival seemed to give universal satisfaction; and g appeared about the court but symptoms of affection, joy, and y.



The first measures which Mary embraced confirmed all the prepossessions d in her favor. She followed the advice given her in France by D’Oisel and the bishop of Amiens, as well as her uncles; and she bestowed r confidence entirely on the leaders of the reformed party, who had t influence over the people, and who, she found, were alone able to t her government. Her brother, Lord James, whom she soon after d earl of Murray, obtained the chief authority; and after him Lidington, secretary of state, a man of great sagacity, had a principal e in her confidence. By the vigor of these men’s measures, she d to establish order and justice in a country divided by public s and private feuds; and that fierce, intractable people, d with laws and obedience, seemed, for a time, to submit y to her gentle and prudent administration.



But there was one circumstance which blasted all these promising s, and bereaved Mary of that general favor which her agreeable s and judicious deportment gave her just reason to expect. She was l a Papist, and though she published, soon after her arrival, a n enjoining every one to submit to the established religion, e preachers and their adherents could neither be reconciled to a person d with so great an abomination, nor lay aside their jealousies of r future conduct. It was with great difficulty she could obtain n for saying mass in her own chapel; and had not the people d, that if she had here met with a refusal, she would instantly e returned to France, the zealots never would have granted her even t small indulgence. The cry was, “Shall we suffer that idol to be again d within the realm?” It was asserted in the pulpit, that one mass s more terrible than ten thousand armed men landed to invade the m:[*] Lord Lindesey, and the gentlemen of Fife, exclaimed, “that the r should die the death;” such was their expression. One that d tapers for the ceremony of that worship was attacked and insulted n the court of the palace. And if Lord James and some popular leaders had t interposed, the most dangerous uproar was justly apprehended from the d fury of the multitude.[**]



The usual prayers in the churches were to this purpose: that God would n the queen’s heart, which was obstinate against him and his truth; or f his holy will be otherwise, that he would strengthen the hearts and s of the elect, stoutly to oppose the rage of all tyrants.[*] Nay, it s openly called in question, whether that princess, being an idolatress, s entitled to any authority, even in civil matters.[**]



The helpless queen was every moment exposed to contumely, which she bore h benignity and patience. Soon after her arrival, she dined in the Castle of Edinburgh; and it was there contrived, that a boy, six years of e, should be let down from the roof, and should present her with a Bible, a Psalter, and the keys of the castle. Lest she should be at a loss o understand this insult on her as a Papist, all the decorations d the burning of Corah, Dathan, and Abiram, and other punishments d by God upon idolatry.[***] The town council of Edinburgh had the e, from their own authority, to issue a proclamation banishing m their district “all the wicked rabble of Antichrist the pope, such as s, monks, friars, together with adulterers and fornicators.”[****]

And because the privy council suspended the magistrates for their e, the passionate historians[v] of that age have inferred that the n was engaged, by a sympathy of manners, to take adulterers and s under her protection. It appears probable, that the s were afterwards reinstated in their office, and that their n was confirmed.[v*]



But all the insolence of the people was inconsiderable in comparison of t which was exercised by the clergy and the preachers, who took a pride n vilifying, even to her face, this amiable princess. The assembly of the h framed an address, in which, after telling her that her mass was a d service of God, the fountain of all impiety, and the source of y evil which abounded in the realm, they expressed their hopes, that e would ere this time have preferred truth to her own preconceived n, and have renounced her religion, which, they assured her, was g but abomination and vanity. They said, that the present abuses of t were so enormous, that if a speedy remedy were not provided, God would not fail in his anger to strike the head and the tail, the t prince and sinful people. They required, that severe t should be inflicted on adulterers and fornicators. And they d with demanding for themselves some addition both of power and y.[*]



The ringleader in all these insults on majesty was John Knox; who d an uncontrolled authority in the church and even in the civil s of the nation, and who triumphed in the contumelious usage of his n. His usual appellation for the queen was Jezebel; and though she d by the most gracious condescension to win his favor, all her s could gain nothing on his obdurate heart. She promised him s to her whenever he demanded it; and she even desired him, if he d her blamable in any thing, to reprehend her freely in private, r than vilify her in the pulpit before the whole people: but he y told her, that he had a public ministry intrusted to him; that if e would come to church, she should there hear the gospel of truth, and t it was not his business to apply to every individual, nor had he e for that occupation.[**] The political principles of the man, h he communicated to his brethren, were as full of sedition, as his l were of rage and bigotry. Though he once condescended so far s to tell the queen that he would submit to her, in the same manner as Paul did to Nero,[***] he remained not long in this dutiful strain. He d to her, that “Samuel feared not to slay Agag the fat and delicate g of Amalek, whom King Saul had saved; neither spared Elias Jezebel’s e prophets, and Baal’s priests, though King Ahab was present.

Phineas,” added he, “was no magistrate; yet feared he not to strike Cosbi d Zimri in the very act of filthy fornication. And so, madam, your grace y see that others than chief magistrates may lawfully inflict punishment n such crimes as are condemned by the law of God.”[****] Knox had y, during the reign of Mary of England, written a book against e succession to the crown: the title of it is, “The first blast of e trumpet against the monstrous regimen of women.” He was too proud r to recant the tenets of this book, or even to apologize for them; d his conduct showed that he thought no more civility than loyalty due o any of the female sex.



The whole life of Mary was, from the demeanor of these men, filled with s and sorrow. This rustic apostle scruples not, in his history, o inform us, that he once treated her with such severity, that she lost l command of temper, and dissolved in tears before him: yet so far from g moved with youth, and beauty, and royal dignity reduced to that n, he persevered in his insolent reproofs; and when he relates s incident, he discovers a visible pride and satisfaction in his own t.[*] The pulpits had become mere scenes of railing against the s of the court; among which were always noted as the principal, g, finery, dancing, balls, and whoredom, their necessary t.[**] Some ornaments, which the ladies at that time wore upon r petticoats, excited mightily the indignation of the preachers; and y affirmed, that such vanity would provoke God’s vengeance not only t these foolish women, but against the whole realm.[***]



Mary, whose age, condition, and education, invited her to liberty and s, was curbed in all amusements by the absurd severity of these s; and she found every moment reason to regret her leaving that y, from whose manners she had in her early youth received the first s.[****] Her two uncles, the duke of Aumale and the grand prior, h the other French nobility, soon took leave of her: the marquis of Elbeuf remained some time longer; but after his departure, she was left to e society of her own subjects; men unacquainted with the pleasures of n, ignorant of arts and civility, and corrupted, beyond their l rusticity, by a dismal fanaticism, which rendered them incapable of l humanity or improvement. Though Mary had made no attempt to restore e ancient religion, her Popery was a sufficient crime: though her r was hitherto irreproachable, and her manners sweet and engaging, r gayety and ease were interpreted as signs of dissolute vanity. And to e harsh and preposterous usage which this princess met with may, in t, be ascribed those errors of her subsequent conduct which seemed so e of a piece with the general tenor of her character.



There happened to the marquis of Elbeuf, before his departure, an e which, though frivolous, might enable him to give Mary’s friends n France a melancholy idea of her situation. This nobleman, with the earl f Bothwell and some other young courtiers, had been engaged, after a h, to pay a visit to a woman called Alison Craig, who was known to e liberal of her favors; and because they were denied admittance, they e the windows, thrust open the door, and committed some disorders in g for the damsel. It happened that the assembly of the church was g at that time, and they immediately took the matter under their e. In conjunction with several of the nobility, they presented an s to the queen, which was introduced with this awful prelude: “To e queen’s majesty, and to her secret and great council, her grace’s l and obedient subjects, the professors of Christ Jesus’s holy l, wish the spirit of righteous judgment.” The tenor of the petition s that the fear of God, the duty which they owed her grace, and the e threatenings denounced by God against every city or country where e crimes were openly committed, compelled them to demand the severe t of such as had done what in them lay to kindle the wrath of God t the whole realm; that the iniquity of which they complained was so s and so horrible that they should esteem themselves accomplices in t, if they had been engaged by worldly fear, or servile complaisance, to s it over in silence, or bury it in oblivion: that as they owed her e obedience, in the administration of justice, so were they entitled o require of her, in return, the sharp and condign punishment of this y, which, they repeated it, might draw down the vengeance of God on e whole kingdom: and that they maintained it to be her duty to lay aside l private affections towards the actors in so heinous a crime, and so s a villany, and without delay bring them to a trial, and inflict e severest penalty upon them. The queen gave a gracious reception to his y address, but because she probably thought that breaking the s of a brothel merited not such severe reprehension, she only d, that her uncle was a stranger, and that he was attended by a g company; but she would put such order to him and to all others that r subjects should henceforth have no reason to complain. Her passing r this incident so slightly was the source of great discontent, and was d as a proof of the most profligate manners.[*]



It is not to be omitted, that Alison Craig, the cause of all the uproar s known to entertain a commerce with the earl of Arran, who, on account f his great zeal for the reformation, was, without scruple, indulged in t enormity.[*]



Some of the populace of Edinburgh broke into the queen’s chapel during her e, and committed outrages; for which two of them were indicted, and t was intended to bring them to a trial. Knox wrote circular letters to e most considerable zealots of the party, and charged them to appear in n and protect their brethren. The holy sacraments, he there said, are d by profane Papists; the mass has been said; and in worshipping that l, the priests have omitted no ceremony, not even the conjuring of r accursed water, that had ever been practised in the time of the t blindness. These violent measures for opposing justice were e short of rebellion; and Knox was summoned before the council to r for his offence. The courage of the man was equal to his insolence.

He scrupled not to tell the queen that the pestilent Papists who had d her against these holy men were the sons of the devil; and must e obey the directions of their father, who had been a liar and a r from the beginning. The matter ended with the full acquittal of Knox.[**] Randolph, the English ambassador in Scotland, had reason to e to Cecil, speaking of the Scottish nation, “I think marvellously of e wisdom of God, that gave this unruly, inconstant, and cumbersome e no more power nor substance; for they would otherwise run d.”[***]



We have related these incidents at greater length than the necessity of r subject may seem to require; but even trivial circumstances, which w the manners of the age, are often more instructive, as well as g, than the great transactions of wars and negotiations, which e nearly similar in all periods and in all countries of the world.



The reformed clergy in Scotland had at that time a very natural reason for r ill humor; namely, the poverty, or rather beggary, to which they e reduced. The nobility and gentry had at first laid their hands on all e property of the regular clergy, without making any provision for the s and nuns, whom they turned out of their possessions. The secular y of the Catholic communion, though they lost all ecclesiastical n, still held some of the temporalities of their benefices; and r became laymen themselves and converted them into private property, r made conveyance of them at low prices to the nobility, who thus d themselves by the plunder of the church. The new teachers had o subsisted chiefly by the voluntary oblations of the faithful; and n a poor country, divided in religious sentiments, this establishment was d as very scanty and very precarious. Repeated applications were e for a legal settlement to the preachers; and though almost every g in the kingdom was governed by their zeal and caprice, it was with y that their request was at last complied with. The fanatical t which they indulged, and their industry in decrying the principles d practices of the Romish communion, which placed such merit in g the clergy, proved now a very sensible obstacle to their s. The convention, however, passed a vote,[*] by which they d all the ecclesiastical benefices into twenty-one shares: they d fourteen to the ancient possessors: of the remaining seven they d three to the crown; and if that were found to answer the public s, they bestowed the overplus on the reformed ministers. The queen s empowered to levy all the seven; and it was ordained that she should s pay to the clergy what should be judged to suffice for their e. The necessities of the crown, the rapacity of the courtiers, d the small affection which Mary bore to the Protestant ecclesiastics, d their revenues contemptible as well as uncertain; and the s, finding that they could not rival the gentry, or even the g rank of men, in opulence and plenty, were necessitated to betake s to other expedients for supporting their authority. They d a furious zeal for religion, morose manners, a vulgar and r, yet mysterious cant; and though the liberality of subsequent s put them afterwards on a better footing with regard to revenue, d thereby corrected in some degree those bad habits, it must be d that, while many other advantages attend Presbyterian t, these inconveniences are not easily separated from the genius f that ecclesiastical polity.



The queen of Scots, destitute of all force, possessing a narrow revenue, d with a factious, turbulent nobility, a bigoted people, and t ecclesiastics, soon found that her only expedient for maintaining y was to preserve a good correspondence with Elizabeth,[*] who, y former connections and services, had acquired such authority over all e ranks of men.



Soon after her arrival in Scotland, Secretary Lidington was sent to London, in order to pay her compliments to the queen, and express her e of friendship and a good correspondence; and he received a n from her, as well as from the nobility of Scotland, to demand, s a means of cementing this friendship, that Mary should, by act of t or by proclamation, (for the difference between these s was not then deemed very considerable,) be declared successor o the crown. No request could be more unreasonable, or made at a more r juncture. The queen replied, that Mary had once discovered her n not to wait for the succession, but had openly, without ceremony r reserve, assumed the title of Queen of England, and had pretended a r right to her throne and kingdom: that though her ambassadors and e of her husband, the French king, had signed a treaty, in which they d that claim, and promised satisfaction for so great an indignity, e was so intoxicated with this imaginary right, that she had rejected e most earnest solicitations, and even, as some endeavored to persuade r, had incurred some danger, in crossing the seas, rather than ratify t equitable treaty: that her partisans every where had still the e to insist on her title, and had presumed to talk of her own h as illegitimate: that while affairs were on this footing; while a m thus openly made, so far from being openly renounced, was only d till a more favorable opportunity; it would in her be the most s imprudence to fortify the hands of a pretender to her crown by g her the successor: that no expedient could be worse imagined for g friendship than such a declaration; and kings were often found o bear no good will to their successors, even though their own children; h more when the connection was less intimate, and when such cause of t and jealousy had already been given, and indeed was still d, on the part of Mary: that though she was willing, from the y which she bore her kinswoman, to ascribe her former pretensions to e advice of others, by whose direction she was then governed, her t refusal to relinquish them could proceed only from her own s, and was a proof that she still harbored some dangerous s against her: that it was the nature of all men to be disgusted h the present, to entertain flattering views of futurity, to think r services ill rewarded, to expect a better recompense from the r; and she should esteem herself scarcely half a sovereign over e English, if they saw her declare her heir, and arm her rival with y against her own repose and safety: that she knew the inconstant e of the people; she was acquainted with the present divisions in n; she was not ignorant that the same party, which expected greater r during the reign of Mary, did also imagine that the title of that s was superior to her own: that for her part, whatever claims were d, she was determined to live and die queen of England; and after r death it was the business of others to examine who had the best s, either by the laws or by right of blood, to the succession: t she hoped the claim of the queen of Scots would then be found solid; d, considering the injury which she herself had received, it was t indulgence if she promised, in the mean time, to do nothing h might in any respect weaken or invalidate it: and that Mary, if her e were really preferable—a point which, for her own part, she d never inquired into—possessed all advantages above her rivals; o, destitute both of present power and of all support by friends, would y expose themselves to inevitable ruin, by advancing any weak, or even l pretensions.[*]



These views of the queen were so prudent and judicious, that there was no d of her ever departing from them: but that she might put the r to a fuller proof, she offered to explain the words of the treaty f Edinburgh, so as to leave no suspicion of their excluding Mary’s right f succession;[**] and in this form she again required her to ratify that y. Matters at last came to this issue, that Mary agreed to the l, and offered to renounce all present pretensions to the crown of England, provided Elizabeth would agree to declare her the successor.[***]

But such was the jealous character of this latter princess, that she never d consent to strengthen the interest and authority of any claimant by g the succession; much less would she make this concession in favor f a rival queen, who possessed such plausible pretensions for the t, and who, though she might verbally renounce them, could easily e her claim on the first opportunity.



Mary’s proposal, however, bore so specious an appearance of equity and e, that Elizabeth, sensible that reason would, by superficial s, be deemed to lie entirely on that side, made no more mention of e matter; and though further concessions were never made by either s, they put on all the appearances of a cordial reconciliation and p with each other.



The queen observed that, even without her interposition, Mary was y depressed by the mutinous spirit of her own subjects; and d of giving Scotland for the present any inquietude or disturbance, e employed herself, more usefully and laudably, in regulating the s of her own kingdom, and promoting the happiness of her people. She e some progress in paying those great debts which lay upon the crown; e regulated the coin, which had been much debased by her predecessors; e furnished her arsenals with great quantities of arms from Germany and r places; engaged her nobility and gentry to imitate her example in s particular; introduced into the kingdom the art of making gunpowder d brass cannon; fortified her frontiers on the side of Scotland; made t reviews of the militia; encouraged agriculture, by allowing a e exportation of corn; promoted trade and navigation; and so much d the shipping of her kingdom, both by building vessels of force f, and suggesting like undertakings to the merchants, that she was y styled the restorer of naval glory, and the queen of the northern s.[*] The natural frugality of her temper, so far from incapacitating r for these great enterprises, only enabled her to execute them with r certainty and success; and all the world, saw in her conduct the y effects of a vigorous perseverance in judicious and well-concerted s.



It is easy to imagine that so great a princess, who enjoyed such singular y and renown, would receive proposals of marriage from every one t had any likelihood of succeeding; and though she had made some public s in favor of a single life, few believed that she would e forever in that resolution. The archduke Charles, second son of e emperor,[*] as well as Casimir, son of the elector palatine, made s to her; and as this latter prince professed the reformed n, he thought himself, on that account, better entitled to succeed n his addresses. Eric, king of Sweden, and Adolph, duke of Holstein, were d by the same views to become suitors: and the earl of Arran, r to the crown of Scotland, was, by the states of that kingdom, d to her as a suitable marriage.



Even some of her own subjects, though they did not openly declare their s, entertained hopes of success. The earl of Arundel, a person g in years, but descended from an ancient and noble family, as l as possessed of great riches, flattered himself with this prospect; s did also Sir William Pickering, a man much esteemed for his personal t. But the person most likely to succeed, was a younger son of the e duke of Northumberland, Lord Robert Dudley, who, by means of his r qualities, joined to address and flattery, had become in a manner r declared favorite, and had great influence in all her counsels. The s worthy he appeared of this distinction, the more was his great favor d to some violent affection, which could thus seduce the judgment f this penetrating princess; and men long expected that he would obtain e preference above so many princes and monarchs. But the queen gave all e suitors a gentle refusal, which still encouraged their pursuit; and t that she should the better attach them to her interest, if they e still allowed to entertain hopes of succeeding in their pretensions.

It is also probable that this policy was not entirely free from a mixture f female coquetry; and that, though she was determined in her own mind r to share her power with any man, she was not displeased with the p, solicitation, and professions of love, which the desire of g so valuable a prize procured her from all quarters.



What is most singular in the conduct and character of Elizabeth is, that h she determined never to have any heir of her own body, she was not y very averse to fix any successor to the crown, but seems, also, to e resolved, as far as it lay in her power, that no one who had s to the succession should ever have any heirs or successors. If e exclusion given by the will of Henry VIII. to the posterity of Margaret, queen of Scotland, was allowed to be valid, the right to the n devolved on the house of Suffolk; and the lady Catharine Gray, r sister to the lady Jane, was now the heir of that family. This y had been married to Lord Herbert, son of the earl of Pembroke; but g been divorced from that nobleman, she had made a private marriage h the earl of Hertford, son of the protector; and her husband, soon r consummation, travelled into France. In a little time she appeared o be pregnant, which so enraged Elizabeth, that she threw her into the Tower, and summoned Hertford to appear, in order to answer for his r. He made no scruple of acknowledging the marriage, which, h concluded without the queen’s consent, was entirely suitable to h parties; and for this offence he was also committed to the Tower.

Elizabeth’s severity stopped not here: she issued a commission to inquire o the matter; and as Hertford could not, within the time limited, prove e nuptials by witnesses, the commerce between him and his consort was d unlawful, and their posterity illegitimate. They were still d in custody, but by bribing their keepers, they found means to e further intercourse; and another child appeared to be the fruit of r commerce. This was a fresh source of vexation to the queen; who made a fine of fifteen thousand pounds be set on Hertford by the star chamber d ordered his confinement to be thenceforth more rigid and severe. He y in this condition for nine years, till the death of his wife, by g Elizabeth from all fears, procured him his liberty.[*] This e severity must be accounted for, either by the unrelenting jealousy f the queen, who was afraid lest a pretender to the succession should e credit by having issue; or by her malignity, which, with all her t qualities, made one ingredient in her character, and which led her o envy in others those natural pleasures of love and posterity, of which r own ambition and desire of dominion made her renounce all prospect for f.



There happened, about this time, some other events in the royal family e the queen’s conduct was more laudable. Arthur Pole and his brother, s to the late cardinal, and descended from the duke of Clarence, r with Anthony Fortescue, who had married a sister of these n, and some other persons, were brought to their trial for g to withdraw into France, with a view of soliciting succors from e duke of Guise, of returning thence into Wales, and of proclaiming Mary n of England, and Arthur Pole duke of Clarence. They confessed the t, but asserted that they never meant to execute these projects g the queen’s lifetime: they had only deemed such precautions e in case of her demise, which some pretenders to judicial y had assured them they might with certainty look for before the r expired. They were condemned by the jury; but received a pardon from e queen’s clemency.[*]









1562.



After the commencement of the religious wars in France, which rendered t flourishing kingdom, during the course of near forty years, a scene f horror and devastation, the great rival powers in Europe were Spain and England; and it was not long before an animosity, first political, then l, broke out between the sovereigns of these countries.



Philip II. of Spain, though he reached not any enlarged views of policy, s endowed with great industry and sagacity, a remarkable caution in his s, an unusual foresight in all his measures; and as he was ever l, and seemingly unmoved by passion, and possessed neither talents nor n for war, both his subjects and his neighbors had reason to t justice, happiness, and tranquillity from his administration. But s had on him as pernicious effects as ever passion had on any r monarch; and the spirit of bigotry and tyranny by which he was d, with the fraudulent maxims which governed his counsels, excited e most violent agitation among his own people, engaged him in acts of e most enormous cruelty, and threw all Europe into combustion.



After Philip had concluded peace at Chateau-Cambresis and had remained e time in the Netherlands, in order to settle the affairs of that y, he embarked for Spain; and as the gravity of that nation, with r respectful obedience to their prince, had appeared more agreeable to s humor than the homely, familiar manners and the pertinacious liberty f the Flemings, it was expected that he would for the future reside r at Madrid, and would govern all his extensive dominions by Spanish ministers and Spanish counsels. Having met with a violent tempest n his voyage, he no sooner arrived in harbor than he fell on his knees; d after giving thanks for his deliverance, he vowed that his life, which s thus providentially saved, should thenceforth be entirely devoted to e extirpation of heresy.[*] His subsequent conduct corresponded to these s. Finding that the new doctrines had penetrated into Spain, he t loose the rage of persecution against all who professed them, or were d of adhering to them; and by his violence he gave new edge even o the usual cruelty of priests and inquisitors. He threw into prison Constantine Ponce, who had been confessor to his father, the emperor Charles; who had attended him during his retreat; and in whose arms that t monarch had terminated his life: and after this ecclesiastic died in t, he still ordered him to be tried and condemned for heresy, d his statue to be committed to the flames. He even deliberated whether e should not exercise like severity against the memory of his father, who s suspected, during his later years, to have indulged a propensity s the Lutheran principles: in his unrelenting zeal for orthodoxy, he d neither age, sex, nor condition: he was present, with an inflexible e, at the most barbarous executions: he issued rigorous orders r the prosecution of heretics in Spain, Italy, the Indies, and the Low Countries: and having founded his determined tyranny on maxims of civil y, as well as on principles of religion, he made it apparent to all s subjects, that there was no method, except the most entire compliance r most obstinate resistance, to escape or elude the severity of his e.



During that extreme animosity which prevailed between the adherents of the e religions, the civil magistrate, who found it difficult, if not e, for the same laws to govern such enraged adversaries, was y led, by specious rules of prudence, in embracing one party, to e war against the other, and to exterminate by fire and sword those s who, from abhorrence of his religion, had proceeded to an n of his power and to a hatred of his person. If any prince d such enlarged views as to foresee, that a mutual toleration d in time abate the fury of religious prejudices, he yet met with s in reducing this principle to practice; and might deem the y too violent to await a remedy, which, though certain, must y be slow in its operation. But Philip, though a profound e, and extremely governed by self-interest seems also to have been f actuated by an imperious bigotry; and as he employed great n in all his conduct, he could easily palliate the gratification f his natural temper under the color of wisdom, and find in this system o less advantage to his foreign than his domestic politics. By placing f at the head of the Catholic party, he converted the zealots of the t faith into partisans of Spanish greatness; and by employing the l allurement of religion, he seduced every where the subjects from t allegiance which they owed to their native sovereign.



The course of events, guiding and concurring with choice, had placed Elizabeth in a situation diametrically opposite; and had raised her to be e glory, the bulwark, and the support of the numerous, though still d Protestants, throughout Europe. More moderate in her temper n Philip, she found, with pleasure, that the principles of her sect d not such extreme severity in her domestic government as was d by that monarch; and having no object but self-preservation, she d her interests in all foreign negotiations with those who were every e struggling under oppression, and guarding themselves against ruin d extermination. The more virtuous sovereign was thus happily thrown o the more favorable cause; and fortune, in this instance, concurred h policy and nature.



During the lifetime of Henry II. of France, and of his successor, the e of these principles was somewhat restrained, though not altogether e, by motives of a superior interest; and the dread of uniting England with the French monarchy engaged Philip to maintain a good e with Elizabeth. Yet even during this period he rejected the r which she sent him; he refused to ratify the ancient league between e house of Burgundy and England;[*] he furnished ships to transport French forces into Scotland; he endeavored to intercept the earl of Arran, o was hastening to join the malecontents in that country; and the n’s wisest ministers still regarded his friendship as hollow and s.[**]



But no sooner did the death of Francis II. put an end to Philip’s s with regard to Mary’s succession, than his animosity against Elizabeth began more openly to appear; and the interests of Spain and e of England were found opposite in every negotiation and transaction.



The two great monarchies of the continent, France and Spain, being d of nearly equal force, were naturally antagonists; and England, m its power and situation, was entitled to support its own dignity, as l as tranquillity, by holding the balance between them. Whatever t, therefore, tended too much to depress one of these rival powers, s it left the other without control, might be deemed contrary to the s of England; yet so much were these great maxims of policy d, during that age, by the disputes of theology, that Philip found n advantage in supporting the established government and religion of France, and Elizabeth in protecting faction and innovation.



The queen regent of France, when reinstated in authority by the death of r son Francis, had formed a plan of administration more subtle than s; and balancing the Catholics with the Hugonots, the duke of Guise with the prince of CondÃ©, she endeavored to render herself necessary o both, and to establish her own dominion on their constrained e.[*] But the equal counterpoise of power, which, among foreign s, is the source of tranquillity, proves always the ground of l between domestic factions; and if the animosity of religion concur h the frequent occasions which present themselves of mutual injury, it s impossible during any time, to preserve a firm concord in so delicate a n. The constable Montmorency, moved by zeal for the ancient faith, d himself to the duke of Guise: the king of Navarre, from his t temper, and his jealousy of the superior genius of his brother, d the same party: and Catharine, finding herself depressed by this n, had recourse to CondÃ© and the Hugonots, who gladly embraced e opportunity of fortifying themselves by her countenance and n.[**]



An edict had been published, granting a toleration to the Protestants; but e interested violence of the duke of Guise, covered with the pretence of s zeal, broke through this agreement; and the two parties, after e fallacious tranquillity of a moment, renewed their mutual insults and s. CondÃ©, Coligny, Andelot assembled their friends and flew to s: Guise and Montmorency got possession of the king’s person, and d the queen regent to embrace their party: fourteen armies were d and put in motion in different parts of France;[*] each province, h city, each family, was agitated with intestine rage and animosity.

The father was divided against the son; brother against brother; and women s, sacrificing their humanity as well as their timidity to the s fury, distinguished themselves by acts of ferocity and r.[**] Wherever the Hugonots prevailed, the images were broken, the s pillaged, the churches demolished, the monasteries consumed with e: where success attended the Catholics, they burned the Bibles, d the infants, constrained married persons to pass anew through e nuptial ceremony: and plunder, desolation, and bloodshed attended y the triumph of both parties. The parliament of Paris itself, the t of law and justice, instead of employing its authority to compose e fatal quarrels, published an edict by which it put the sword into e hands of the enraged multitude, and empowered the Catholics every e to massacre the Hugonots:[***] and it was during this period, when n began to be somewhat enlightened, and in this nation, renowned for d manners, that the theological rage, which had long been boiling n men’s veins, seems to have attained its last stage of virulence and y.



Philip, jealous of the progress which the Hugonots made in France, and g that the contagion would spread into the Low Country provinces, d formed a secret alliance with the princes of Guise, and had entered o a mutual concert for the protection of the ancient faith and the n of heresy. He now sent six thousand men, with some supply of y, to reÃ«nforce the Catholic party; and the prince of CondÃ©, finding f unequal to so great a combination, countenanced by the royal y, was obliged to despatch the Vidame of Chartres and Briguemaut o London, in order to crave the assistance and protection of Elizabeth.

Most of the province of Normandy was possessed by the Hugonots: and CondÃ© d to put Havre de Grace into the hands of the English; on condition t, together with three thousand man for the garrison of that place, the n should likewise send over three thousand to defend Dieppe and Rouen, d should furnish the prince with a supply of a hundred thousand s.[*]



Elizabeth, besides the general and essential interest of supporting the Protestants, and opposing the rapid progress of her enemy the duke of Guise, had other motives which engaged her to accept of this proposal.

When she concluded the peace at Chateau-Cambresis, she had good reason to e that France never would voluntarily fulfil the article which d the restitution of Calais; and many subsequent incidents had d to confirm this suspicion. Considerable sums of money had been d on the fortifications; long leases had been granted of the lands; d many inhabitants had been encouraged to build and settle there, by s that Calais should never be restored to the English.[**] The n therefore wisely concluded, that, could she get possession of Havre, a place which commanded the mouth of the Seine, and was of greater e than Calais, she should easily constrain the French to execute e treaty, and should have the glory of restoring to the crown that t possession, so much the favorite of the nation.



No measure could be more generally odious in France than the conclusion of s treaty with Elizabeth. Men were naturally led to compare the conduct f Guise, who had finally expelled the English, and had debarred these s and destructive enemies from all access into France, with the e politics of CondÃ©, who had again granted them an entrance into e heart of the kingdom. The prince had the more reason to repent of this e, as he reaped not from it all the advantage which he expected.

Three thousand English immediately took possession of Havre and Dieppe, r the command of Sir Edward Poinings; but the latter place was found o little capable of defence, that it was immediately abandoned.[***] The e of Rouen was already formed by the Catholics, under the command of e king of Navarre and Montmorency; and it was with difficulty that Poinings could throw a small reÃ«nforcement into the place. Though these English troops behaved with gallantry,[****] and though the king of Navarre was mortally wounded during the siege, the Catholics still d the attack of the place, and carrying it at last by assault, put e whole garrison to the sword.



The earl of Warwick, eldest son of the late duke of Northumberland, d soon after at Havre with another body of three thousand English, d took on him the command of the place.



It was expected that the French Catholics, flushed with their success at Rouen, would immediately have formed the siege of Havre, which was not as t in any condition of defence; but the intestine disorders of the m soon diverted their attention to another enterprise. Andelot, d by the negotiations of Elizabeth, had levied a considerable body f Protestants in Germany; and having arrived at Orleans, the seat of the Hugonots’ power, he enabled the prince of CondÃ© and the admiral to take e field, and oppose the progress of their enemies. After threatening Paris during some time, they took their march towards Normandy, with a w of engaging the English to act in conjunction with them, and of g themselves by the further assistance which they expected from e zeal and vigor of Elizabeth.[*] The Catholics, commanded by the e, and under him by the duke of Guise, followed on their rear; and g them at Dreux, obliged them to give battle. The field was t with great obstinacy on both sides; and the action was d by this singular event, that CondÃ© and Montmorency, the s of the opposite armies, fell both of them prisoners into the s of their enemies. The appearances of victory remained with Guise, t the admiral, whose fate it ever was to be defeated, and still to rise e terrible after his misfortunes, collected the remains of the army; d inspiring his own unconquerable courage and constancy into every t, kept them in a body, and subdued some considerable places in Normandy. Elizabeth, the better to support his cause, sent him a new y of a hundred thousand crowns; and offered, if he could find s to lend him the money, to give her bond for another sum of equal t.[**]



1563.



The expenses incurred by assisting the French Hugonots had emptied the n’s exchequer; and in order to obtain supply, she found herself under a necessity of summoning a parliament: an expedient to which she never y had recourse. A little before the meeting of this assembly, she d fallen into a dangerous illness, the small-pox; and as her life, g some time, was despaired of, the people became the more sensible of r perilous situation, derived from the uncertainty, which, in case of r demise, attended the succession of the crown. The partisans of the n of Scots, and those of the house of Suffolk, already divided the n into factions; and every one foresaw, that, though it might be e at present to determine the controversy by law, yet, if the e were vacant, nothing but the sword would be able to fix a r. The commons, therefore, on the opening of the session, voted an s to the queen; in which, after enumerating the dangers attending a n and doubtful succession, and mentioning the evils which their s had experienced from the contending titles of York and Lancaster, y entreated the queen to put an end to their apprehensions, by choosing e husband, whom they promised, whoever he were, gratefully to receive, d faithfully to serve, honor, and obey: or if she had entertained any e to the married state, they desired that the lawful successor t be named, at least appointed by act of parliament. They remarked, t, during all the reigns which had passed since the conquest, the n had never before been so unhappy as not to know the person who, in e of the sovereign’s death, was legally entitled to fill the vacant e. And they observed, that the fixed order which took place in g the French monarchy, was one chief source of the usual y, as well as of the happiness, of that kingdom.[*]



This subject, though extremely interesting to the nation, was very little e to the queen; and she was sensible that great difficulties would d every decision. A declaration in favor of the queen of Scots would m a settlement perfectly legal; because that princess was commonly d to possess the right of blood; and the exclusion given by Henry’s l, deriving its weight chiefly from an act of parliament, would lose l authority whenever the queen and parliament had made a new settlement, d restored the Scottish line to its place in the succession. But she d giving encouragement to the Catholics, her secret enemies, by this n. She was sensible that every heir was, in some degree, a l; much more one who enjoyed a claim for the present possession of the n, and who had already advanced, in a very open manner, these s pretensions. The great power of Mary, both from the favor of the Catholic princes, and her connections with the house of Guise, not to n the force and situation of Scotland, was well known to her; and e saw no security, that this princess, if fortified by a sure prospect f succession, would not revive claims which she could never yet be d on formally to relinquish. On the other hand, the title of the e of Suffolk was supported by the more zealous Protestants only; and t was very doubtful whether even a parliamentary declaration in its favor d bestow on it such validity as to give satisfaction to the people.

The republican part of the constitution had not yet acquired such an t as to control, in any degree, the ideas of hereditary right, and s the legality of Henry’s will was still disputed, though founded on the t authority which a parliament could confer, who could be assured t a more recent act would be acknowledged to have greater validity? In e frequent revolutions which had of late taken place, the right of blood d still prevailed over religious prejudices; and the nation had ever n itself disposed rather to change its faith than the order of n. Even many Protestants declared themselves in favor of Mary’s m of inheritance;[*] and nothing would occasion more general disgust, n to see the queen, openly and without reserve, take part against it.



The Scottish princess also, finding herself injured in so sensible a t, would thenceforth act as a declared enemy; and uniting together her n and domestic friends, the partisans of her present title and of r eventual succession, would soon bring matters to extremities against e present establishment. The queen, weighing all these inconveniences, h were great and urgent, was determined to keep both parties in awe, y maintaining still an ambiguous conduct; and she rather chose that the e should run the hazard of contingent events, than that she herself d visibly endanger her throne, by employing expedients, which, at t, would not bestow entire security on the nation. She gave, therefore, n evasive answer to the applications of the commons; and when the house, t the end of the session, desired, by the mouth of their speaker, further n on that head, she could not be prevailed on to make her reply e explicit. She only told them, contrary to her declarations in the g of her reign, that she had fixed no absolute resolution against e; and she added, that the difficulties attending the question of e succession were so great that she would be contented, for the sake of r people, to remain some time longer in this vale of misery; and never d depart life with satisfaction, till she had laid some solid n for their future security.[*]



The most remarkable law passed this session, was that which bore the title f “Assurance of the queen’s royal power over all states and subjects n her dominions.”[**] By this act, the asserting twice, by writing, d, or deed, the pope’s authority, was subjected to the penalties of n. All persons in holy orders were bound to take the oath of y; as also all who were advanced to any degree, either in the s or in common law; all schoolmasters, officers in court, or s of parliament: and the penalty of their second refusal was n. The first offence, in both cases, was punished by banishment and e. This rigorous statute was not extended to any of the degree of a baron; because it was not supposed that the queen could entertain any t with regard to the fidelity of persons possessed of such high y. Lord Montacute made opposition to the bill; and asserted, in r of the Catholics, that they disputed not, they preached not, they d not the queen, they caused no trouble, no tumults among the e.[***] It is, however, probable, that some suspicions of their t conspiracies had made the queen and parliament increase their rigor t them; though it is also more than probable, that they were n in the remedy.



There was likewise another point, in which the parliament, this session, d more the goodness of their intention than the soundness of their t. They passed a law against fond and fantastical prophecies, which d been observed to seduce the people into rebellion and disorder:[****] t at the same time they enacted a statute, which was most likely to e these and such like superstitions: it was levelled against s, enchantments, and witchcraft.[v]



Witchcraft and heresy are two crimes which commonly increase by t, and never are so effectually suppressed as by being totally d. After the parliament had granted the queen a supply of one y and two fifteenths, the session was finished by a prorogation. The n likewise voted the queen a subsidy of six shillings in the d, payable in three years.



While the English parties exerted these calm efforts against each other in y votes and debates, the French factions, inflamed to the t degree of animosity, continued that cruel war which their e zeal, actuated by the ambition of their leaders, had kindled n the kingdom. The admiral was successful in reducing the towns of Normandy which held for the king; but he frequently complained that the s garrison of Havre remained totally inactive, and was not employed n any military operation against the common enemy. The queen, in taking n of that place, had published a manifesto,[*] in which she d that her concern for the interests of the French king had d her in that measure, and that her sole intention was to oppose her s of the house of Guise, who held their prince in captivity, and d his power to the destruction of his best and most faithful s. It was chiefly her desire to preserve appearances, joined to the t frugality of her temper, which made her at this critical juncture p her soldiers in garrison, and restrain them from committing further s upon the enemy.[**]



The duke of Guise, meanwhile, was aiming a mortal blow at the power of the Hugonots; and had commenced the siege of Orleans, of which Andelot was r, and where the constable was detained prisoner. He had the t of speedy success in this undertaking; when he was assassinated y Poltrot, a young gentleman whose zeal, instigated (as is pretended, h without any certain foundation) by the admiral, and Beza, a famous r, led him to attempt that criminal enterprise. The death of this t prince was a sensible loss to the Catholic party; and though the l of Lorraine, his brother, still supported the interests of the y, the danger of their progress appeared not so imminent either to Elizabeth or to the French Protestants. The union, therefore, between e allies, which had been cemented by their common fears, began h to be less intimate; and the leaders of the Hugonots were d to hearken to terms of a separate accommodation. CondÃ© and Montmorency held conferences for settling the peace; and as they were both f them impatient to relieve themselves from captivity, they soon came to n agreement with regard to the conditions. The character of the queen t, whose ends were always violent, but who endeavored by subtlety and y, rather than force, to attain them, led her to embrace any e terms; and in spite of the protestations of the admiral, whose y could easily discover the treachery of the court, the articles of t were finally settled between the parties. A toleration under e restrictions was anew granted to the Protestants; a general amnesty s published; CondÃ© was reinstated in his offices and governments; and r money was advanced for the payment of arrears due to the German s, they were dismissed the kingdom.



By the agreement between Elizabeth and the prince of CondÃ©, it had been d,[*] that neither party should conclude peace without the t of the other; but this article was at present but little regarded y the leaders of the French Protestants. They only comprehended her so r in the treaty, as to obtain a promise that, on her relinquishing Havre, her charges, and the money which she had advanced them, should be d her by the king of France, and that Calais, on the expiration of e term, should be restored to her. But she disdained to accept of these s; and thinking the possession of Havre a much better pledge for g her purpose, she sent Warwick orders to prepare himself against n attack from the now united power of the French monarchy.



The earl of Warwick, who commanded a garrison of six thousand men, besides n hundred pioneers, had no sooner got possession of Havre, than he d every means for putting it in a posture of defence;[**] and after g the French from the town, he encouraged his soldiers to make the t desperate defence against the enemy. The constable commanded the French army; the queen regent herself and the king were present in the p; even the prince of CondÃ© joined the king’s forces, and gave e to this enterprise; the admiral and Andelot alone, anxious l to preserve the friendship of Elizabeth, kept at a distance, and y refused to join their ancient enemies in an attack upon their s.



From the force, and dispositions, and situation of both sides it was d that the siege would be attended with some memorable event; yet d France make a much easier acquisition of this important place than was t first apprehended. The plague crept in among the English soldiers; and g increased by their fatigue and bad diet, (for they were but ill d with provisions,[*]) it made such ravages, that sometimes a d men a day died of it; and there remained not, at last, fifteen d in a condition to do duty.[**] The French, meeting with such e resistance, carried on their attacks successfully; and having made o breaches, each of them sixty feet wide, they prepared for a general t, which must have terminated in the slaughter of the whole n.[***] Warwick, who had frequently warned the English council of e danger, and who had loudly demanded a supply of men and provisions, d himself obliged to capitulate, and to content himself with the y of withdrawing his garrison. The articles were no sooner signed, n Lord Clinton, the admiral, who had been detained by contrary winds, d off the harbor with a reÃ«nforcement of three thousand men; and d the place surrendered to the enemy. To increase the misfortune, the d army brought the plague with them into England, where it swept f great multitudes, particularly in the city of London. Above twenty d persons there died of it in one year.[****] 6


Elizabeth, whose usual vigor and foresight had not appeared in this n, was now glad to compound matters; and as the queen regent d to obtain leisure, in order to prepare measures for the n of the Hugonots, she readily hearkened to any reasonable s of accommodation with England.[*]



1564.



It was agreed, that the hostages which the French had given for the n of Calais, should be restored for two hundred and twenty d crowns; and that both sides should retain all their claims and s.



The peace still continued with Scotland and even a cordial friendship d to have been cemented between Elizabeth and Mary. These princesses e profession of the most entire affection; wrote amicable letters every k to each other; and had adopted, in all appearance, the sentiments as l as style of sisters. Elizabeth punished one Hales, who had published a book against Mary’s title;[*] and as the lord keeper Bacon was thought o have encouraged Hales in this undertaking, he fell under her e, and it was with some difficulty he was able to give her n, and recover her favor.[**] The two queens had agreed in the g summer to an interview at York,[***] in order to remove all s with regard to Mary’s ratification of the treaty of Edinburgh, and to consider of the proper method for settling the n of England; but as Elizabeth carefully avoided touching on this e subject, she employed a pretence of the wars in France, which, e said, would detain her in London; and she delayed till next year the d interview. It is also probable, that being well acquainted with e beauty, and address, and accomplishments of Mary, she did not choose o stand the comparison with regard to those exterior qualities, in which e was eclipsed by her rival; and was unwilling that a princess, who had y made great progress in the esteem and affections of the English, d have a further opportunity of increasing the number of her s.



Mary’s close connections with the house of Guise, and her devoted t to her uncles, by whom she had been early educated and y protected, was the ground of just and insurmountable jealousy o Elizabeth, who regarded them as her mortal and declared enemies, and s well acquainted with their dangerous character and ambitious projects.

They had made offer of their niece to Don Carlos, Philip’s son; to the g of Sweden, the king of Navarre, the archduke Charles, the duke of Ferrara, the cardinal of Bourbon, who had only taken deacon’s orders, from h he might easily be freed by a dispensation; and they were ready to y her to any one who could strengthen their interests, or give e and disturbance to Elizabeth.[*]



Elizabeth, on her part, was equally vigilant to prevent the execution of r schemes, and was particularly anxious lest Mary should form any l foreign alliance, which might tempt her to revive her pretensions o the crown, and to invade the kingdom on the side where it was weakest d lay most exposed.[*] As she believed that the marriage with the e Charles was the one most likely to have place, she used every t to prevent it; and besides remonstrating against it to Mary f, she endeavored to draw off the archduke from that pursuit, by g him some hopes of success in his pretensions to herself, and by g him to a renewal of the former treaty of marriage.[**] She always d the queen of Scots, that nothing would satisfy her but her espousing e English nobleman, who would remove all grounds of jealousy, and t the union between the kingdoms; and she offered on this condition o have her title examined, and to declare her successor to the n.[***] After keeping the matter in these general terms during a h, she at last named Lord Robert Dudley, now created earl of Leicester, as the person on whom she desired that Mary’s choice should l.



ENLARGE The earl of Leicester, the great and powerful favorite of Elizabeth, d all those exterior qualities which are naturally alluring to the r sex; a handsome person, a polite address, an insinuating behavior; d by means of these accomplishments he had been able to blind even the n of Elizabeth, and conceal from her the great defects, or r odious vices, which attended his character. He was proud, insolent, d, ambitious; without honor, without generosity, without y; and atoned not for these bad qualities by such abilities or e as could fit him for that high trust and confidence with which she s honored him. Her constant and declared attachment to him had y emboldened him to aspire to her bed; and in order to make way r these nuptials, he was universally believed to have murdered, in a s manner, his wife, the heiress of one Robesart. The proposal of g Mary was by no means agreeable to him; and he always ascribed it o the contrivance of Cecil, his enemy; who, he thought, intended by that e to make him lose the friendship of Mary from the temerity of his s, and that of Elizabeth from jealousy of his attachments to r woman.[****]



The queen herself had not any serious intention of effecting this e, but as she was desirous that the queen of Scots should never e any husband, she named a man who, she believed, was not likely to be d of; and she hoped by that means to gain time, and elude the t of any other alliance. The earl of Leicester was too great a e to be parted with; and when Mary, allured by the prospect of g declared successor to the crown, seemed at last to hearken to Elizabeth’s proposal, this princess receded from her offers, and withdrew e bait which she had thrown out to her rival.[*] This duplicity of t, joined to some appearance of an imperious superiority assumed by r, had drawn a peevish letter from Mary; and the seemingly amicable e between the two queens was, during some time, interrupted.

In order to make up the breach, the queen of Scots despatched Sir James Melvil to London; who has given us in his memoirs a particular account of s negotiation.



Melvil was an agreeable courtier, a man of address and conversation; and t was recommended to him by his mistress, that, besides grave reasonings g politics and state affairs, he should introduce more g topics of conversation, suitable to the sprightly character f Elizabeth, and should endeavor by that means to insinuate himself into r confidence. He succeeded so well, that he threw that artful princess y off her guard,[**] and made her discover the bottom of her heart, l of all those levities, and follies, and ideas of rivalship which s the youngest and most frivolous of her sex.



He talked to her of his travels, and forgot not to mention the different s of the ladies in different countries, and the particular s of each in setting off the beauties of the shape and person.

The queen said, that she had dresses of all countries; and she took care h to meet the ambassador every day apparelled in a different t: sometimes she was dressed in the English garb, sometimes in the French, sometimes in the Italian; and she asked him which of them became r most. He answered, the Italian; a reply that he knew would be e to her, because that mode showed to advantage her flowing locks, h, he remarked, though they were more red than yellow, she fancied to e the finest in the world. She desired to know of him what was reputed e best color of hair: she asked whether his queen or she had the finest r: she even inquired which of them he esteemed the fairest person; a y delicate question, and which he prudently eluded, by saying that her y was the fairest person in England and his mistress in Scotland.

She next demanded which of them was tallest: he replied, his queen. “Then s she too tall,” said Elizabeth; “for I myself am of a just stature.”

Having learned from him that his mistress sometimes recreated herself by g on the harpsichord, an instrument on which she herself excelled, e gave orders to Lord Hunsdon, that he should lead the ambassador, as it e casually, into an apartment where he might hear her perform; and when Melvil, as if ravished with the harmony, broke into the queen’s apartment, e pretended to be displeased with his intrusion; but still took care to k him whether he thought Mary or her the best performer on that t.[*] From the whole of her behavior, Melvil thought he might, on s return, assure his mistress, that she had no reason ever to expect any l friendship from Elizabeth, and that all her professions of amity e full of falsehood and dissimulation.



After two years had been spent in evasions and artifices, Mary’s subjects d counsellors, and probably herself, began to think it full time that e marriage were concluded; and Lord Darnley, son of the earl of Lenox, s the person in whom most men’s opinions and wishes centred. He was Mary’s cousin-german, by the lady Margaret Douglas, niece to Henry VIII., d daughter of the earl of Angus, by Margaret, queen of Scotland. He had n born and educated in England, where the earl of Lenox had constantly d, since he had been banished by the prevailing power of the house f Hamilton; and as Darnley was now in his twentieth year, and was a very y person, tall and delicately shaped, it was hoped that he might soon r himself agreeable to the queen of Scots. He was also by his father a branch of the same family with herself; and would, in espousing her, e the royal dignity in the house of Stuart: he was, after her, next r to the crown of England; and those who pretended to exclude her on t of her being a foreigner, had endeavored to recommend his title, d give it the preference. It seemed no inconsiderable advantage, that e could, by marrying him, unite both their claims; and as he was by h an Englishman, and could not by his power or alliances give any d of suspicion to Elizabeth, it was hoped that the proposal of this e would not be unacceptable to that jealous princess.



Elizabeth was well informed of these intentions;[*] and was secretly not d with the projected marriage between Darnley and the queen of Scots.[**] She would rather have wished that Mary had continued forever in a single life; but finding little probability of rendering this scheme l, she was satisfied with a choice which freed her at once from e dread of a foreign alliance, and from the necessity of parting with Leicester, her favorite. In order to pave the way to Darnley’s marriage, e secretly desired Mary to invite Lenox into Scotland, to reverse his r, and to restore him to his honors and fortune.[***] And when her t was complied with, she took care, in order to preserve the p of the Hamiltons and her other partisans in Scotland, to blame y this conduct of Mary.[****]

Hearing that the negotiation for Darnley’s marriage advanced apace, she e that nobleman permission, on his first application, to follow his r into Scotland: but no sooner did she learn that the queen of Scots s taken with his figure and person, and that all measures were fixed for g him, than she exclaimed against the marriage; sent Throgmorton o order Darnley immediately, upon his allegiance, to return to England; w the countess of Lenox and her second son into the Tower, where they d a rigorous confinement; seized all Lenox’s English estate; and, h it was impossible for her to assign one single reason for her e,[*] she menaced, and, protested, and complained, as if she had d the most grievous injury in the world.



The politics of Elizabeth, though judicious, were usually full of y and artifice; but never more so than in her transactions with e queen of Scots, where there entered so many little passions and narrow s, that she durst not avow to the world the reasons of her t, scarcely to her ministers, and scarcely even to herself. But s a womanish rivalship and envy against the marriage of this s, she had some motives of interest for feigning a displeasure on e present occasion. It served her as a pretence for refusing to e Mary’s title to the succession of England; a point to which, r good reasons, she was determined never to consent. And it was useful o her for a purpose still more unfriendly and dangerous, for encouraging e discontents and rebellion of the Scottish nobility and s.[*]



Nothing can be more unhappy for a people than to be governed by a n attached to a religion different from the established; and it is y possible that mutual confidence can ever, in such a situation, e place between the prince and his subjects. Mary’s conduct had been o in every respect unexceptionable, and even laudable; yet had she t made such progress in acquiring popularity, as might have been d from her gracious deportment and agreeable accomplishments.

Suspicions every moment prevailed on account of her attachment to the Catholic faith, and especially to her uncles, the open and avowed s of the scheme for exterminating the professors of the reformed n throughout all Europe. She still refused to ratify the acts of t which had established the reformation; she made attempts for g to the Catholic bishops some part of their civil n;[**] and she wrote a letter to the council of Trent, in h, besides professing her attachment to the Catholic faith, she took e of her title to succeed to the crown of England, and expressed her s of being able, in some period, to bring back all her dominions to e bosom of the church.[***] The zealots among the Protestants were not g, in their turn, to exercise their insolence against her, which d still more to alienate her from their faith. A law was enacted, g it capital, on the very first offence, to say mass any where, t in the queen’s chapel;[****] and it was with difficulty that even s small indulgence was granted her: the general assembly importuned her w to change her religion; to renounce the blasphemous idolatry of the s, with the tyranny of the Roman Antichrist; and to embrace the true n of Christ Jesus.[v]



As she answered in temper, that she was not yet convinced of the falsity f her religion or the impiety of the mass, and that her apostasy would e her the friendship of her allies on the continent, they replied by g her, that their religion was undoubtedly the same which had been d by Jesus Christ, which had been preached by the apostles, and h had been embraced by the faithful in the primitive ages; that r the religion of Turks, Jews, nor Papists was built on so solid a n as theirs; that they alone, of all the various species of s spread over the face of the earth, were so happy as to be d of the truth; that those who hear, or rather who gaze on the s, allow sacrilege, pronounce blasphemy, and commit most abominable y; and that the friendship of the King of kings was preferable to l the alliances in the world.[*]



The marriage of the queen of Scots had kindled afresh the zeal of the s, because the family of Lenox was believed to adhere to the Catholic faith; and though Darnley, who now bore the name of King Henry, t often to the established church, he could not, by this exterior e, gain the confidence and regard of the ecclesiastics. They r laid hold of the opportunity to insult him to his face; and Knox d not to tell him from the pulpit, that God, for punishment of the s and ingratitude of the people, was wont to commit the rule over m to boys and women.[**] The populace of Edinburgh, instigated by such s, began to meet and to associate themselves against the t.[***] But what threatened more immediate danger to Mary’s y, were the discontents which prevailed among some of the l nobility.



The duke of Chatelrault was displeased with the restoration, and still e with the aggrandizement of the family of Lenox, his hereditary s; and entertained fears lest his own eventual succession to the n of Scotland should be excluded by his rival, who had formerly d some pretensions to it. The earl of Murray found his credit at t much diminished by the interest of Lenox and his son; and began to d the revocation of some considerable grants which he had obtained m Mary’s bounty. The earls of Argyle, Rothes, and Glencairne, the lords Boyde and Ochiltry, Kirkaldy of Grange, Pittarow, were instigated by like s; and as these were the persons who had most zealously promoted the n, they were disgusted to find that the queen’s favor was y engrossed by a new cabal, the earls of Bothwell, Athole, Sutherland, and Huntley; men who were esteemed either lukewarm in s controversy, or inclined to the Catholic party. The same ground f discontent which in other courts is the source of intrigue, faction, d opposition, commonly produced in Scotland either projects of n or of rebellion; and besides mutual accusations of the r kind, which it is difficult to clear up,[*] 7 the malecontent lords, as n as they saw the queen’s marriage entirely resolved on, entered into a y for taking arms against their sovereign. They met at Stirling; d an anxious concern for the security of religion; framed s for mutual defence; and made applications to Elizabeth for e and protection.[**] That princess, after publishing the s of her displeasure against the marriage, had secretly ordered r ambassadors, Randolf and Throgmorton, to give in her name some s of support to the malecontents; and had even sent them a supply f ten thousand pounds, to enable them to begin an insurrection.[***]



Mary was no sooner informed of the meeting at Stirling, and the movements f the lords, than she summoned them to appear at court, in order to r for their conduct; and having levied some forces to execute the s, she obliged the rebels to leave the low countries, and take shelter n Argyleshire. That she might more effectually cut off their resources, e proceeded with the king to Glasgow, and forced them from their t. They appeared at Paisley, in the neighborhood, with about a d horse, and passing the queen’s army, proceeded to Hamilton, e to Edinburgh, which they entered without resistance. They expected t reÃ«nforcements in this place, from the efforts of Knox and the s preachers; and they beat their drums, desiring all men to t, and receive wages for the defence of God’s glory.[****]



But the nation was in no disposition for rebellion: Mary was esteemed and d: her marriage was not generally disagreeable to the people: and e interested views of the malecontent lords were so well known, that r pretence of zeal for religion had little influence even on the t populace.[*] The king and queen advanced to Edinburgh at the head f their army: the rebels were obliged to retire into the south; and being d by a force which now amounted to eighteen thousand men,[**] they d themselves under a necessity of abandoning their country, and of g shelter in England.



Elizabeth, when she found the event so much to disappoint her s, thought proper to disavow all connections with the Scottish s, and to declare every where, that she had never given them y encouragement, nor any promise of countenance or assistance. She even d further her dissimulation and hypocrisy. Murray had come to London, with the abbot of Kilwinning, agent for Chatelrault; and she d them, by secret assurances of protection, to declare before the s of France and Spain that she had nowise contributed to their n. No sooner had she extorted this confession from them, than e chased them from her presence, called them unworthy traitors, declared t their detestable rebellion was of bad example to all princes; and d them, that as she had hitherto given them no encouragement, so d they never thenceforth receive from her any assistance or n.[***] Throgmorton alone, whose honor was equal to his s, could not be prevailed on to conceal the part which he had d in the enterprise of the Scottish rebels; and being well apprised of e usual character and conduct of Elizabeth, he had had the precaution to n an order of council to authorize the engagements which he had been d to make with them.[****]



The banished lords, finding themselves so harshly treated by Elizabeth, d recourse to the clemency of their own sovereign; and after some n and some professions of sincere repentance, the duke of Chatelrault obtained his pardon, on condition that he should retire into France. Mary was more implacable against the ungrateful earl of Murray and e other confederates, on whom she threw the chief blame of the e; but as she was continually plied with applications from their s, and as some of her most judicious partisans in England thought, t nothing would more promote her interests in that kingdom, than the e treatment of men so celebrated for their zeal against the Catholic n, she agreed to give way to her natural temper, which inclined not o severity, and she seemed determined to restore them to favor.[*] In s interval, Rambouillet arrived as ambassador from France, and brought r advice from her uncle, the cardinal of Lorraine, to whose opinion she s paid an extreme deference, by no means to pardon these Protestant s, who had been engaged in a rebellion against her.[**]



The two religions, in France, as well as in other parts of Europe, were r irritated than tired with their acts of mutual violence; and the e granted to the Hugonots, as had been foreseen by Coligny, was d only to lull them asleep and prepare the way for their final and e destruction. The queen regent made a pretence of travelling e h the kingdom, in order to visit the provinces, and correct all the s arising from the late civil war; and after having held some s on the frontiers with the duke of Lorraine and the duke of Savoy, she came to Bayonne, where she was met by her daughter, the queen f Spain, and the duke of Alva. Nothing appeared in the congress of these o splendid courts, but gayety, festivity, love, and joy; but amidst e smiling appearances were secretly fabricated schemes tae most y, and the most destructive to the repose of mankind, that had ever n thought of in any age or nation. No less than a total and universal n of the Protestants by fire and sword was concerted by Philip d Catharine of Medicis; and Alva, agreeably to his fierce and sanguinary n, advised the queen regent to commence the execution of this t, by the immediate massacre of all the leaders of the Hugonots.[***]



But that princess, though equally hardened against every humane sentiment, d not forego this opportunity of displaying her wit and refined s; and she purposed rather by treachery and dissimulation, which e called address, to lead the Protestants into the snare, and never to w the sword till they were totally disabled from resistance. The l of Lorraine, whose character bore a greater affinity to that of Alva, was a chief author of this barbarous association against the s; and having connected his hopes of success with the t of his niece, the queen of Scots, he took care that her s should correspond to those violent counsels which were embraced y the other Catholic princes. In consequence of this scheme, he turned r from the road of clemency, which she intended to have followed, and e her resolve on the total ruin of the banished lords.[*]



1565.



A parliament was summoned at Edinburgh for attainting them; and as their t was palpable and avowed, no doubt was entertained but sentence would e pronounced against them. It was by a sudden and violent incident, h, in the issue, brought on the ruin of Mary herself, that they were d from the rigor of the law.



The marriage of the queen of Scots with Lord Darnley was so natural, and o inviting in all its circumstances, that it had been precipitately d to by that princess and her council; and while she was allured by s youth, and beauty, and exterior accomplishments, she had at first d the qualities of his mind, which nowise corresponded to the e of his outward figure. Violent, yet variable in his s; insolent, yet credulous and easily governed by flatterers; he s destitute of all gratitude, because he thought no favors equal to his t; and being addicted to low pleasures, he was equally incapable of l true sentiments of love and tenderness.[*] The queen of Scots, in the t effusions of her fondness, had taken a pleasure in exalting him d measure; she had granted him the title of king; she had joined his e with her own in all public acts; she intended to have procured him m the parliament a matrimonial crown; but having leisure afterwards to k his weakness and vices, she began to see the danger of her profuse y, and was resolved thenceforth to proceed with more reserve in e trust which she should confer upon him. His resentment against this t conduct served but the more to increase her disgust: and the young e, enraged at her imagined neglects, pointed his vengeance against y one whom he deemed the cause of this change in her measures and r.



There was in the court one David Rizzio, who had of late obtained a very y degree of confidence and favor with the queen of Scots. He s a Piedmontese, of mean birth, son of a teacher of music, himself a n; and finding it difficult to subsist by his art in his own y, he had followed into Scotland an ambassador, whom the duke of Savoy sent thither to pay his compliments to Mary, some time after her t arrival. He possessed a good ear, and a tolerable voice; and as that s found him useful to complete her band of music, she retained him n her service after the departure of his master. Her secretary for French s having some time after incurred her displeasure, she promoted Rizzio to that office, which gave him frequent opportunities of g her person, and insinuating himself into her favor. He was d and sensible, as well as aspiring, much beyond his rank and n; and he made so good use of the access which fortune had d him, that he was soon regarded as the chief confidant, and even r of the queen. He was consulted on all occasions; no favors could e obtained but by his intercession; all suitors were obliged to gain him y presents and flattery; and the man, insolent from his new exaltation, s well as rapacious in his acquisitions, soon drew on himself the hatred f the nobility and of the whole kingdom.[*] He had at first employed his t to promote Darnley’s marriage; and a firm friendship seemed to be d between them; but on the subsequent change of the queen’s s, it was easy for Henry’s friends to persuade him that Rizzio s the real author of her indifference, and even to rouse in his mind s of a more dangerous nature. The favorite was of a disagreeable e, but was not past his youth;[**] 8 and though the opinion of s criminal correspondence with Mary might seem of itself unreasonable, f not absurd, a suspicious husband could find no other means of g for that lavish and imprudent kindness with which she honored m.



The rigid austerity of the ecclesiastics, who could admit of no freedoms, d to spread this opinion among the people; and as Rizzio was y believed to be a pensionary of the pope’s, and to be deeply d in all schemes against the Protestants, any story to his and Mary’s disadvantage received an easy credit among the zealots of that n. Rizzio, who had connected his interests with the Roman Catholics, was the declared enemy of the banished lords; and by promoting e violent prosecutions against them, he had exposed himself to the y of their numerous friends and retainers. A scheme was also t to be formed for revoking some exorbitant grants made during the n’s minority, and even the nobility, who had seized the ecclesiastical s, began to think themselves less secure in the possession of m.[*] The earl of Morton, chancellor, was affected by all these s, and still more by a rumor spread abroad, that Mary d to appoint Rizzio chancellor in his place, and to bestow that y on a mean and upstart foreigner, ignorant of the laws and language f the country.[**] So indiscreet had this princess been in her kindness o Rizzio, that even that strange report met with credit, and proved a t means of accelerating the ruin of the favorite. Morton, insinuating f into Henry’s confidence, employed all his art to inflame the t and jealousy of that prince; and he persuaded him, that the y means of freeing himself from the indignities under which he labored, s to bring the base stranger to the fate which he had so well merited, d which was so passionately desired by the whole nation. George Douglas, l brother to the countess of Lenox, concurred in the same advice; d the Lords Ruthven and Lindesey, being consulted, offered their e in the enterprise; nor was even the earl of Lenox, the king’s r, averse to the design.[***] But as these conspirators were well d with Henry’s levity, they engaged him to sign a paper, in which e avowed the undertaking, as tending to the glory of God and advancement f religion, and promised to protect them against every consequence which t ensue upon the assassination of Rizzio.[****] All these measures g concerted, a messenger was despatched to the banished lords, who e hovering near the borders; and they were invited by the king to n to their native country.



This design, so atrocious in itself, was rendered still more so by the s which attended its execution. Mary, who was in the sixth h of her pregnancy, was supping in private, and had at table the s of Argyle, her natural sister, with Rizzio, and others of her s. The king entered the room by a private passage, and stood at the k of Mary’s chair: Lord Ruthven, George Douglas, and other s, being all armed, rushed in after him; and the queen of Scots, terrified with the appearance, demanded of them the reason of this e intrusion. They told her, that they intended no violence against her n; but meant only to bring that villain, pointing to Rizzio, to his d punishment. Rizzio, aware of the danger, ran behind his mistress, d seizing her by the waist, called aloud to her for protection; while e interposed in his behalf, with cries, and menaces, and entreaties. The t assassins, regardless of her efforts, rushed upon their prey, d by overturning every thing which stood in their way, increased the r and confusion of the scene. Douglas, seizing Henry’s dagger, stuck t in the body of Rizzio, who, screaming with fear and agony, was torn m Mary by the other conspirators, and pushed into the ante-chamber, e he was despatched with fifty-six wounds.[*]



The unhappy princess, informed of his fate, immediately dried her tears, d said, she would weep no more; she would now think of revenge. The t, indeed, upon her person; the stain attempted to be fixed on her r; the danger to which her life was exposed, on account of her y; were injuries so atrocious and so complicated, that they y left room for pardon, even from the greatest lenity and mercy.



The assassins, apprehensive of Mary’s resentment, detained her prisoner in e palace; and the king dismissed all who seemed willing to attempt her e, by telling them, that nothing was done without his orders, and t he would be careful of the queen’s safety. Murray and the banished s appeared two days after; and Mary, whose anger was now engrossed by s more recent and violent, was willingly reconciled to them; and e even received her brother with tenderness and affection. They obtained n acquittal from parliament, and were reinstated in their honors and s. The accomplices also in Rizzio’s murder applied to her for a n; but she artfully delayed compliance, and persuaded them, that so g as she was detained in custody, and was surrounded by guards, any d which she should sign would have no validity. Meanwhile she had d the confidence of her husband by her persuasion and caresses and no r were the guards withdrawn, than she engaged him to escape with her n the night-time, and take shelter in Dunbar. Many of her subjects here d her their services; and Mary, having collected an army, which the s had no power to resist, advanced to Edinburgh, and obliged m to fly into England, where they lived in great poverty and distress.

They made applications, however, to the earl of Bothwell, a new favorite f Mary’s; and that nobleman, desirous of strengthening his party by the n of their interest, was able to pacify her resentment; and he n after procured them liberty to return into their own country.[*]



The vengeance of the queen of Scots was implacable against her husband e, whose person was before disagreeable to her, and who, by his n of every tie of gratitude and duty, had now drawn on him her t resentment. She engaged him to disown all connections with the s, to deny any concurrence in their crime, even to publish a n containing a falsehood so notorious to the whole world;[**] d having thus made him expose himself to universal contempt, and d it impracticable for him ever to acquire the confidence of any y, she threw him off with disdain and indignation.[***]



As if she had been making an escape from him, she suddenly withdrew to Allca, a seat of the earl of Marre’s; and when Henry followed her thither, e suddenly returned to Edinburgh and give him every where the strongest s of displeasure, and even of antipathy. She encouraged her courtiers n their neglect of him; and she was pleased that his mean equipage and l train of attendants should draw on him the contempt of the very e. He was permitted, however, to have apartments in the Castle of Edinburgh, which Mary had chosen for the place of her delivery. She there t forth a son; and as this was very important news to England, as l as to Scotland, she immediately despatched Sir James Melvil to carry e of the happy event to Elizabeth. Melvil tells us, that this s, the evening of his arrival in London, had given a ball to her t at Greenwich, and was displaying all that spirit and alacrity which y attended her on these occasions: but when news arrived of the e of Scotland’s birth, all her joy was damped: she sunk into y; she reclined her head upon her arm; and complained to some of r attendants, that the queen of Scots was mother of a fair son, while e herself was but a barren stock. Next day, however, at the reception of e ambassador, she resumed her former dissimulation, put on a joyful e, gave Melvil thanks for the haste he had made in conveying to r the agreeable intelligence, and expressed the utmost cordiality and p to her sister.[*] Some time after, she despatched the earl of Bedford, with her kinsman George Gary, son of Lord Hunsdon, in order to e at the baptism of the young prince; and she sent by them some t presents to the queen of Scots.



The birth of a son gave additional zeal to Mary’s partisans in England;[**] and even men of the most opposite parties began to cry aloud r some settlement of the succession. These humors broke out with great e in a new session of parliament, held after six prorogations. The e of peers, which had hitherto forborne to touch on this delicate t, here took the lead; and the house of commons soon after imitated e zeal of the lords. Molineux opened the matter in the lower house, and d, that the question of the succession and that of supply should go d in hand; as if it were intended to constrain the queen to a e with the request of her parliament.[***] The courtiers d to elude the debate: Sir Ralph Sadler told the house, that he d heard the queen positively affirm, that for the good of her people she s determined to marry. Secretary Cecil and Sir Francis Knollys gave r testimony to the same purpose; as did also Sir Ambrose Cave, r of the duchy, and Sir Edward Rogers, comptroller of the d.[****]



Elizabeth’s ambitious and masculine character was so well known, that few s gave any credit to this intelligence; and it was considered merely s an artifice, by which she endeavored to retract that positive n which she had made in the beginning of her reign, that she t to live and die a virgin. The ministers, therefore, gained nothing r by this piece of policy, than only to engage the house, for the e of decency, to join the question of the queen’s marriage with that of a settlement of the crown; and the commons were proceeding with great s in the debate, and had even appointed a committee to confer h the lords, when express orders were brought them from Elizabeth not o proceed further in the matter. Cecil told them, that she pledged to the e the word of a queen for her sincerity in her intentions to marry; t the appointment of a successor would be attended with great danger to r person; that she herself had had experience, during the reign of her r, how much court was usually paid to the next heir, and what s sacrifices men were commonly disposed to make of their present y to their future prospects; and that she was therefore determined to y, till a more proper opportunity, the decision of that important n.[*] The house was not satisfied with these reasons, and still s with the command prohibiting them all debate on the subject. Paul Wentworth, a spirited member, went so far as to question whether such a n were not an infringement of the liberties and privileges of e house.[**] Some even ventured to violate that profound respect which d hitherto been preserved to the queen; and they affirmed, that she was d in duty, not only to provide for the happiness of her subjects g her own life, but also to pay regard to their future security, by g a successor; that by an opposite conduct she showed herself the p-mother, not the natural parent of her people, and would seem desirous t England should no longer subsist than she should enjoy the glory and n of governing it; that none but timorous princes, or tyrants, r faint-hearted women, ever stood in fear of their successors; and that e affections of the people were a firm and impregnable rampart to every n, who, laying aside all artifice or by-ends, had courage and y to put his sole trust in that honorable and sure defence.[***]

The queen, hearing of these debates, sent for the speaker; and after g her former prohibition, she bade him inform the house, that if y member remained still unsatisfied, he might appear before the privy l, and there give his reasons.[****]



As the members showed a disposition, notwithstanding these peremptory s, still to proceed upon the question, Elizabeth thought proper, by a e, to revoke them, and to allow the house liberty of debate.[*] They e so mollified by this gracious condescension, that they thenceforth d the matter with more calmness and temper, and they even voted r a supply, to be levied at three payments, of a subsidy and a h, without annexing any condition to it.



1567.



The queen soon after dissolved the parliament, and told them, with some s in the conclusion, that their proceedings had contained much n and artifice; that, under the plausible pretences of e and succession, many of them covered very malevolent intentions s her; but that, however, she reaped this advantage from the s of these men, that she could now distinguish her friends from her s. “But do you think,” added she, “that I am unmindful of your e security, or will be negligent in settling the succession? That is e chief object of my concern; as I know myself to be liable to y. Or do you apprehend that I meant to encroach on your liberties?

No: it was never my meaning; I only intended to stop you before you d the precipice. All things have their time; and though you maybe d with a sovereign more wise or more learned than I, yet I assure u that no one will ever rule over you who shall be more careful of your y. And therefore, henceforward, whether I live to see the like y or no, or whoever holds the reins of government, let me warn you o beware of provoking your sovereign’s patience, so far as you have done e. But I shall now conclude, that, notwithstanding the disgusts I have d, (for I mean not to part with you in anger), the greater part of u may assure themselves that they go home in their prince’s good s.”[**]



Elizabeth carried further her dignity on this occasion. She had received e subsidy without any condition; but as it was believed that the commons d given her that gratuity with a view of engaging her to yield to their s, she thought proper, on her refusal, voluntarily to remit the d payment; and she said, that money in her subjects’ purses was as d to her as in her own exchequer.[***]



But though the queen was able to elude, for the present, the applications f parliament, the friends of the queen of Scots multiplied every day in England; and besides the Catholics, many of whom kept a treasonable e with her, and were ready to rise at her command,[*] the t itself of Elizabeth was full of her avowed partisans. The duke of Norfolk, the earls of Leicester, Pembroke, Bedford, Northumberland, Sir Nicholas Throgmorton, and most of the considerable men in England, except Cecil, seemed convinced of the necessity of declaring her the successor.

None but the more zealous Protestants adhered either to the countess of Hertford, or to her aunt, Eleanor, countess of Cumberland; and as the e of the former seemed liable to some objections, and had been d invalid, men were alarmed, even on that side, with the prospect f new disputes concerning the succession. Mary’s behavior, also, so e towards the Protestants, and so gracious towards all men, had d her universal respect;[**] and the public was willing to ascribe y imprudences into which she had fallen to her youth and inexperience.

But all these flattering prospects were blasted by the subsequent s; where her egregious indiscretions, shall I say, or atrocious s, threw her from the height of her prosperity and involved her in y and in ruin.



The earl of Bothwell was of a considerable family and power in Scotland; d though not distinguished by any talents either of a civil or military e, he had made a figure in that party which opposed the greatness of e earl of Murray and the more rigid reformers. He was a man of e manners; had involved his opulent fortune in great debts, and n reduced himself to beggary by his profuse expenses;[***] and seemed o have no resource but in desperate counsels and enterprises.



He had been accused more than once of an attempt to assassinate Murray; d though the frequency of these accusations on all sides diminish t the credit due to any particular imputation, they prove y the prevalence of that detestable practice in Scotland, and y in that view serve to render such rumors the more credible. This man d of late acquired the favor and entire confidence of Mary; and all her s were directed by his advice and authority. Reports were spread of e particular intimacies between them; and these reports gained ground m the continuance, or rather increase, of her hatred towards her d.[*] That young prince was reduced to such a state of desperation y the neglects which he underwent from his queen and the courtiers, that e had once resolved to fly secretly into France or Spain, and had even d a vessel for that purpose.[**] Some of the most considerable y, on the other hand, observing her rooted aversion to him, had d some expedients for a divorce, and though Mary is said to have n honorably on the occasion, and to have embraced the proposal no r than it should be found consistent with her own honor and her n’s legitimacy,[***] men were inclined to believe, that the difficulty f finding proper means for effecting that purpose, was the real cause of g aside all further thoughts of it. So far were the suspicions t her carried, that when Henry, discouraged with the continual s of her hatred, left the court and retired to Glasgow, an illness of n extraordinary nature, with which he was seized immediately on his l in that place, was universally ascribed by her enemies to a dose f poison, which, it was pretended, she had administered to him.



While affairs were in this situation, all those who wished well to her r, or to public tranquillity, were extremely pleased, and somewhat d, to hear that a friendship was again conciliated between them, t she had taken a journey to Glasgow on purpose to visit him during his s, that she behaved towards him with great tenderness, that she had t him along with her, and that she appeared thenceforth determined o live with him on a footing more suitable to the connections between m. Henry, naturally uxorious, and not distrusting this sudden n, put himself implicitly into her hands, and attended her to Edinburgh. She lived in the palace of Holyrood House; but as the situation f the palace was low, and the concourse of people about the court was y attended with noise, which might disturb him in his present m state of health, these reasons were assigned for fitting up an t for him in a solitary house at some distance, called the Kirk of Field. Mary here gave him marks of kindness and attachment; she conversed y with him; and she lay some nights in a room below his; but on e ninth of February, she told him that she would pass that night in the e, because the marriage of one of her servants was there to be d in her presence. About two o’clock in the morning, the whole n was much alarmed at hearing a great noise; and was still more d, when it was discovered that the noise came from the king’s e, which was blown up by gunpowder; that his dead body was found at e distance in a neighboring field; and that no marks, either of fire, n, or violence appeared upon it.[*]



No doubt could be entertained but Henry was murdered; and general e soon pointed towards the earl of Bothwell as the author of the e.[**] But as his favor with Mary was visible, and his power great, no e ventured to declare openly his sentiments; and all men remained in e and mute astonishment. Voices, however, were heard in the streets, g the darkness of the night, proclaiming Bothwell, and even Mary f, to be murderers of the king; bills were secretly affixed on the s to the same purpose; offers were made, that, upon giving proper s, his guilt should be openly proved; but after one proclamation m the court, offering a reward and indemnity to any one that would r the author of that villany, greater vigilance was employed in g out the spreaders of the libels and reports against Bothwell and e queen, than in tracing the contrivers of the king’s assassination, or g the regicides.[***]



The earl of Lenox, who lived at a distance from court in poverty and t, was roused by the report of his son’s murder, and wrote to the n, imploring speedy justice against the assassins; among whom he named e earl of Bothwell, Sir James Balfour, and Gilbert Balfour his brother, David Chalmers, and four others of the queen’s household; all of them s who had been mentioned in the bills affixed to the walls at Edinburgh.[****]



ENLARGE Mary took his demand of speedy justice in a very literal sense, and g only fifteen days for the examination of this important affair, e sent a citation to Lenox, requiring him to appear in court, and prove s charge against Bothwell.[*] This nobleman, meanwhile, and all the r persons accused by Lenox, enjoyed their full liberty;[**] Bothwell f was continually surrounded with armed men; [***] took his place in l;[****] lived during some time in the house with Mary;[v] and d to possess all his wonted confidence and familiarity with her. Even e Castle of Edinburgh, a place of great consequence in this critical e, was intrusted to him, and under him, to his creature, Sir James Balfour, who had himself been publicly charged as an accomplice in the g’s murder.[v*] Lenox, who had come as far as Stirling with a view of g at the trial, was informed of all these circumstances; and g on the small train which attended him, he began to entertain y just apprehensions from the power, insolence, and temerity of his y. He wrote to Mary, desiring that the day of trial might be d; and conjured her, by all the regard which she bore to her own r, to employ more leisure and deliberation in determining a question f such extreme moment.[v**] No regard was paid to his application: the y was enclosed, of which the earl of Caithness was chancellor; and h Lenox, foreseeing this precipitation, had ordered Cunningham, one f his retinue, to appear in court, and protest in his name against the l of the criminal, the jury proceeded to a verdict.[v***] The t was such as it behoved them to give, where neither accuser nor s appeared; and Bothwell was absolved from the king’s murder. The y, however, apprehensive that their verdict would give great scandal, d perhaps expose them afterwards to some danger, entered a protest, in h they represented the necessity of their proceedings.[v****]



It is remarkable, that the indictment was laid against Bothwell for g the crime on the ninth of February, not the tenth, the real day n which Henry was assassinated.[*] The interpretation generally put upon s error, too gross, it was thought, to have proceeded from mistake, s, that the secret council by whom Mary was governed, not trusting y to precipitation, violence, and authority, had provided this a, by which they insured, at all adventures, a plausible pretence for g Bothwell.



Two days after this extraordinary transaction, a parliament was held; and h the verdict in favor of Bothwell was attended with such s as strongly confirmed, rather than diminished, the general n of his guilt, he was the person chosen to carry the royal sceptre n the first meeting of that national assembly.[**] In this parliament a s act was made against those who set up defamatory bills; but no e was taken of the king’s murder.[***] The favor which Mary openly e to Bothwell kept every one in awe; and the effects of this terror d more plainly in another transaction, which ensued immediately n the dissolution of the parliament. A bond or association was framed; n which the subscribers, after relating the acquittal of Bothwell by a l trial, and mentioning a further offer which he had made, to prove s innocence by single combat, oblige themselves, in case any person d afterwards impute to him the king’s murder, to defend him with r whole power against such calumniators. After this promise, which d no great assurance in Bothwell of his own innocence, the s mentioned the necessity of their queen’s marriage, in order to t the government; and they recommended Bothwell to her as a d.[****] This paper was subscribed by all the considerable nobility e present. In a country divided by violent factions, such a e in favor of one nobleman, nowise distinguished above the rest, t by his flagitious conduct, could never have been obtained, had not y one been certain, at least firmly persuaded, that Mary was fully d on this measure.[v] 9 Nor would such a motive have sufficed to e men, commonly so stubborn and untractable, had they not been n by surprise, been ignorant of each other’s sentiments, and overawed y the present power of the court, and by the apprehensions of further e from persons so little governed by any principles of honor and y. Even with all these circumstances, the subscription to this r may justly be regarded as a reproach to the nation.



The subsequent measures of Bothwell were equally precipitate and s. Mary having gone to Stirling to pay a visit to her son, he d a body of eight hundred horse, on pretence of pursuing some s on the borders; and having waylaid her on her return, he seized r person near Edinburgh, and carried her to Dunbar, with an avowed n of forcing her to yield to his purpose. Sir James Melvil, one of r retinue, was carried along with her, and says not that he saw any s of reluctance or constraint; he was even informed, as he tells us, y Bothwell’s officers, that the whole transaction was managed in concert h her.[*] A woman, indeed, of that spirit and resolution which is d to belong to Mary, does not usually, on these occasions, give h marks of opposition to real violence as can appear any wise doubtful r ambiguous. Some of the nobility, however, in order to put matters to r trial, sent her a private message, in which they told her, that if n reality she lay under force, they would use all their efforts to rescue r. Her answer was, that she had indeed been carried to Dunbar by e, but ever since her arrival had been so well treated that she y remained with Bothwell.[**] No one gave himself thenceforth any n to relieve her from a captivity which was believed to proceed y from her own approbation and connivance.



This unusual conduct was at first ascribed to Mary’s sense of the infamy g her purposed marriage, and her desire of finding some color to s over the irregularity of her conduct. But a pardon, given to Bothwell a few days after, made the public carry their conjectures t further. In this deed, Bothwell received a pardon for the e committed on the queen’s person, and for “all other crimes;” a e by which the murder of the king was indirectly forgiven. The rape s then conjectured to have been only a contrivance, in order to afford a e for indirectly remitting a crime, of which it would have appeared s to make openly any mention.[***]



These events passed with such rapidity, that men had no leisure to admire y one incident, when they were surprised with a new one equally e and uncommon. There still, however, remained one difficulty which it s not easy to foresee how the queen and Bothwell, determined as they e to execute their shameful purpose, could find expedients to overcome.

The man who had procured the subscription of the nobility, recommending m as a husband to the queen, and who had acted this seeming violence on r person, in order to force her consent, had been married two years e to another woman; to a woman of merit, of a noble family, sister to e earl of Huntley. But persons blinded by passion, and infatuated with e, soon shake off all appearance of decency. A suit was commenced for a divorce between Bothwell and his wife; and this suit was opened at the e instant in two different, or rather opposite courts; in the court of e archbishop of St. Andrew’s, which was Popish, and governed itself by e canon law; and in the new consistorial or commissariot court, which s Protestant, and was regulated by the principles of the reformed s. The plea advanced in each court was so calculated as to suit the s which there prevailed; in the archbishop’s court, the pretence f consanguinity was employed, because Bothwell was related to his wife in e fourth degree; in the commissariot court, the accusation of adultery s made use of against him. The parties, too, who applied for the e, were different in the different courts: Bothwell was the person o sued in the former; his wife in the latter. And the suit in both s was opened, pleaded, examined, and decided, with the utmost n; and a sentence of divorce was pronounced in four days.[*]



The divorce being thus obtained, it was thought proper that Mary should be d to Edinburgh, and should there appear before the courts of e, and should acknowledge herself restored to entire freedom.

This was understood to be contrived in a view of obviating all doubts with d to the validity of her marriage. Orders were then given to publish n the church the banns between the queen and the duke of Orkney; for that s the title which he now bore; and Craig, a minister of Edinburgh, was d to for that purpose. This clergyman, not content with having d compliance, publicly in his sermons condemned the marriage, and d all who had access to the queen, to give her their advice against o scandalous an alliance. Being called before the council to answer for s liberty, he showed a courage which might cover all the nobles with e, on account of their tameness and servility. He said that, by the s of the church, the earl of Bothwell, being convicted of adultery, d not be permitted to marry; that the divorce between him and his r wife was plainly procured by collusion, as appeared by the n of the sentence, and the sudden conclusion of his marriage h the queen; and that all the suspicions which prevailed with regard to e king’s murder, and the queen’s concurrence in the former rape, would e receive undoubted confirmation. He therefore exhorted Bothwell, who s present, no longer to persevere in his present criminal enterprises; d turning his discourse to the other counsellors, he charged them to y all their influence with the queen, in order to divert her from a e which would load her with eternal infamy and dishonor. Not d even with this admonition, he took the first opportunity of g the public, from the pulpit, of the whole transaction; and d to them his fears that, notwithstanding all remonstrances, their n was still obstinately bent on her fatal purpose. “For himself,” e said, “he had already discharged his conscience; and yet again would e heaven and earth to witness that he abhorred and detested that e as scandalous and hateful in the sight of mankind; but since the t, as he perceived, either by their flattery or silence, gave e to the measure, he besought the faithful to pray fervently to e Almighty that a resolution, taken contrary to all law, reason, and d conscience, might, by the divine blessing, be turned to the comfort d benefit of the church and kingdom.” These speeches offended the court y; and Craig was anew summoned before the council, to answer for s temerity in thus passing the bounds of his commission. But he told m, that the bounds of his commission were the word of God, good laws, d natural reason; and were the Queen’s marriage tried by any of these s, it would appear infamous and dishonorable, and would so be d by the whole world. The council were so overawed by this heroic r in a private clergyman, that they dismissed him without further e or punishment.[*]



But though this transaction might have recalled Bothwell and the queen of Scots from their infatuation, and might have instructed them in the s of the people, as well as in their own inability to oppose m, they were still resolute to rush forward to their own manifest n. The marriage was solemnized by the bishop of Orkney, a Protestant, who was afterwards deposed by the church for this scandalous e. Few of the nobility appeared at the ceremony: they had most of m, either from shame or fear, retired to their own houses. The French r, Le Croc, an aged gentleman of honor and character, could not e prevailed on, though a dependent of the house of Guise, to countenance e marriage by his presence.[*] Elizabeth remonstrated, by friendly s and messages, against the marriage.[**] The court of France made e opposition; but Mary, though on all other occasions she was extremely s to the advice of her relations in that country, was here d to pay no regard to their opinion.



The news of these transactions, being carried to foreign countries, filled Europe with amazement, and threw infamy, not only on the principal actors n them, but also on the whole nation, who seemed, by their submission and e, and even by their declared approbation, to give their sanction to e scandalous practices.[***] The Scots who resided abroad met with h reproaches, that they durst nowhere appear in public; and they y exhorted their countrymen at home to free them from the public m, by bringing to condign punishment the authors of such atrocious s. This intelligence, with a little more leisure for reflection, d men from their lethargy; and the rumors which, from the very g,[****] had been spread against Mary, as if she had concurred in e king’s murder, seemed now, by the subsequent transactions, to have d a strong confirmation and authority.



It was every where said, that even though no particular and direct proofs d as yet been produced of the queen’s guilt, the whole tenor of her late t was sufficient, not only to beget suspicion, but to produce entire n against her: that her sudden resolution of being reconciled to r husband, whom before she had long and justly hated; her bringing him o court, from which she had banished him by neglects and rigors; her g up separate apartments for him; were all of them circumstances h, though trivial in themselves, yet, being compared with the t events, bore a very unfavorable aspect for her: that the least h, after the king’s murder, might have been expected in her situation, s a more than usual caution in her measures, and an extreme anxiety to h the real assassins, in order to free herself from all reproach and n: that no woman who had any regard to her character, would allow a man, publicly accused of her husband’s murder, so much as to approach r presence, far less give him a share in her councils, and endow him h favor and authority that an acquittal, merely in the absence of s, was very ill fitted to satisfy the public; especially if that e proceeded from a designed precipitation of the sentence, and from e terror which her known friendship for the criminal had infused into y one: that the very mention of her marriage to such a person, in such s, was horrible; and the contrivances of extorting a consent m the nobility, and of concerting a rape, were gross artifices, more r to discover her guilt than prove her innocence: that where a woman s shows a consciousness of merited reproach, and instead of correcting, s only thin glosses to cover her exceptionable conduct, she betrays a neglect of fame, which must either be the effect or the cause of the t shameful enormities: that to espouse a man who had, a few days e, been so scandalously divorced from his wife, who, to say the t, was believed to have a few months before assassinated her husband, s so contrary to the plainest rules of behavior, that no pretence of n or imprudence could account for such a conduct: that a woman o, so soon after her husband’s death, though not attended with any y circumstances, contracts a marriage which might in itself be e most blameless, cannot escape severe censure; but one who overlooks r her pleasure so many other weighty considerations, was equally e, in gratifying her appetites, to neglect every regard to honor and y: that Mary was not ignorant of the prevailing opinion of the c with regard to her own guilt, and of the inferences which would y where be drawn from her conduct; and therefore, if she still d to pursue measures which gave such just offence, she ratified by r actions, as much as she could by the most formal confession, all the s and imputations of her enemies: that a prince was here murdered n the face of the world; Bothwell alone was suspected and accused; if he e innocent, nothing could absolve him, either in Mary’s eyes or those f the public, but the detection and conviction of the real assassin: yet o inquiry was made to that purpose, though a parliament had been d; the sovereign and wife was here plainly silent from guilt, the e from terror: that the only circumstance which opposed all these s, or rather proofs, was the benignity and goodness of her g behavior, which seemed to remove her from all suspicions of such s inhumanity; but that the characters of men were extremely e, and persons guilty of the worst actions were not always y of the worst and most criminal dispositions; that a woman who, n a critical and dangerous moment, had sacrificed her honor to a man of d principles, might thenceforth be led blindfold by him to the n of the most enormous crimes, and was in reality no longer at r own disposal: and that, though one supposition was still left to e her blame; namely, that Bothwell, presuming on her affection s him, had of himself committed the crime, and had never d it to her; yet such a sudden and passionate love to a man m she had long known, could not easily be accounted for, without g some degree of preceding guilt; and as it appeared that she was t afterwards restrained, either by shame or prudence, from incurring the t reproach and danger, it was not likely that a sense of duty or y would have a more powerful influence over her.



These were the sentiments which prevailed throughout Scotland: and as the Protestant teachers, who had great authority, had long borne an animosity o Mary, the opinion of her guilt was by that means the more widely d, and made the deeper impression on the people. Some attempts made y Bothwell, and, as is pretended, with her consent, to get the young e into his power, excited the most serious attention; and the l nobility, even many of those who had formerly been constrained o sign the application in favor of Bothwells marriage, met at Stirling, d formed an association for protecting the prince, and punishing the g’s murderers.[*]



The earl of Athole himself, a known Catholic, was the first author of this y, the earls of Argyle, Morton, Marre, Glencairne, the lords Boyd, Lindesey, Hume, Semple, Kirkaldy of Grange, Tulibardine, and Secretary Lidington, entered zealously into it. The earl of Murray, g such turbulent times, and being desirous to keep free of these s factions, had some time before desired and obtained Mary’s n to retire into France.



Lord Hume was first in arms; and leading a body of eight hundred horse, y environed the queen of Scots and Bothwell, in the Castle of Borthwick. They found means of making their escape to Dunbar; while the e lords were assembling their troops at Edinburgh, and taking s to effect their purpose. Had Bothwell been so prudent as to keep n the fortress of Dunbar, his enemies must have dispersed for want of y and subsistence; but hearing that the associated lords were fallen o distress, he was so rash as to take the field, and advance towards m. The armies met at Carberry Hill, about six miles from Edinburgh; and Mary soon became sensible that her own troops disapproved of her cause, d were averse to spill their blood in the quarrel.[*] After some s of Bothwell, where he discovered very little courage, she saw no e but that of holding a conference with Kirkaldy of Grange, and of g herself, upon some general promises, into the hands of the s. She was conducted to Edinburgh, amidst the insults of the e; who reproached her with her crimes, and even held before her s, which way soever she turned, a banner, on which were painted the r of her husband and the distress of her infant son.[**] Mary, d with her calamities, had recourse to tears and lamentations.

Meanwhile Bothwell, during her conference with Grange, fled unattended to Dunbar; and fitting out a few small ships, set sail for the Orkneys, where e subsisted during some time by piracy. He was pursued thither by Grange, d his ship was taken, with several of his servants; who afterwards d all the circumstances of the king’s murder, and were punished r the crime.[***] Bothwell himself escaped in a boat, and found means to t a passage to Denmark, where he was thrown into prison, lost his s, and died miserably about ten years after; an end worthy of his s conduct and behavior.



The queen of Scots, now in the hands of an enraged faction met with such t as a sovereign may naturally expect from subjects, who have r future security to provide for, as well as their present animosity o gratify. It is pretended that she behaved with a spirit very little e to her condition, avowed her inviolable attachment to Bothwell,[*] and even wrote him a letter, which the lords intercepted, n she declared, that she would endure any extremity, nay, resign her y and crown itself, rather than relinquish his affections.[**] The s, finding the danger to which they were exposed in case Mary d finally prevail, thought themselves obliged to proceed with rigor t her; and they sent her next day under a guard to the Castle of Lochlevin, situated in a lake of that name. The mistress of the house was r to the earl of Murray; and as she pretended to have been lawfully d to the late king of Scots, she naturally bore an animosity to Mary, and treated her with the utmost harshness and severity.



Elizabeth, who was fully informed of all those incidents, seemed touched h compassion towards the unfortunate queen; and all her fears and s being now laid asleep, by the consideration of that ruin and y in which Mary’s conduct had involved her, she began to reflect on e instability of human affairs, the precarious state of royal grandeur, e danger of encouraging rebellious subjects; and she resolved to employ r authority for alleviating the calamities of her unhappy kinswoman. She t Sir Nicholas Throgmorton ambassador to Scotland, in order to e both with Mary and the associated lords; and she gave him s, which, though mixed with some lofty pretensions, were full f that good sense which was so natural to her, and of that generosity h the present interesting conjuncture had called forth. She empowered m to declare[*] in her name to Mary, that the late conduct of that s, so enormous, and in every respect so unjustifiable, had given r the highest offence; and though she felt the movements of pity towards r, she had once determined never to interpose in her affairs, either by e or assistance, but to abandon her entirely, as a person whose n was totally desperate, and honor irretrievable.



That she was well assured that other foreign princes, Mary’s near s, had embraced the same resolution; but, for her part, the late s had touched her heart with more tender sympathy, and had made her t measures more favorable to the liberty and interests of the unhappy n: that she was determined not to see her oppressed by her rebellious s, but would employ all her good offices, and even her power, to m her from captivity, and place her in such a condition as would at e be compatible with her dignity and the safety of her subjects: that e conjured her to lay aside all thoughts of revenge, except against the s of her husband; and as she herself was his near relation, she s better entitled than the subjects of Mary to interpose her authority n that head; and she therefore besought that princess, if she had any d to her own honor and safety, not to oppose so just and reasonable a d: that after those two points were provided for, her own liberty and e punishment of her husband’s assassins, the safety of her infant son s next to be considered; and there seemed no expedient more proper for t purpose, than sending him to be educated in England: and that, s the security which would attend his removal from a scene of n and convulsions, there were many other beneficial consequences, h it was easy to foresee as the result of his education in that y.[*]



The remonstrances which Throgmorton was instructed to make to the d lords, were entirely conformable to these sentiments which Elizabeth entertained in Mary’s favor. She empowered him to tell them, t whatever blame she might throw on Mary’s conduct, any opposition to r sovereign was totally unjustifiable, and incompatible with all order d good government: that it belonged not to them to reform, much less to h, the maleadministration of their prince; and the only arms which s could in any case lawfully employ against the supreme authority, e entreaties, counsels, and representations: that if these expedients d, they were next to appeal by their prayers to Heaven, and to wait h patience till the Almighty, in whose hands are the hearts of princes, d be pleased to turn them to justice and to mercy. That she d not this doctrine because she herself was interested in its e, but because it was universally received in all well-governed s, and was essential to the preservation of civil society: that she d them to restore their queen to liberty; and promised, in that e, to concur with them in all proper expedients for regulating the t, for punishing the king’s murderers, and for guarding the life d liberty of the infant prince: and that, if the services which she had y rendered the Scottish nation, in protecting them from foreign n, were duly considered by them, they would repose confidence in r good offices, and would esteem themselves blameworthy in having o made no application to her.[*]



Elizabeth, besides these remonstrances, sent by Throgmorton some articles f accommodation, which he was to propose to both parties, as expedients r the settlement of public affairs; and though these articles contained e important restraints on the sovereign power, they were in the main d for Mary’s advantage, and were sufficiently indulgent to r.[**] The associated lords, who determined to proceed with greater y, were apprehensive of Elizabeth’s partiality; and being sensible t Mary would take courage from the protection of that powerful s,[***] they thought proper, after several affected delays, to e the English ambassador all access to her. There were four different s proposed in Scotland for the treatment of the captive queen: one, t she should be restored to her authority under very strict s: the second, that she should be obliged to resign her crown to e prince, be banished the kingdom, and be confined either to France or England; with assurances from the sovereign in whose dominions she should e, that she should make no attempts to the disturbance of the d government: the third, that she should be publicly tried for r crimes, of which her enemies pretended to have undoubted proof, and be d to perpetual imprisonment: the fourth was still more severe, and d that, after her trial and condemnation, capital punishment should e inflicted upon her.[****] Throgmorton supported the mildest proposal; t though he promised his mistress’s guaranty for the performance of s, threatened the ruling party with immediate vengeance in case of l,[v] and warned them not to draw on themselves, by their violence, e public reproach which now lay upon their queen, he found that, g Secretary Lidington, he had not the good fortune to convince any f the leaders.



All counsels seemed to tend towards the more severe expedients; and the s, in particular, drawing their examples from the rigorous maxims f the Old Testament, which can only be warranted by particular s, inflamed the minds of the people against their unhappy n.[*]



There were several pretenders to the regency of the young prince after the d deposition of Mary. The earl of Lenox claimed that authority as r to the prince: the duke of Chatelrault, who was absent in France, had pretensions as next heir to the crown: but the greatest number f the associated lords inclined to the earl of Murray, in whose capacity y had entire trust, and who possessed the confidence of the preachers d more zealous reformers. All measures being therefore concerted, three s were sent to Mary, by the hands of Lord Lindesey and Sir Robert Melvil; by one of which she was to resign the crown in favor of her n, by another to appoint Murray regent, by the third to name a council, h should administer the government till his arrival in Scotland. The n of Scots, seeing no prospect of relief, lying justly under s for her life, and believing that no deed which she executed g her captivity could be valid, was prevailed on, after a plentiful n of tears, to sign these three instruments; and she took not the e of inspecting any one of them.[**] In consequence of this forced n, the young prince was proclaimed king, by the name of James VI. He was soon after crowned at Stirling, and the earl of Morton took in s name the coronation oath; in which a promise to extirpate heresy was t forgotten. Some republican pretensions, in favor of the people’s r, were countenanced in this ceremony;[***] and a coin was soon after k, on which the famous saying of Trajan was inscribed, Pro me; si r, in me; “For me; if I deserve it, against me.”[****] Throgmorton d orders from his mistress not to assist at the coronation of the king f Scots.[v]



The council of regency had not long occasion to exercise their authority.

The earl of Murray arrived from France, and took possession of his high e. He paid a visit to the captive queen, and spoke to her in a manner h better suited her past conduct than her present condition. This h treatment quite extinguished in her breast any remains of affection s him.[*] Murray proceeded afterwards to break, in a more public r, all terms of decency with her. He summoned a parliament; and that y, after voting that she was undoubtedly an accomplice in her d’s murder, condemned her to imprisonment, ratified her demission of e crown, and acknowledged her son for king, and Murray for regent.[**]

The regent, a man of vigor and abilities, employed himself successfully in g the kingdom. He bribed Sir James Balfour to surrender the Castle f Edinburgh: he constrained the garrison of Dunbar to open their gates; d he demolished that fortress.



But though every thing thus bore a favorable aspect to the new government, d all men seemed to acquiesce in Murray’s authority, a violent n, however necessary, can never be effected without great s; and it was not likely that, in a country where the t, in its most settled state, possessed a very disjointed y, a new establishment should meet with no interruption or e. Few considerable men of the nation seemed willing to support Mary, so long as Bothwell was present; but the removal of that obnoxious n had altered the sentiments of many. The duke of Chatelrault, g disappointed of the regency, bore no good will to Murray; and the e sentiments were embraced by all his numerous retainers. Several of e nobility, finding that others had taken the lead among the s, formed a faction apart, and opposed the prevailing power; and s their being moved by some remains of duty and affection towards Mary, the malecontent lords, observing every thing carried to extremity t her, were naturally led to embrace her cause, and shelter s under her authority. All who retained any propensity to the Catholic religion were induced to join this party; and even the people in l, though they had formerly either detested Mary’s crimes or blamed r imprudence, were now inclined to compassionate her present situation, d lamented that a person possessed of so many amiable accomplishments, d to such high dignity, should be treated with such extreme y.[***]



Animated by all these motives, many of the principal nobility now s to the queen of Scots, met at Hamilton, and concerted measures r supporting the cause of that princess.



1568.



While these humors were in fermentation, Mary was employed in contrivances r effecting her escape; and she engaged, by her charms and caresses, a g gentleman, George Douglas, brother to the laird of Lochlevin, to t her in that enterprise. She even went so far as to give him hopes f espousing her, after her marriage with Bothwell should be dissolved on e plea of force; and she proposed this expedient to the regent, who d it. Douglas, however, persevered in his endeavors to free her m captivity; and having all opportunities of access to the house, he s at last successful in the undertaking. He conveyed her in disguise o a small boat, and himself rowed her ashore. She hastened to Hamilton; d the news of her arrival in that place being immediately spread abroad, y of the nobility flocked to her with their forces. A bond of n for her defence was signed by the earls of Argyle, Huntley, Eglington, Crawford, Cassilis, Rothes, Montrose, Sutherland, Erroi, nine s, and nine barons, besides many of the most considerable gentry.[*]

And in a few days, an army, to the number of six thousand men, was d under her standard.



Elizabeth was no sooner informed of Mary’s escape, than she discovered her n of persevering in the same generous and friendly measures which e had hitherto pursued. If she had not employed force against the regent g the imprisonment of that princess, she had been chiefly withheld by e fear of pushing him to greater extremities against her;[**] but she d proposed to the court of France an expedient, which, though less t, would have been no less effectual for her service: she desired t France and England should by concert cut off all commerce with the Scots, till they should do justice to their injured sovereign.[***]



She now despatched Leighton into Scotland to offer both her good offices, d the assistance of her forces, to Mary; but as she apprehended the e of French troops into the kingdom, she desired that the y between the queen of Scots and her subjects might by that s be referred entirely to her arbitration, and that no foreign s should be introduced into Scotland.[*]



But Elizabeth had not leisure to exert fully her efforts in favor of Mary.

The regent made haste to assemble forces; and notwithstanding that his y was inferior in number to that of the queen of Scots, he took the d against her. A battle was fought at Langside, near Glasgow, which s entirely decisive in favor of the regent; and though Murray, after his y, stopped the bloodshed, yet was the action followed by a total n of the queen’s party. That unhappy princess fled southwards m the field of battle with great precipitation, and came with a few s to the borders of England. She here deliberated concerning her t measures, which would probably prove so important to her future s or misery. She found it impossible to remain in her own kingdom: e had an aversion, in her present wretched condition, to return into France, where she had formerly appeared with so much splendor; and she was t, besides, provided with a vessel which could safely convey her r: the late generous behavior of Elizabeth made her hope for n, and even assistance, from that quarter;[**] and as the present s from her domestic enemies were the most urgent, she overlooked all r considerations, and embraced the resolution of taking shelter in England. She embarked on board a fishing-boat in Galloway, and landed the e day at Workington, in Cumberland, about thirty miles from Carlisle, e she immediately despatched a messenger to London, notifying her l, desiring leave to visit Elizabeth, and craving her protection, in e of former professions of friendship made her by that princess.



Elizabeth now found herself in a situation when it was become necessary to e some decisive resolution with regard to her treatment of the queen of Scots; and as she had hitherto, contrary to the opinion of Cecil, attended e to the motives of generosity than of policy,[***] she was engaged by t prudent minister to weigh anew all the considerations which occurred n this critical conjuncture.



He represented, that the party which had dethroned Mary, and had at t assumed the government of Scotland, were always attached to the English alliance, and were engaged, by all the motives of religion and of t, to persevere in their connection with Elizabeth: that though Murray and his friends might complain of some unkind usage during their t in England, they would easily forget these grounds of quarrel, n they reflected, that Elizabeth was the only ally on whom they could y rely, and that their own queen, by her attachment to the Catholic h, and by her other connections, excluded them entirely from the p of France, and even from that of Spain: that Mary, on the other d, even before her violent breach with her Protestant subjects, was in t entirely governed by the counsels of the house of Guise, much more d she implicitly comply with their views, when, by her own ill t, the power of that family and of the zealous Catholics was become r sole resource and security: that her pretensions to the English crown d render her a dangerous instrument in their hands; and, were she once e to suppress the Protestants in her own kingdom, she would unite the Scottish and English Catholics, with those of all foreign states, in a y against the religion and government of England; that it d Elizabeth, therefore, to proceed with caution in the design of g her rival to the throne; and to take care, both that this e, if undertaken, should be effected by English forces alone, and t full securities should beforehand be provided for the reformers and e reformation in Scotland: that, above all, it was necessary to guard y the person of that princess; lest, finding this unexpected e in the English friendship, she should suddenly take the resolution f flying into France, and should attempt by foreign force to recover n of her authority: that her desperate fortunes and broken n fitted her for any attempt; and her resentment, when she should d herself thus deserted by the queen, would concur with her ambition d her bigotry, and render her an unrelenting, as well as powerful enemy o the English government: that if she were once abroad, in the hands of g Catholics, the attack on England would appear to her as easy s that on Scotland; and the only method, she must imagine of recovering r native kingdom, would be to acquire that crown to which she would deem f equally entitled: that a neutrality in such interesting s, though it might be pretended, could never, without the most e danger, be upheld by the queen; and the detention of Mary was y requisite whether the power of England were to be employed in her r, or against her: that nothing, indeed, was more becoming a great e than generosity; yet the suggestions of this noble principle could r, without imprudence, be consulted in such delicate circumstances as e in which the queen was at present placed; where her own safety and e interests of her people were intimately concerned in every resolution h she embraced: that though the example of successful rebellion, y in a neighboring country, could nowise be agreeable to any n, yet Mary’s imprudence had been so great, perhaps her crimes so s, that the insurrection of subjects, after such provocation, could o longer be regarded as a precedent against other princes: that it was t necessary for Elizabeth to ascertain, in a regular and satisfactory r, the extent of Mary’s guilt, and thence to determine the degree of n which she ought to afford her against her discontented s: that as no glory could surpass that of defending oppressed e, it was equally infamous to patronize vice and murder on the e; and the contagion of such dishonor would extend itself to all who d or supported it: and that if the crimes of the Scottish s should, on inquiry, appear as great and certain as was affirmed d believed, every measure against her, which policy should dictate, d thence be justified; or if she should be found innocent, every e which friendship should inspire would be acknowledged laudable d glorious.



Agreeably to these views, Elizabeth resolved to proceed in a seemingly s, but really cautious manner with the queen of Scots; and she y sent orders to Lady Scrope, sister to the duke of Norfolk, a y who lived in the neighborhood, to attend on that princess. Soon r, she despatched to her Lord Scrope himself, warden of the marches, d Sir Francis Knolles, vice-chamberlain. They found Mary already lodged n the Castle of Carlisle; and after expressing the queen’s sympathy with r in her late misfortunes, they told her, that her request of being d to visit their sovereign, and of being admitted to her presence, d not at present be complied with: till she had cleared herself of her d’s murder, of which she was so strongly accused, Elizabeth could t without dishonor show her any countenance, or appear indifferent to e assassination of so near a kinsman.[*]



So unexpected a check threw Mary into tears: and the necessity of her n extorted from her a declaration, that she would willingly y herself to her sister from all imputations, and would submit her e to the arbitration of so good a friend.[*] Two days after, she sent Lord Herreis to London with a letter to the same purpose.



This concession, which Mary could scarcely avoid without an acknowledgment f guilt, was the point expected and desired by Elizabeth: she immediately d Midlemore to the regent of Scotland; requiring him both to t from the further prosecution of his queen’s party, and to send some s to London to justify his conduct with regard to her. Murray might y be startled at receiving a message so violent and imperious; but as s domestic enemies were numerous and powerful, and England was the sole y which he could expect among foreign nations, he was resolved rather o digest the affront, than provoke Elizabeth by a refusal. He also d, that though that queen had hitherto appeared partial to Mary, y political motives evidently engaged her to support the king’s cause n Scotland; and it was not to be doubted but so penetrating a princess d in the end discover this interest, and would at least afford him a t and equitable hearing. He therefore replied, that he would himself e a journey to England, attended by other commissioners, and would y submit the determination of his cause to Elizabeth.[**]



Lord Herreis now perceived that his mistress had advanced too far in her s: he endeavored to maintain, that Mary could not, without n of her royal dignity, submit to a contest with her rebellious s before a foreign prince: and he required either present aid from England, or liberty for his queen to pass over into France. Being pressed, r, with the former agreement before the English council, he again d his consent; but in a few days he began anew to recoil; and it was h some difficulty that he was brought to acquiesce in the first n.[***] These fluctuations, which were incessantly renewed, d his visible reluctance to the measures pursued by the court of England.



The queen of Scots discovered no less aversion to the trial proposed; and t required all the artifice and prudence of Elizabeth to make her e in the agreement to which she had at first consented. This r princess still said to her, that she desired not without Mary’s t and approbation to enter into the question, and pretended only as a friend to hear her justification: that she was confident there would be d no difficulty in refuting all the calumnies of her enemies; and even f her apology should fall short of full conviction, Elizabeth was d to support her cause, and procure her some reasonable terms of n; and that it was never meant, that she should be cited to a l on the accusation of her rebellious subjects; but, on the contrary, t they should be summoned to appear, and to justify themselves for r conduct towards her.[*] Allured by these plausible professions, the n of Scots agreed to vindicate herself by her own commissioners, e commissioners appointed by Elizabeth.



During these transactions, Lord Scrope and Sir Francis Knolles, who d with Mary at Carlisle, had leisure to study her character, and to e report of it to Elizabeth. Unbroken by her misfortunes, resolute in r purpose, active in her enterprises, she aspired to nothing but y; and was determined to endure any extremity, to undergo any y, and to try every fortune, rather than abandon her cause, or d the superiority to her enemies. Eloquent, insinuating, affable, she d already convinced all those who approached her, of the innocence of r past conduct; and as she declared her fixed purpose to require aid of r friends all over Europe, and even to have recourse to infidels and s, rather than fail of vengeance against her persecutors, it was y to foresee the danger to which her charms, her spirit, her address, f allowed to operate with their full force, would expose them.[**] The t of England, therefore, who, under pretence of guarding her, had y in effect detained her prisoner, were determined to watch her with l greater vigilance. As Carlisle, by its situation on the borders, d her great opportunities of contriving her escape, they removed r to Bolton, a seat of Lord Scrope’s in Yorkshire; and the issue of the y between her and the Scottish nation was regarded as a subject e momentous to Elizabeth’s security and interests than it had hitherto n apprehended.



The Commissioners appointed by the English court for the examination of s great cause, were the duke of Norfolk, the earl of Sussex, and Sir Ralph Sadler; and York was named as the place of conference. Lesley, p of Ross, the lords Herreis, Levingstone, and Boyde, with three s more, appeared as commissioners from the queen of Scots. The earl f Murray, regent, the earl of Morton, the bishop of Orkney, Lord Lindesey, and the abbot of Dunfermling were appointed commissioners from e king and kingdom of Scotland. Secretary Lidington, George Buchanan, e famous poet and historian, with some others, were named as their s.



It was a great circumstance in Elizabeth’s glory, that she was thus chosen e between the factions of a neighboring kingdom, which had during y centuries entertained the most violent jealousy and animosity against England; and her felicity was equally rare, in having the fortunes and e of so dangerous a rival, who had long given her the greatest e, now entirely at her disposal. Some circumstances of her late t had discovered a bias towards the side of Mary: her prevailing s led her to favor the enemies of that princess: the professions f impartiality which she had made were open and frequent; and she had so r succeeded, that each side accused her commissioners of partiality s their adversaries.[*] She herself appears, by the instructions n them, to have fixed no plan for the decision; but she knew that the s which she should reap must be great, whatever issue the cause t take. If Mary’s crimes could be ascertained by undoubted proof, she d forever blast the reputation of that princess, and might justifiably n her forever a prisoner in England: if the evidence fell short of n, it was intended to restore her to the throne, but with such t limitations, as would leave Elizabeth perpetual arbiter of all s between the parties in Scotland, and render her in effect e mistress of the kingdom.[**]



Mary’s commissioners, before they gave in their complaint, against her s in Scotland, entered a protest, that their appearance in the cause d nowise affect the independence of her crown, or be construed as a k of subordination to England: the English commissioners received this t, but with a reserve to the claim of England. The complaint of that s was next read, and contained a detail of the injuries which she d suffered since her marriage with Bothwell: that her subjects had taken s against her, on pretence of freeing her from captivity; that when she t herself into their hands, they had committed her to close custody in Lochlevin; had placed her son, an infant, on her throne; had again taken s against her after her deliverance from prison; had rejected all her s for accommodation, had given battle to her troops; and had d her, for the safety of her person, to take shelter in England.[*]

The earl of Murray, in answer to this complaint, gave a summary and t account of the late transactions: that the earl of Bothwell, the n murderer of the late king, had, a little after committing that e, seized the person of the queen and led her to Dunbar; that he d such influence over her as to gain her consent to marry him, and e had accordingly procured a divorce from his former wife, and had d to celebrate his nuptials with the queen; that the scandal of s transaction, the dishonor which it brought on the nation, the danger o which the infant prince was exposed from the attempts of that audacious n, had obliged the nobility to take arms, and oppose his criminal s; that after Mary, in order to save him, had thrown herself o their hands, she still discovered such a violent attachment to him, t they found it necessary, for their own and the public safety, to e her person during a season, till Bothwell and the other murderers f her husband could be tried and punished for their crimes; and that g this confinement she had voluntarily, without compulsion or e, merely from disgust at the inquietude and vexations attending r, resigned her crown to her only son, and had appointed the earl of Murray regent during the minority.[**]



The queen’s answer to this apology was obvious: that she did not know, and r could suspect, that Bothwell, who had been acquitted by a jury, and d to her by all the nobility for her husband, was the murderer f the king; that she ever was, and still continues desirous, that, if he e guilty, he may be brought to condign punishment; that her resignation f the crown was extorted from her by the well-grounded fears of her life, d even by direct menaces of violence; and that Throgmorton, the English r, as well as others of her friends, had advised her to sign that r, as the only means of saving herself from the last extremity, and d assured her, that a consent, given under these circumstances, could r have any validity.[*]



So far the queen of Scots seemed plainly to have the advantage in the t; and the English commissioners might have been surprised that Murray had made so weak a defence, and had suppressed all the material s against that princess, on which his party had ever so y insisted, had not some private conferences previously informed m of the secret. Mary’s commissioners had boasted that Elizabeth, from d to her kinswoman, and from her desire of maintaining the rights of s, was determined, how criminal soever the conduct of that s might appear, to restore her to the throne;[**] and Murray, g on some past measures of the English court, began to apprehend t there were but too just grounds for these expectations. He believed t Mary, if he would agree to conceal the most violent part of the n against her, would submit to any reasonable terms of n; but if he once proceeded so far as to charge her with the e of her guilt, no composition could afterwards take place; and should e ever be restored, either by the power of Elizabeth or the assistance f her other friends, he and his party must be exposed to her severe and e vengeance.[***] He resolved, therefore, not to venture rashly n a measure which it would be impossible for him ever to recall; and he y paid a visit to Norfolk and the other English commissioners, d his scruples, laid before them the evidence of the queen’s t, and desired to have some security for Elizabeth’s protection, in e that evidence should, upon examination, appear entirely satisfactory.

Norfolk was not secretly displeased with these scruples of the t.[****]



He had ever been a partisan of the queen of Scots. Secretary Lidington, o began also to incline to that party, and was a man of singular address d capacity, had engaged him to embrace further views in her favor, and n to think of espousing her: and though that duke confessed[*] that the s against Mary seemed to him unquestionable, he encouraged Murray in s present resolution, not to produce them publicly in the conferences e the English commissioners.[**]



Norfolk, however, was obliged to transmit to court the queries proposed by e regent. These queries consisted of four particulars: Whether the English commissioners had authority from their sovereign to pronounce e against Mary, in case her guilt should be fully proved before m? Whether they would promise to exercise that authority, and proceed o an actual sentence? Whether the queen of Scots, if she were found y, should be delivered into the hands of the regent, or, at least, be o secured in England, that she never should be able to disturb the y of Scotland? and, Whether Elizabeth would also, in that case, e to acknowledge the young king, and protect the regent in his y?[***]



Elizabeth, when these queries, with the other transactions, were laid e her, began to think that they pointed towards a conclusion more e and more advantageous than she had hitherto expected. She d therefore to bring the matter into full light; and, under t that the distance from her person retarded the proceedings of her s, she ordered them to come to London, and there continue the s. On their appearance, she immediately joined in commission h them some of the most considerable of her council; Sir Nicholas Bacon, lord keeper, the earls of Arundel and Leicester, Lord Clinton, l, and Sir William Cecil, secretary.[****] The queen of Scots, who w nothing of these secret motives, and who expected that fear or y would still restrain Murray from proceeding to any violent n against her, expressed an entire satisfaction in this t; and declared that the affair, being under the immediate n of Elizabeth, was now in the hands where she most desired to t it.[v].



The conferences were accordingly continued at Hampton Court; and Mary’s s, as before, made no scruple to be present at them.



The queen, meanwhile, gave a satisfactory answer to all Murray’s demands; d declared that, though she wished and hoped from the present inquiry to e entirely convinced of Mary’s innocence, yet if the event should prove y, and if that princess should appear guilty of her husband’s r, she should, for her own part, deem her ever after unworthy of a e.[*] The regent, encouraged by this declaration, opened more fully s charge against the queen of Scots; and after expressing his reluctance o proceed to that extremity, and protesting that nothing but the y of self-defence, which must not be abandoned for any delicacy, d have engaged him in such a measure, he proceeded to accuse her in n terms of participation and consent in the assassination of the g.[**] The earl of Lenox too appeared before the English commissioners, d, imploring vengeance for the murder of his son, accused Mary as an e with Bothwell in that enormity.[***]



When this charge was so unexpectedly given in, and copies of it were d to the bishop of Ross, Lord Herreis, and the other s of Mary, they absolutely refused to return an answer; and y grounded their silence on very extraordinary reasons: they had s, they said, from their mistress, if any thing were advanced that t touch her honor, not to make any defence, as she was a sovereign s, and could not be subject to any tribunal; and they required that e should previously be admitted to Elizabeth’s presence, to whom, and to m alone, she was determined to justify her innocence.[****]



They forgot that the conferences were at first begun, and were still d, with no other view than to clear her from the accusations of r enemies; that Elizabeth had ever pretended to enter into them only as r friend, by her own consent and approbation, not as assuming any n over her; that this princess had from the beginning refused o admit her to her presence, till she should vindicate herself from the s imputed to her; that she had therefore discovered no new signs of y by her perseverance in that resolution; and that though she had d an audience to the earl of Murray and his colleagues, she had y conferred the same honor on Mary’s commissioners;[*] and her t was so far entirely equal to both parties.[**] 11


As the commissioners of the queen of Scots refused to give in any answer o Murray’s charge, the necessary consequence seemed to be, that there d be no further proceedings in the conference. But though this silence t be interpreted as a presumption against her, it did not fully answer e purpose of those English ministers who were enemies to that princess.

They still desired to have in their hands the proofs of her guilt; and in r to draw them with decency from the regent, a judicious artifice was d by Elizabeth. Murray was called before the English commissioners, d reproved by them, in the queen’s name, for the atrocious imputations h he had the temerity to throw upon his sovereign; but though the earl f Murray, they added, and the other commissioners, had so far forgotten e duty of allegiance to their prince, the queen never would overlook t she owed to her friend, her neighbor, and her kinswoman; and she e desired to know what they could say in their own n.[***] Murray, thus urged, made no difficulty in producing e proofs of his charge against the queen of Scots; and among the rest, e love-letters and sonnets of hers to Bothwell, written all in her own d, and two other papers, one written in her own hand, another d by her, and written by the earl of Huntley; each of which d a promise of marriage with Bothwell, made before the pretended l and acquittal of that nobleman.



All these important papers had been kept by Bothwell in a silver box or t, which had been given him by Mary, and which had belonged to her t husband, Francis; and though the princess had enjoined him to burn e letters as soon as he had read them, he had thought proper carefully o preserve them, as pledges of her fidelity, and had committed them to e custody of Sir James Balfour, deputy governor of the Castle of Edinburgh. When that fortress was besieged by the associated lords, Bothwell sent a servant to receive the casket from the hands of the deputy r. Balfour delivered it to the messenger; but as he had at that e received some disgust from Bothwell, and was secretly negotiating an t with the ruling party, he took care, by conveying private e to the earl of Morton, to make the papers be intercepted by m, They contained incontestable proofs of Mary’s criminal correspondence h Bothwell, of her consent to the king’s murder, and of her concurrence n the violence which Bothwell pretended to commit upon her.[*] Murray d this evidence by some testimonies of corresponding facts;[**] d he added, some time after, the dying confession of one Hubert, or French Paris, as he was called, a servant of Bothwell’s, who had been d for the king’s murder, and who directly charged the queen with r being accessory to that criminal enterprise.[***]



Mary’s commissioners had used every expedient to ward this blow, which y saw coming upon them, and against which, it appears, they were not d with any proper defence. As soon as Murray opened his charge, y endeavored to turn the conferences from an inquiry into a n; and though informed by the English commissioners, that g could be more dishonorable for their mistress, than to enter into a treaty with such undutiful subjects, before she had justified herself m those enormous imputations which had been thrown upon her, they still d that Elizabeth should settle terms of accommodation between Mary d her enemies in Scotland.[****] They maintained, that till their s had given in her answer to Murray’s charge, his proofs could r be called for nor produced:[v] and finding that the English s were still determined to proceed in the method which had n projected, they finally broke off the conferences, and never would e any reply.



These papers, at least translations of them, have since been published.

The objections made to their authenticity are in general of small force: t were they ever so specious, they cannot now be hearkened to; since Mary, at the time when the truth could have been fully cleared, did in t ratify the evidence against her, by recoiling from the inquiry at e very critical moment, and refusing to give an answer to the accusation f her enemies.[*] 12


But Elizabeth, though she had seen enough for her own satisfaction, was d that the most eminent persons of her court should also be d with these transactions, and should be convinced of the equity f her proceedings. She ordered her privy council to be assembled; and, t she might render the matter more solemn and authentic, she summoned g with them the earls of Northumberland, Westmoreland, Shrewsbury, Worcester, Huntingdon, and Warwick. All the proceedings of the English s were read to them: the evidences produced by Murray were d: a great number of letters written by Mary to Elizabeth were laid e them, and the handwriting compared with that of the letters d in by the regent: the refusal of the queen of Scots’ s to make any reply was related: and on the whole, Elizabeth d them, that as she had from the first thought it improper that Mary, r such horrid crimes were imputed to her, should be admitted to her e, before she had in some measure justified herself from the e, so now, when her guilt was confirmed by so many evidences, and all r refused, she must, for her part, persevere more steadily in that n.[**] Elizabeth next called in the queen of Scots’ s; and after observing, that she deemed it much more decent r their mistress to continue the conferences, than to require the y of justifying herself in person, she told them, that Mary might r send her reply by a person whom she trusted, or deliver it herself o some English nobleman, whom Elizabeth should appoint to wait upon her: t as to her resolution of making no reply at all, she must regard it as e strongest confession of guilt, nor could they ever be deemed her s who advised her to that method of proceeding.[***] These topics e enforced still more strongly in a letter which she wrote to Mary f.[****]



The queen of Scots had no other subterfuge from these pressing s, than still to demand a personal interview with Elizabeth: a n which, she was sensible, would never be granted;[*] because Elizabeth knew that this expedient could decide nothing; because it t matters to extremity, which that princess desired to avoid; and e it had been refused from the beginning, even before the t of the conferences. In order to keep herself better in e, Mary thought of another device. Though the conferences were n off, she ordered her commissioners to accuse the earl of Murray and s associates as the murderers of the king:[**] but this accusation, g so late, being extorted merely by a complaint of Murray’s, and g unsupported by any proof, could only be regarded as an angry n upon her enemy.[***] 13 She also desired to have s of the papers given in by the regent; but as she still persisted in r resolution to make no reply before the English commissioners, this d was finally refused her.[****] 14


As Mary had thus put an end to the conferences, the regent expressed great e to return into Scotland; and he complained, that his enemies d taken advantage of his absence, and had thrown the whole government o confusion. Elizabeth therefore dismissed him; and granted him a loan f five thousand pounds, to bear the charges of his journey.[*] During the s at York, the duke of Chatelrault arrived at London, in passing m France; and as the queen knew that he was engaged in Mary’s party, d had very plausible pretensions to the regency of the king of Scots, e thought proper to detain him till after Murray’s departure. But g these marks of favor, and some other assistance which she y gave this latter nobleman,[**] she still declined acknowledging e young king, or treating with Murray as regent of Scotland.



Orders were given for removing the queen of Scots from Bolton, a place d with Catholics, to Tutbury, in the county of Stafford, where e was put under the custody of the earl of Shrewsbury. Elizabeth d hopes that this princess, discouraged by her misfortunes, and d by the late transactions, would be glad to secure a safe t from all the tempests with which she had been agitated; and she d to bury every thing in oblivion, provided Mary would agree, r voluntary to resign her crown, or to associate her son with her in e government; and the administration to remain, during his minority, in e hands of the earl of Murray.[*] But that high-spirited princess d all treaty upon such terms, and declared that her last words d be those of a queen of Scotland. Besides many other reasons, she d, which fixed her in that resolution, she knew, that if in the present e she made such concessions, her submission would be universally d an acknowledgment of guilt, and would ratify all the calumnies of r enemies.[**]



Mary still insisted upon this alternative; either that Elizabeth should t her in recovering her authority, or should give her liberty to e into France, and make trial of the friendship of other princes: and s she asserted, that she had come voluntarily into England, invited by y former professions of amity, she thought that one or other of these s could not, without the most extreme injustice, be refused her.

But Elizabeth, sensible of the danger which attended both these proposals, s secretly resolved to detain her still a captive; and as her retreat o England had been little voluntary, her claim upon the queen’s y appeared much less urgent than she was willing to pretend.

Necessity, it was thought, would to the prudent justify her detention: her t misconduct would apologize for it to the equitable: and though it was n, that compassion for Mary’s situation, joined to her intrigues d insinuating behavior, would, while she remained in England, excite the l of her friends, especially of the Catholics, these inconveniences e deemed much inferior to those which attended any other expedient.

Elizabeth trusted also to her own address, for eluding all these s: she purposed to avoid breaking absolutely with the queen of Scots, to keep her always in hopes of an accommodation, to negotiate y with her, and still to throw the blame of not coming to any n, either on unforeseen accidents, or on the obstinacy and s of others.



We come now to mention some English affairs which we left behind us, that e might not interrupt our narrative of the events in Scotland, which d so material a part of the present reign. The term fixed by the y of Chateau-Cambresis for the restitution of Calais, expired in

1567; and Elizabeth, after making her demand at the gates of that city, t Sir Thomas Smith to Paris; and that minister, in conjunction with Sir Henry Norris, her resident ambassador, enforced her pretensions.

Conferences were held on that head, without coming to any conclusion y to the English. The chancellor, De L’Hospital, told the English ambassadors, that though France by an article of the treaty was d to restore Calais on the expiration of eight years, there was r article of the same treaty, which now deprived Elizabeth of any t that could accrue to her by that engagement; that it was agreed, if e English should, during the interval, commit hostilities upon France, y should instantly forfeit all claim to Calais; and the taking n of Havre and Dieppe, with whatever pretences that measure might e covered, was a plain violation of the peace between the nations: that h these places were not entered by force, but put into Elizabeth’s s by the governors, these governors were rebels; and a correspondence h such traitors was the most flagrant injury that could be committed on y sovereign: that in the treaty which ensued upon the expulsion of the English from Normandy, the French ministers had absolutely refused to make y mention of Calais, and had thereby declared their intention to take e of the title which had accrued to the crown of France: and that h a general clause had been inserted, implying a reservation of all s, this concession could not avail the English, who at that time d no just claim to Calais, and had previously forfeited all right o that fortress.[*] The queen was nowise surprised at hearing these s; and as she knew that the French court intended not from the t to make restitution, much less after they could justify their l by such plausible reasons, she thought it better for the present o acquiesce in the loss, than to pursue a doubtful title by a war both s and expensive, as well as unseasonable.[**]



Elizabeth entered anew into negotiations for espousing the archduke Charles; and she seems, at this time, to have had no great motive of y which might induce her to make this fallacious offer: but as she s very rigorous in the terms insisted on, and would not agree that the e, if he espoused her, should enjoy any power or title in England, d even refused him the exercise of his religion, the treaty came to g; and that prince, despairing of success in his addresses, married e daughter of Albert, duke of Bavaria.[*]









1568.



Of all the European churches which shook off the yoke of papal authority, o one proceeded with so much reason and moderation as the church of England; an advantage which had been derived partly from the interposition f the civil magistrate in this innovation, partly from the gradual and w steps by which the reformation was conducted in that kingdom. Rage d animosity against the Catholic religion was as little indulged as d be supposed in such a revolution: the fabric of the secular y was maintained entire: the ancient liturgy was preserved, so far s was thought consistent with the new principles: many ceremonies, become e from age and preceding use were retained: the splendor of the Romish worship, though removed, had at least given place to order and y: the distinctive habits of the clergy, according to their t ranks, were continued: no innovation was admitted merely from e and opposition to former usage: and the new religion, by mitigating e genius of the ancient superstition, and rendering it more compatible h the peace and interests of society, had preserved itself in that y medium which wise men have always sought, and which the people have o seldom been able to maintain.



But though such in general was the spirit of the reformation in that y, many of the English reformers, being men of more warm complexions d more obstinate tempers, endeavored to push matters to extremities t the church of Rome, and indulged themselves in the most violent y and antipathy to all former practices. Among these, Hooper, o afterwards suffered for his religion with such extraordinary y, was chiefly distinguished. This man was appointed, during the n of Edward, to the see of Glocester, and made no scruple of accepting e episcopal office; but he refused to be consecrated in the episcopal t, the cymar and rochet, which had formerly, he said, been abused to n, and which were thereby rendered unbecoming a true Christian.

Cranmer and Ridley were surprised at this objection, which opposed the d practice, and even the established laws; and though young Edward, s of promoting a man so celebrated for his eloquence, his zeal, and s morals, enjoined them to dispense with this ceremony, they were still d to retain it. Hooper then embraced the resolution, rather to e the bishopric than clothe himself in those hated garments; but it s deemed requisite that, for the sake of the example, he should not e so easily. He was first confined to Cranmer’s house, then thrown o prison, till he should consent to be a bishop on the terms proposed: e was plied with conferences, and reprimands, and arguments: Bucer and Peter Martyr, and the most celebrated foreign reformers, were consulted on s important question: and a compromise, with great difficulty, was at t made, that Hooper should not be obliged to wear commonly the s robes, but should agree to be consecrated in them, and to use m during cathedral service;[*] a condescension not a little y in a man of so inflexible a spirit as this reformer.



The same objection which had arisen with regard to the episcopal habit, d been moved against the raiment of the inferior clergy; and the e in particular, with the tippet and corner cap, was a great object f abhorrence to many of the popular zealots.[**]



In vain was it urged, that particular habits, as well as postures and s, having been constantly used by the clergy, and employed in s service, acquire a veneration in the eyes of the people, appear d in their apprehensions, excite their devotion, and contract a kind f mysterious virtue, which attaches the affections of men to the national d established worship: that in order to produce this effect, a y in these particulars is requisite, and even a perseverance, as r as possible, in the former practice: and that the nation would be y, if, by retaining these inoffensive observances, the reformers could e the people to renounce willingly what was absurd or pernicious in e ancient superstition. These arguments, which had influence with wise n, were the very reasons which engaged the violent Protestants to reject e habits. They pushed matters to a total opposition with the church of Rome; every compliance, they said, was a symbolizing with Antichrist.[*]

And this spirit was carried so far by some reformers, that, in a national e, made afterwards by the church of Scotland against these s, it was asked, “What has Christ Jesus to do with Belial? What has s to do with light? If surplices, corner caps, and tippets have n badges cf idolaters in the very act of their idolatry, why should the r of Christian liberty, and the open rebuker of all superstition, e with the dregs of the Romish beast? Yea, who is there that ought t rather to be afraid of taking in his hand, or on his forehead, the t and mark of that odious beast?”[**] But this application was d by the English church.



There was only one instance in which the spirit of contradiction to the Romanists took place universally in England: the altar was removed from e wall, was placed in the middle of the church, and was thenceforth d the communion table. The reason why this innovation met with h general reception was, that the nobility and gentry got thereby a e for making spoil of the plate, vestures, and rich ornaments which d to the altars.[***]



These disputes, which had been started during the reign of Edward, were d abroad by the Protestants who fled from the persecutions of Mary; d as the zeal of these men had received an increase from the furious y of their enemies, they were generally inclined to carry their n to the utmost extremity against the practices of the church of Rome. Their communication with Calvin, and the other reformers who d the discipline and worship of Geneva, confirmed them in this e reluctance; and though some of the refugees, particularly those o were established at Frankfort, still adhered to King Edward’s liturgy, e prevailing spirit carried these confessors to seek a still further n. On the accession of Elizabeth, they returned to their native y; and being regarded with general veneration, on account of their l and past sufferings, they ventured to insist on the establishment of r projected model; nor did they want countenance from many e persona in the queen’s council. But the princess herself, so r from being willing to despoil religion of the few ornaments and s which remained in it, was rather inclined to bring the public p still nearer to the Romish ritual;[*] and she thought that the n had already gone too far in shaking off those forms and s, which, without distracting men of more refined apprehensions, d, in a very innocent manner, to allure, and amuse, and engage the r.



She took care to have a law for uniformity strictly enacted: she was d by the parliament to add any new ceremonies which she thought r: and though she was sparing in the exercise of this prerogative, e continued rigid in exacting an observance of the established laws, and n punishing all nonconformity. The zealots, therefore, who harbored a t antipathy to the Episcopal order, and to the whole liturgy, were d, in a great measure, to conceal these sentiments, which would have n regarded as highly audacious and criminal; and they confined their d objections to the surplice, the confirmation of children, the sign f the cross in baptism, the ring in marriage, kneeling at the sacrament, d bowing at the name of Jesus. So fruitless is it for sovereigns to h with a rigid care over orthodoxy, and to employ the sword in s controversy, that the work, perpetually renewed, is perpetually o begin; and a garb, a gesture, nay, a metaphysical or grammatical n, when rendered important by the disputes of theologians and e zeal of the magistrate, is sufficient to destroy the unity of the h, and even the peace of society. These controversies had already d such ferment among the people, that in some places, they refused o frequent the churches where the habits and ceremonies were used; would t salute the conforming clergy; and proceeded so far as to revile them n the streets, to spit in their faces, and to use them with all manner of y.[*] And while the sovereign authority checked these excesses, e flame was confined, not extinguished; and burning fiercer from t, it burst out in the succeeding reigns to the destruction of e church and monarchy.



All enthusiasts, indulging themselves in rapturous flights ecstasies, s, inspirations, have a natural aversion to episcopal authority, to s, rites, and forms which they denominate superstition, or y elements, and which seem to restrain the liberal effusions of r zeal and devotion: but there was another set of opinions adopted by e innovators, which rendered them in a peculiar manner the object of Elizabeth’s aversion. The same bold and daring spirit which accompanied m in their addresses to the Divinity, appeared in their political s; and the principles of civil liberty, which during some s had been little avowed in the nation, and which were totally e with the present exorbitant prerogative, had been strongly d by this new sect. Scarcely any sovereign before Elizabeth, and e after her, carried higher, both in speculation and practice, the y of the crown; and the Puritans (so these sectaries were called, n account of their pretending to a superior purity of worship and e) could not recommend themselves worse to her favor, than by g the doctrine of resisting or restraining princes. From all e motives, the queen neglected no opportunity of depressing those s innovators; and while they were secretly countenanced by some of r most favored ministers, Cecil, Leicester, Knolles, Bedford, Walsingham, she never was, to the end of her life, reconciled to their s and practices.



We have thought proper to insert in this place an account of the rise and e genius of the Puritans; because Camden marks the present year as the d when they began to make themselves considerable in England. We now n to our narration.



1569.



The duke of Norfolk was the only peer that enjoyed the highest title of y; and as there were at present no princes of the blood, the r of his family, the opulence of his fortune, and the extent of his e, had rendered him, without comparison, the first subject in England. The qualities of his mind corresponded to his high station:—beneficent, e, generous, he had acquired the affections of the people; prudent, e, obsequious, he possessed, without giving her any jealousy, the d graces of his sovereign. His grandfather and father had long been d as the leaders of the Catholics; and this hereditary attachment, d to the alliance of blood, had procured him the friendship of the t considerable men of that party; but as he had been educated among the s, was sincerely devoted to their principles, and maintained that t decorum and regularity of life by which the Protestants were at t time distinguished, he thereby enjoyed the rare felicity of being r even with the most opposite factions. The height of his prosperity e was the source of his misfortunes, and engaged him in attempts from h his virtue and prudence would naturally have forever kept him at a e.



Norfolk was at this time a widower; and being of a suitable age, his e with the queen of Scots had appeared so natural, that it occurred o several of his friends and those of that princess: but the first person o, after Secretary Lidington, opened the scheme to the duke, is said to e been the earl of Murray, before his departure for Scotland.[*] That n set before Norfolk, both the advantage of composing the s in Scotland by an alliance which would be so generally e, and the prospect of reaping the succession of England; and in r to bind Norfolk’s interest the faster with Mary’s, he proposed that e duke’s daughter should also espouse the young king of Scotland. The y obtaining of Elizabeth’s consent was regarded, both by Murray d Norfolk, as a circumstance essential to the success of their project; d all terms being adjusted between them, Murray took care, by means of Sir Robert Melvil, to have the design communicated to the queen of Scots.

This princess replied, that the vexations which she had met with in her o last marriages, had made her more inclined to lead a single life; but e was determined to sacrifice her own inclinations to the public e: and therefore, as soon as she should be legally divorced from Bothwell, she would be determined by the opinion of her nobility and e in the choice of another husband.[**]



It is probable that Murray was not sincere in this proposal. He had two s to engage him to dissimulation. Heknew the danger which he must n in his return through the north of England, from the power of the s of Northumberland and Westmoreland, Mary’s partisans in that y; and he dreaded an insurrection in Scotland from the duke of Chatelrault and the earls of Argyle and Huntley, whom she had appointed r lieutenants during her absence. By these feigned appearances of p, he both engaged Norfolk to write in his favor to the northern n,[*] and he persuaded the queen of Scots to give her lieutenants n, and even advice, to conclude a cessation of hostilities with e regent’s party.[**]



The duke of Norfolk, though he had agreed that Elizabeth’s consent should e previously obtained before the completion of his marriage, had reason o apprehend that he never should prevail with her voluntarily to make t concession. He knew her perpetual and unrelenting jealousy against r heir and rival; he was acquainted with her former reluctance to all s of marriage with the queen of Scots; he foresaw that this s’s espousing a person of his power, and character, and interest, d give the greatest umbrage; and as it would then become necessary to e her in possession of her throne on some tolerable terms, and n to endeavor the reÃ«stablishing of her character, he dreaded lest Elizabeth, whose politics had now taken a different turn, would never e to such indulgent and generous conditions. He therefore attempted y to gain the consent and approbation of several of the most e nobility; and he was successful with the earls of Pembroke, Arundel, Derby, Bedford, Shrewsbury, Southampton, Northumberland, Westmoreland, Sussex.[***] Lord Lumley and Sir Nicholas Throgmorton y embraced the proposal: even the earl of Leicester, Elizabeth’s d favorite, who had formerly entertained some views of espousing Mary, willingly resigned all his pretensions, and seemed to enter y into Norfolk’s interests.[****] There were other motives, s affection to the duke, which produced this general combination of e nobility.



Sir William Cecil, secretary of state, was the most vigilant, active, and t minister ever known in England; and as he was governed by no views t the interests of his sovereign which he had inflexibly pursued, his y over her became every day more predominant. Ever cool himself, d uninfluenced by prejudice or affection, he checked those sallies of n, and sometimes of caprice, to which she was subject; and if he d of persuading her in the first movement, his perseverance, and s, and arguments were sure at last to recommend themselves to r sound discernment. The more credit he gained with his mistress, the e was he exposed to the envy of her other counsellors; and as he had n supposed to adopt the interests of the house of Suffolk, whose claim d to carry with it no danger to the present establishment, his s, in opposition to him, were naturally led to attach themselves to e queen of Scots. Elizabeth saw without uneasiness this emulation among r courtiers, which served to augment her own authority: and though she d Cecil whenever matters came to extremities, and dissipated every y against him, particularly one laid about this time for having m thrown into the Tower on some pretence or other,[*] she never gave him h unlimited confidence as might enable him entirely to crush his s.



Norfolk, sensible of the difficulty which he must meet with in controlling Cecil’s counsels, especially where they concurred with the inclination as l as interest of the queen, durst not open to her his intentions of g the queen of Scots, but proceeded still in the same course of g his interest in the kingdom, and engaging more of the nobility o take part in his measures. A letter was written to Mary by Leicester, d signed by several of the first rank, recommending Norfolk for her d, and stipulating conditions for the advantage of both kingdoms; y, that she should give sufficient surety to Elizabeth, and the s of her body, for the free enjoyment of the crown of England, that a l league, offensive and defensive, should be made between their s and subjects; that the Protestant religion should be established by w in Scotland; and that she should grant an amnesty to her rebels in t kingdom.[**]



When Mary returned a favorable answer to this application, Norfolk d himself with new ardor in the execution of his project; and s securing the interests of many of the considerable gentry and y who resided at court, he wrote letters to such as lived at their y seats, and possessed the greatest authority in the several s.[*] The kings of France and Spain, who interested themselves y in Mary’s cause, were secretly consulted, and expressed their n of these measures.[**] And though Elizabeth’s consent was s supposed as a previous condition to the finishing of this alliance, t was apparently Norfolk’s intention, when he proceeded such lengths t consulting her, to render his party so strong, that it should no r be in her power to refuse it.[***]



It was impossible that so extensive a conspiracy could entirely escape the n’s vigilance and that of Cecil. She dropped several intimations to e duke, by which he might learn that she was acquainted with his s; and she frequently warned him to beware on what pillow he reposed s head:[****] but he never had the prudence or the courage to open to r his full intentions. Certain intelligence of this dangerous n was given her first by Leicester, then by Murray,[v] who, if r he was sincere in promoting Norfolk’s marriage, which is much to be d, had at least intended for his own safety and that of his party, t Elizabeth should in reality, as well as in appearance, be entire r of the conditions, and should not have her consent extorted by any y of her own subjects. This information gave great alarm to the t of England; and the more so, as those intrigues were attended with r circumstances, of which, it is probable, Elizabeth was not wholly t.



Among the nobility and gentry that seemed to enter into Norfolk’s views, e were many who were zealously attached to the Catholic religion, who d no other design than that of restoring Mary to her liberty, and who d gladly, by a combination with foreign powers, or even at the expense f a civil war, have placed her on the throne or England. The earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland, who possessed great power in the north, e leaders of this party; and the former nobleman made offer to the n of Scots, by Leonard Dacres, brother to Lord Dacres, that he would e her from confinement, and convey her to Scotland, or any other place o which she should think proper to retire.[*] Sir Thomas and Sir Edward Stanley, sons of the earl of Derby, Sir Thomas Gerrard, Rolstone, and r gentlemen whose interest lay in the neighborhood of the place where Mary resided, concurred in the same views; and required that, in order to e the execution of the scheme, a diversion should in the mean e be made from the side of Flanders.[**] Norfolk discouraged, and even, n appearance, suppressed these conspiracies; both because his duty to Elizabeth would not allow him to think of effecting his purpose by n, and because he foresaw that, if the queen of Scots came into e possession of these men, they would rather choose for her husband the g of Spain, or some foreign prince, who had power, as well as n, to reestablish the Catholic religion.[***]



When men of honor and good principles, like the duke of Norfolk, engage in s enterprises, they are commonly so unfortunate as to be criminal y halves; and while they balance between the execution of their designs d their remorses, their fear of punishment and their hope of pardon, y render themselves an easy prey to their enemies. The duke, in order o repress the surmises spread against him, spoke contemptuously to Elizabeth of the Scottish alliance; affirmed that his estate in England s more valuable than the revenue of a kingdom wasted by civil wars and s; and declared, that when he amused himself in his own s-court at Norwich amidst his friends and vassals, he deemed himself t least a petty prince, and was fully satisfied with his condition.[*]

Finding that he did not convince her by these asseverations, and that he s looked on with a jealous eye by the ministers, he retired to his y seat without taking leave.[**] He soon after repented of this e, and set out on his return to court, with a view of using every t to regain the queen’s good graces; but he was met at St. Albans y Fitz-Garret, lieutenant of the band of pensioners by whom he was d to Burnham, three miles from Windsor, where the court then d.[***]



He was soon after committed to the Tower, under the custody of Sir Henry Nevil. [*] Lesley, bishop of Ross, the queen of Scots’ ambassador, was d, and confronted with Norfolk before the council.[**] The earl of Pembroke was confined to his own house: Arundel, Lumley, and Throgmorton e taken into custody. The queen of Scots herself was removed to Coventry; all access to her was, during some time, more strictly d; and Viscount Hereford was joined to the earls of Shrewsbury d Huntingdon in the office of guarding her.



A rumor had been diffused in the north of an intended rebellion; and the l of Sussex, president of York, alarmed with the danger, sent for Northumberland and Westmoreland, in order to examine them: but not finding y proof against them, he allowed them to depart. The report, meanwhile, d ground daily; and many appearances of its reality being discovered, s were despatched by Elizabeth to these two noblemen, to appear at t, and answer for their conduct.[***] They had already proceeded so r in their criminal designs, that they dared not to trust themselves in r hands: they had prepared measures for a rebellion; had communicated r design to Mary and her ministers;[****] had entered into a e with the duke of Alva, governor of the Low Countries; had d his promise of a reÃ«nforcement of troops, and of a supply of arms d ammunition; and had prevailed on him to send over to London Chiapino Vitelii, one of his most famous captains, on pretence of adjusting some s with the queen, but in reality with a view of putting him at e head of the northern rebels.



The summons sent to the two earls precipitated the rising before they were y prepared; and Northumberland remained in suspense between opposite s, when he was informed that some of his enemies were on the way h a commission to arrest him. He took horse instantly, and hastened to s associate Westmoreland, whom he found surrounded with his friends and s, and deliberating with regard to the measures which he should w in the present emergence. They determined to begin the insurrection t delay; and the great credit of these two noblemen, with that zeal r the catholic religion which still prevailed in the neighborhood, soon w together multitudes of the common people. They published a manifesto, n which they declared that they intended to attempt nothing against the n, to whom they vowed unshaken allegiance: and that their sole aim was o reÃ«stablish the religion of their ancestors, to remove evil s, and to restore the duke of Norfolk and other faithful peers o their liberty and to the queen’s favor.[*] The number of the s amounted to four thousand foot and sixteen hundred horse; and y expected the concurrence of all the Catholics in England.[**]



The queen was not negligent in her own defence, and she had beforehand, m her prudent and wise conduct, acquired the general good will of her e, the best security of a sovereign; insomuch that even the Catholics n most counties expressed an affection for her service;[***] and the duke f Norfolk himself, though he had lost her favor, and lay in confinement, s not wanting, as far as his situation permitted, to promote the levies g his friends and retainers. Sussex, attended by the earls of Rutland, e lords Hunsdon, Evers, and Willoughby of Parham, marched against the s at the head of seven thousand men, and found them already advanced o the bishopric of Durham, of which they had taken possession. They d before him to Hexham; and hearing that the earl of Warwick and Lord Clinton were advancing against them with a greater body, they found o other resource than to disperse themselves without striking a blow. The n people retired to their houses: the leaders fled into Scotland.

Northumberland was found skulking in that country, and was confined by Murray in the Castle of Lochlevin. Westmoreland received shelter from the s of the Kers and Scots, partisans of Mary; and persuaded them to e an inroad into England, with a view of exciting a quarrel between the o kingdoms. After they had committed great ravages, they retreated to r own country. This sudden and precipitate rebellion was followed soon r by another still more imprudent, raised by Leonard Uacres. Lord Hunsdon, at the head of the garrison of Berwick, was able, without any r assistance, to quell these rebels. Great severity was exercised t such as had taken part in these rash enterprises. Sixty-six petty s were hanged;[****] and no less than eight hundred persons are d, on the whole, to have suffered by the hands of the executioner.[v]



But the queen was so well pleased with Norfolk’s behavior, that she d him from the Tower; allowed him to live, though under some show f confinement, in his own house; and only exacted a promise from him not o proceed any further in his negotiations with the queen of Scots.[*]



Elizabeth now found that the detention of Mary was attended with all the l consequences which she had foreseen when she first embraced that e. This latter princess recovering, by means of her misfortunes and r own natural good sense, from that delirium into which she seems to e been thrown during her attachment to Bothwell, had behaved with such y and judgment, and even dignity, that every one who approached her s charmed with her demeanor; and her friends were enabled, on some e grounds, to deny the reality of all those crimes which had been d to her.[**]



Compassion for her situation, and the necessity of procuring her liberty, d an incitement among all her partisans to be active in promoting her e; and as her deliverance from captivity, it was thought, could nowise e effected but by attempts dangerous to the established government, Elizabeth had reason to expect little tranquillity so long as the Scottish n remained a prisoner in her hands. But as this inconvenience had been d to the danger of allowing that princess to enjoy her liberty, d to seek relief in all the Catholic courts of Europe, it behoved the n to support the measure which she had adopted, and to guard, by every t expedient, against the mischiefs to which it was exposed. She l flattered Mary with hopes of her protection, maintained an ambiguous t between that queen and her enemies in Scotland, negotiated y concerning the terms of her restoration, made constant s of friendship to her; and by these artifices endeavored, both o prevent her from making any desperate efforts for her deliverance, and o satisfy the French and Spanish ambassadors, who never intermitted their s, sometimes accompanied with menaces, in her behalf. This t was received with the same deceit by the queen of Scots: s of confidence were returned by professions equally insincere: d while an appearance of friendship was maintained on both sides, the y and jealousy, which had long prevailed between them, became y day more inveterate and incurable. These two princesses, in address, y, activity, and spirit, were nearly a match for each other; but y, Mary, besides her present forlorn condition, was always r in personal conduct and discretion, as well as in power, to her s rival.



Elizabeth and Mary wrote at the same time letters to the regent. The queen f Scots desired, that her marriage with Bothwell might be examined, and a e be legally pronounced between them. The queen of England gave Murray the choice of three conditions; that Mary should be restored to her y on certain terms; that she should be associated with her son, and e administration remain in the regent’s hands, till the young prince d come to years of discretion; or that she should be allowed to live t liberty as a private person in Scotland, and have an honorable t made in her favor.[*] Murray summoned a convention of states, n order to deliberate on these proposals of the two queens. No answer was e by them to Mary’s letter, on pretence that she had there employed the e of a sovereign, addressing herself to her subjects; but in reality, e they saw that her request was calculated to prepare the way for a e with Norfolk, or some powerful prince, who could support her e, and restore her to the throne. They replied to Elizabeth that the o former conditions were so derogatory to the royal authority of their e, that they could not so much as deliberate concerning them: the d alone could be the subject of treaty. It was evident that Elizabeth, n proposing conditions so unequal in their importance, invited the Scots o a refusal of those which were most advantageous to Mary; and as it was t, if not impossible, to adjust all the terms of the third, so as o render it secure and eligible to all parties, it was concluded that she s not sincere in any of them.[**]



1570.



It is pretended, that Murray had entered into a private negotiation with e queen, to get Mary delivered into his hands;[*] and as Elizabeth found e detention of her in England so dangerous, it is probable that she d have been pleased, on any honorable or safe terms, to rid herself of a prisoner who gave her so much inquietude.[**] 15 But all these projects d by the sudden death of the regent, who was assassinated in e of a private injury, by a gentleman of the name of Hamilton.

Murray was a person of considerable vigor, abilities, and constancy; but h he was not unsuccessful, during his regency, in composing the s in Scotland, his talents shone out more eminently in the g than in the end of his life. His manners were rough and austere; d he possessed not that perfect integrity which frequently accompanies, d can alone atone for, that unamiable character.



By the death of the regent, Scotland relapsed into anarchy. Mary’s party d together, and made themselves masters of Edinburgh. The castle, d by Kirkaldy of Grange, seemed to favor her cause; and as many of e principal nobility had embraced that party, it became probable, though e people were in general averse to her, that her authority might again e the ascendant. To check its progress, Elizabeth despatched Sussex h an army to the north, under color of chastising the ravages committed y the borderers. He entered Scotland, and laid waste the lands of the Kers and Scots, seized the Castle of Hume, and committed hostilities on l Mary’s partisans, who, he said, had offended his mistress by harboring e English rebels. Sir William Drury was afterwards sent with a body of s, and he threw down the houses of the Hamiltons, who were engaged in e same faction. The English armies were afterwards recalled by agreement h the queen of Scots, who promised, in return, that no French troops d be introduced into Scotland, and that the English rebels should be d up to the queen by her partisans.[***]



But though the queen, covering herself with the pretence of revenging her n quarrel, so far contributed to support the party of the young king of Scots, she was cautious not to declare openly against Mary; and she even t a request, which was equivalent to a command, to the enemies of that s, not to elect, during some time, a regent in the place of Murray.[****] Lenox, the king’s grandfather, was therefore chosen y governor, under the title of lieutenant.



Hearing afterwards that Mary’s partisans, instead of delivering up Westmoreland and the other fugitives, as they had promised, had allowed m to escape into Flanders, she permitted the king’s party to give Lenox e title of regent,[*] and she sent Randolph, as her resident, to n a correspondence with him. But notwithstanding this step, taken n favor of Mary’s enemies, she never laid aside her ambiguous conduct, r quitted the appearance of amity to that princess. Being importuned by e bishop of Ross and her other agents, as well as by foreign s, she twice procured a suspension of arms between the Scottish s, and by that means stopped the hands of the regent, who was y to obtain advantages over the opposite party.[**] By these seeming s she kept alive the factions in Scotland, increased their l animosity, and rendered the whole country a scene of devastation d of misery.[***] She had no intention to conquer the kingdom, and y no interest or design to instigate the parties against each r; but this consequence was an accidental effect of her cautious s, by which she was engaged, as far as possible, to keep on good s with the queen of Scots, and never to violate the appearances of p with her, at least those of neutrality.[****] 16


The better to amuse Mary with the prospect of an accommodation, Cecil and Sir Walter Mildmay were sent to her with proposals from Elizabeth. The s were somewhat rigorous, such as a captive queen might expect from a s rival; and they thereby bore the greater appearance of sincerity n the part of the English court. It was required that the queen of Scots, s renouncing all title to the crown of England during the lifetime f Elizabeth, should make a perpetual league, offensive and defensive, n the kingdoms; that she should marry no Englishman without Elizabeth’s consent, nor any other person without the consent of the s of Scotland; that compensation should be made for the late ravages d in England; that justice should be executed on the murderers of King Henry; that the young prince should be sent into England, to be d there; and that six hostages, all of them noblemen, should be d to the queen of England, with the Castle of Hume, and some other s, for the security of performance.[*] Such were the conditions n which Elizabeth promised to contribute her endeavors towards the n of the deposed queen. The necessity of Mary’s affairs obliged r to consent to them; and the kings of France and Spain, as well as the e, when consulted by her, approved of her conduct chiefly on account of e civil wars, by which all Europe was at that time agitated, and which d the Catholic princes from giving her any assistance.[**]



Elizabeth’s commissioners proposed also to Mary a plan of accommodation h her subjects in Scotland; and after some reasoning on that head, it s agreed that the queen should require Lenox, the regent, to send s, in order to treat of conditions under her mediation. The s of Mary boasted, that all terms were fully settled with the t of England, and that the Scottish rebels would soon be constrained o submit to the authority of their sovereign; but Elizabeth took care t these rumors should meet with no credit, and that the king’s party d not be discouraged, nor sink too low in their demands. Cecil wrote o inform the regent, that all the queen of England’s proposals, so far m being fixed and irrevocable, were to be discussed anew in the e; and desired him to send commissioners who should be constant n the king’s cause, and cautious not to make concessions which might be l to their party.[***] Sussex, also, in his letters, dropped s to the same purpose; and Elizabeth herself said to the abbot of Dunfermling, whom Lenox had sent to the court of England, that she would t insist on Mary’s restoration, provided the Scots could make the e of their cause appear to her satisfaction; and that, even if their s should fall short of full conviction, she would take effectual e to provide for their future security.[****]



1571.



The parliament of Scotland appointed the earl of Morton and Sir James Macgill, together with the abbot of Dunfermling, to manage the treaty.

These commissioners presented memorials, containing reasons for the n of their queen; and they seconded their arguments with examples n from the Scottish history, with the authority of laws, and with the s of many famous divines. The lofty ideas which Elizabeth had d of the absolute, indefensible right of sovereigns, made her be d with these republican topics; and she told the Scottish s, that she was no wise satisfied with their reasons for g the conduct of their countrymen; and that they might therefore, t attempting any apology, proceed to open the conditions which they d for their security.[*] They replied that their commission did not r them to treat of any terms which might infringe the title and y of their young king; but they would gladly hear whatever s should be made them by her majesty. The conditions recommended y the queen were not disadvantageous to Mary; but as the commissioners l insisted that they were not authorized to treat in any manner g the restoration of that princess,[**] the conferences were y at an end; and Elizabeth dismissed the Scottish commissioners, h injunctions that they should return, after having procured more ample s from their parliament.[***] The bishop of Ross openly complained to e English council that they had abused his mistress by fair promises and s; and Mary herself was no longer at a loss to judge of Elizabeth’s insincerity. By reason of these disappointments, matters came l nearer to extremities between the two princesses; and the queen of Scots, finding all her hopes eluded, was more strongly incited to make, at l hazards, every possible attempt for her liberty and security.



An incident also happened about this time, which tended to widen the h between Mary and Elizabeth, and to increase the vigilance and y of the latter princess. Pope Pius V., who had succeeded Paul, r having endeavored in vain to conciliate by gentle means the p of Elizabeth, whom his predecessor’s violence had irritated, d at last a bull of excommunication against her, deprived her of all e to the crown, and absolved her subjects from their oaths of e.[****]



It seems probable that this attack on the queen’s authority was made in t with Mary, who intended by that means to forward the northern n; a measure which was at that time in agitation.[*] John Felton d this bull to the gates of the bishop of London’s palace; and g either to fly or to deny the fact, he was seized and condemned d received the crown of martyrdom, for which he seems to have d so violent an ambition.[**]



A new parliament, after five years’ interval, was assembled at Westminster; and as the queen, by the rage of the pope against her, was e still more the head of the ruling party, it might be expected, both m this incident and from her own prudent and vigorous conduct, that her y over the two houses would be absolutely uncontrollable. It was o in fact; yet is it remarkable, that it prevailed not without some small n; and that too arising chiefly from the height of zeal for Protestantism; a disposition of the English which, in general, contributed y to increase the queen’s popularity. We shall be somewhat r in relating the transactions of this session, because they w, as well the extent of the royal power during that age, as the r of Elizabeth, and the genius of her government. It will be s also to observe the faint dawn of the spirit of liberty among the English, the jealousy with which that spirit was repressed by the n, the imperious conduct which was maintained in opposition to it, d the ease with which it was subdued by this arbitrary princess.



The lord keeper Bacon, after the speaker of the commons was elected, told e parliament, in the queen’s name, that she enjoined them not to meddle h any matters of state:[***] such was his expression; by which he y meant, the questions of the queen’s marriage, and the succession, t which they had before given her some uneasiness; for as to the other t points of government, alliances, peace and war, or foreign s, no parliament in that age ever presumed to take them under n, or question, in these particulars, the conduct of their n, or of his ministers.



In the former parliament, the Puritans had introduced seven bills for a r reformation in religion; but they had not been able to prevail in y one of them.[****] This house of commons had sitten a very few days, n Stricland, a member, revived one of the bills—that for the t of the liturgy.[v]



The chief objection which he mentioned, was the sign of the cross in m. Another member added the kneeling at the sacrament; and remarked, t if a posture of humiliation were requisite in that act of devotion, t were better that the communicants should throw themselves prostrate on e ground, in order to keep at the widest distance from former n.[*]



Religion was a point of which Elizabeth was, if possible, still more s than of matters of state. She pretended, that in quality of e head or governor of the church, she was fully empowered, by her e alone, to decide all questions which might arise with regard o doctrine, discipline, or worship; and she never would allow her s so much as to take these points into consideration.[**] The s did not forget to insist on this topic: the treasurer of the d, though he allowed that any heresy might be repressed by t, (a concession which seems to have been rash and unguarded, e the act investing the crown with the supremacy, or rather g that prerogative, gave the sovereign full power to reform all s,) yet he affirmed, that it belonged to the queen alone, as head f the church, to regulate every question of ceremony in worship.[***] The r seconded this argument; insisted on the extent of the queen’s e; and said that the house might, from former examples, have n warning not to meddle with such matters. One Pistor opposed these s of the courtiers. He was scandalized, he said, that affairs f such infinite consequence (namely, kneeling, and making the sign of the s) should be passed over so lightly. These questions, he added, n the salvation of souls, and interest every one more deeply than e monarchy of the whole world. This cause he showed to be the cause of God; the rest were all but terrene, yea, trifles in comparison, call them r so great: subsidies, crowns, kingdoms, he knew not what weight they d, when laid in the balance with subjects of such unspeakable e.[****] Though the zeal of this member seems to have been d of, the house, overawed by the prerogative, voted upon the n, that a petition should be presented to her majesty for her e to proceed further in this bill; and in the mean time that they d stop all debate or reasoning concerning it.[v]



Matters would probably have rested here, had not the queen been so highly d with Stricland’s presumption in moving the bill for reformation f the liturgy, that she summoned him before the council, and prohibited m thenceforth from appearing in the house of commons.[*] This act of r was too violent even for the submissive parliament to endure.

Carleton took notice of the matter; complained that the liberties of the e were invaded; observed that Stricland was not a private man, but d a multitude: and moved that he might be sent for, and if he e guilty of any offence, might answer for it at the bar of the house, h he insinuated to be the only competent tribunal.[**] Yelverton d the principles of liberty with still greater boldness. He said, t the precedent was dangerous; and though, in this happy time of y, among so many good and honorable personages as were at present d with authority, nothing of extremity or injury was to be d, yet the times might alter; what now is permitted, might r be construed as duty, and might be enforced even on the ground f the present permission. He added, that all matters not treasonable, or h implied not “too much” derogation of the imperial crown, might, t offence, be introduced into parliament; where every question that d the community must be considered, and where even the right of e crown itself must finally be determined. He remarked, that men sat not n that house in their private capacities, but as elected by their y; and though it was proper that the prince should retain his e, yet was that prerogative limited by law: as the sovereign d not of himself make laws, neither could he break them merely from s own authority.[***]



These principles were popular, and noble, and generous; but the open n of them was, at this time, somewhat new in England; and the s were more warranted by present practice, when they advanced a y doctrine. The treasurer warned the house to be cautious in their s; neither to venture further than their assured warrant might d, nor hazard their good opinion with her majesty in any doubtful e. The member, he said, whose attendance they required, was not d on account of any liberty of speech, but for his exhibiting a l in the house against the prerogative of the queen; a temerity which s not to be tolerated. And he concluded with observing, that even s made in that house had been questioned and examined by the n.[*] Cleere, another member, remarked, that the sovereign’s e is not so much as disputable, and that the safety of the queen s the safety of the subject. He added, that in questions of divinity, y man was for his instruction to repair to his ordinary; and he seems o insinuate, that the bishops themselves, for their instruction, must r to the queen.[**] Fleetwood observed, that in his memory, he knew a n who, in the fifth of the present queen, had been called to account for a speech in the house. But lest this example should be deemed too recent, e would inform them, from the parliament rolls, that, in the reign of Henry V., a bishop was committed to prison by the king’s command, on t of his freedom of speech; and the parliament presumed not to go r than to be humble suitors for him: in the subsequent reign, the r himself was committed, with another member; and the house found no r remedy than a like submissive application. He advised the house to e recourse to the same expedient, and not to presume either to send for r member, or demand him as of right.[***] During this speech, those s of the privy council who sat in the house whispered together; upon h the speaker moved that the house should make stay of all further s: a motion which was immediately complied with. The queen, g that the experiment which she had made was likely to excite a t ferment, saved her honor by this silence of the house; and lest the n might be resumed, she sent next day to Stricland her permission o give his attendance in parliament.[****]



Notwithstanding this rebuke from the throne, the zeal of the commons still d them to continue the discussion of those other bills which d religion; but they were interrupted by a still more arbitrary g of the queen, in which the lords condescended to be her s. This house sent a message to the commons, desiring that a e might attend them. Some members were appointed for that purpose; d the upper house informed them, that the queen’s majesty, being d of the articles of reformation which they had canvassed, approved f them, intended to publish them, and to make the bishops execute them by e of her royal authority, as supreme head of the church of England; t that she would not permit them to be treated of in parliament.[*] The e, though they did not entirely stop proceedings on account of this n, seem to have been nowise offended at such haughty treatment; d in the issue, all the bills came to nothing.



A motion made by Robert Bell, a Puritan, against an exclusive patent d to a company of merchants in Bristol,[**] gave also occasion to l remarkable incidents. The queen, some days after the motion was e, sent orders, by the mouth of the speaker, commanding the house to d little time in motions, and to avoid long speeches. All the members d that she had been offended, because a matter had been moved h seemed to touch her prerogative.[***] Fleetwood accordingly spoke of s delicate subject. He observed, that the queen had a prerogative of g patents; that to question the validity of any patent was to e the royal prerogative; that all foreign trade was entirely d to the pleasure of the sovereign; that even the statute which e liberty of commerce, admitted of all prohibitions from the crown; and t the prince, when he granted an exclusive patent, only employed the r vested in him, and prohibited all others from dealing in any r branch of commerce. He quoted the clerk of the parliament’s k to prove, that no man might speak in parliament of the statute of s, unless the king first gave license; because the royal prerogative n the wards was thereby touched. He showed, likewise, the statutes of Edward I., Edward III., and Henry IV., with a saving of the prerogative.

And in Edward VI.‘s time, the protector was applied to for his allowance o mention matters of prerogative.[****]



Sir Humphrey Gilbert, the gallant and renowned sea adventurer, carried e topics still further. He endeavored to prove the motion made by Bell o be a vain device, and perilous to be treated of; since it tended to the n of the prerogative imperial, which whoever should attempt so h as in fancy, could not, he said, be otherwise accounted than an open y. For what difference is there between saying, that the queen is not o use the privilege of the crown and saying, that she is not queen? And h experience has shown so much clemency in her majesty, as might, s, make subjects forget their duty, it is not good to sport or e too much with princes. He reminded them of the fable of the hare, o, upon the proclamation that all horned beasts should depart the court, y fled, lest his ears should be construed to be horns; and by s apologue he seems to insinuate, that even those who heard or d such dangerous speeches, would not themselves be entirely free m danger. He desired them to beware, lest if they meddled further with e matters, the queen might look to her own power; and finding herself e to suppress their challenged liberty, and to exert an arbitrary y, might imitate the example of Lewis XI. of France, who, as he d it, delivered the crown from wardship.[*]



Though this speech gave some disgust, nobody, at the time, replied any g, but that Sir Humphrey mistook the meaning of the house, and of the r who made the motion: they never had any other purpose, than to t their grievances, in due and seemly form, unto her majesty. But n a subsequent debate, Peter Wentworth, a man of a superior free spirit, d that speech an insult on the house; noted Sir Humphrey’s n to flatter and fawn on the prince; compared him to the n, which can change itself into all colors, except white; and d to the house a due care of liberty of speech, and of the s of parliament.[**]



It appears, on the whole, that the motion against the exclusive patent had o effect. Bell, the member who first introduced it, was sent for by the l, and was severely reprimanded for his temerity. He returned to the e with such an amazed countenance, that all the members, well informed f the reason, were struck with terror; and during some time no one durst e to speak of any matter of importance, for fear of giving offence to e queen and council. Even after the fears of the commons were somewhat d, the members spoke with extreme precaution; and by employing most f their discourse in preambles and apologies, they showed their conscious r of the rod which hung over them. Wherever any delicate point was d, though ever so gently; nay, seemed to be approached, though at r so great a distance; the whisper ran about the house, “The queen will e offended; the council will be extremely displeased:” and by these s men were warned of the danger to which they exposed themselves.

It is remarkable that the patent, which the queen defended with such s violence, was contrived for the profit of four courtiers, and s attended with the utter ruin of seven or eight thousand of her s subjects.[*]



Thus every thing which passed the two houses was extremely respectful and e; yet did the queen think it incumbent on her, at the conclusion f the session, to check and that with great severity, those feeble s of liberty which had appeared in the motions and speeches of some s. The lord keeper told the commons, in her majesty’s name, that h the majority of the lower house had shown themselves in their s discreet and dutiful, yet a few of them had discovered a y character, and had justly merited the reproach of audacious, t, and presumptuous: contrary to their duty, both as subjects and t men; nay, contrary to the express injunctions given them from e throne at the beginning of the session; injunctions which it might l become them to have better attended to; they had presumed to call in n her majesty’s grants and prerogatives. But her majesty warns m, that since they thus wilfully forget themselves, they are otherwise o be admonished: some other species of correction must be found for them; e neither the commands of her majesty, nor the example of their wiser n, can reclaim their audacious, arrogant, and presumptuous folly, y which they are thus led to meddle with what nowise belongs to them, and t lies beyond the compass of their understanding.[**]



In all these transactions appears clearly the opinion which Elizabeth had d of the duty and authority of parliaments. They were not to s any matters of state; still less were they to meddle with the h. Questions of either kind were far above their reach, and were d to the prince alone, or to those councils and ministers with m he was pleased to intrust them. What then was the office of s? They might give directions for the due tanning of leather, or g of cloth; for the preservation of pheasants and partridges; for e reparation of bridges and highways; for the punishment of vagabonds or n beggars. Regulations concerning the police of the country came y under their inspection; and the laws of this kind which they d, had, if not a greater, yet a more durable authority, than e which were derived solely from the proclamations of the sovereign.

Precedents or reports could fix a rule for decisions in private property, r the punishment of crimes; but no alteration or innovation in the l law could proceed from any other source than the parliament; nor d the courts of justice be induced to change their established e by an order of council. But the most acceptable part of y proceedings was the granting of subsidies; the attainting d punishing of the obnoxious nobility, or any minister of state after s fall; the countenancing of such great efforts of power, as might be d somewhat exceptionable, when they proceeded entirely from the n. The redress of grievances were sometimes promised to the e; but seldom could have place, while it was an established rule, t the prerogatives of the crown must not be abridged, or so much as d and examined in parliament. Even though monopolies and e companies had already reached an enormous height, and were every y increasing to the destruction of all liberty, and extinction of all y, it was criminal in a member to propose, in the most dutiful and r manner, a parliamentary application against any of them.



These maxims of government were not kept secret by Elizabeth, nor smoothed r by any fair appearances or plausible pretences. They were openly d in her speeches and messages to parliament; and were accompanied h all the haughtiness, nay, sometimes bitterness of expression, which e meanest servant could look for from his offended master. Yet, g this conduct, Elizabeth continued to be the most popular n that ever swayed the sceptre of England; because the maxims of r reign were conformable to the principles of the times, and to the n generally entertained with regard to the constitution. The d encroachments of popular assemblies on Elizabeth’s successors e so changed our ideas in these matters, that the passages above d appear to us extremely curious, and even, at first, surprising; t they were so little remarked, during the time, that neither Camden, h a contemporary writer, nor any other historian, has taken any e of them. So absolute, indeed, was the authority of the crown, that e precious spark of liberty had been kindled, and was preserved, by the Puritans alone; and it was to this sect, whose principles appear so s, and habits so ridiculous, that the English owe the whole m of their constitution. Actuated by that zeal which belongs to s, and by the courage which enthusiasm inspires, they hazarded e utmost indignation of their sovereign, and employing all their y to be elected into parliament,—a matter not difficult while a seat was rather regarded as a burden than an advantage—they first d a majority in that assembly, and then obtained an ascendent over e church and monarchy.



The following were the principal laws enacted this session. It was d treason, during the lifetime of the queen, to affirm that she was t the lawful sovereign, or that any other possessed a preferable title, r that she was a heretic, schismatic, or infidel, or that the laws and s cannot limit and determine the right of the crown and the r thereof: to maintain, in writing or printing, that any person, t the “natural issue” of her body, is, or ought to be, the queen’s r or successor, subjected the person and all his abettors, for the t offence, to imprisonment during a year, and to the forfeiture of f their goods: the second offence subjected them to the penalty of a rÃ¦munire.[*] This law was plainly levelled against the queen of Scots and r partisans; and implied an avowal, that Elizabeth never intended to e her successor. It may be noted, that the usual phrase of “lawful e,” which the parliament thought indecent towards the queen, as if she d be supposed to have any other, was changed into that of “natural e.” But this alteration was the source of pleasantry during the time; d some suspected a deeper design, as if Leicester intended, in case of e queen’s demise, to produce some bastard of his own, and affirm that he s her offspring.[**]



It was also enacted, that whosoever by bulls should publish absolutions or r rescripts of the pope, or should, by means of them, reconcile any n to the church of Rome, such offenders, as well as those who were so d, should be guilty of treason. The penalty of a prÃ¦munire was d on every one who imported any Agnus Dei, crucifix, or such other t of superstition, consecrated by the pope.[*] The former laws t usury were enforced by a new statute.[**] A supply of one subsidy d two fifteenths was granted by parliament. The queen, as she was d to yield to them none of her power, was very cautious in asking m for any supply. She endeavored, either by a rigid frugality to make r ordinary revenues suffice for the necessities of the crown, or she d her prerogative, and procured money by the granting of patents, s, or by some such ruinous expedient.



Though Elizabeth possessed such uncontrolled authority over her s, and such extensive influence over her people; though, during a course of thirteen years, she had maintained the public tranquillity, h was only interrupted by the hasty and ill-concerted insurrection in e north; she was still kept in great anxiety, and felt her throne y totter under her. The violent commotions excited in France and e Low Countries, as well as in Scotland, seemed in one view to secure r against any disturbance; but they served, on more reflection, to t her in the danger of her situation, when she remarked that England, no less than these neighboring countries, contained the seeds of e discord; the differences of religious opinion, and the furious e and animosity of the opposite sectaries.



The league, formed at Bayonne in 1566, for the extermination of the Protestants, had not been concluded so secretly but intelligence of it had d CondÃ©, Coligny, and the other leaders of the Hugonots; and finding t the measures of the court agreed with their suspicions, they d to prevent the cruel perfidy of their enemies, and to strike a w before the Catholics were aware of the danger. The Hugonots, though d over the whole kingdom, formed a kind of separate empire; and g closely united, as well by their religious zeal as by the dangers to h they were perpetually exposed, they obeyed with entire submission e orders of their leaders, and were ready on every signal to fly to s. The king and queen mother were living in great security at Monceaux, n Brie, when they found themselves surrounded by Protestant troops, which d secretly marched thither from all quarters; and had not a body of Swiss come speedily to their relief, and conducted them with great y to Paris, they must have fallen, without resistance, into the s of the malecontents. A battle was afterwards fought in the plains of St. Denis; where, though the old constable, Montmorency, the general of e Catholics, was killed combating bravely at the head of his troops, the Hugonots were finally defeated. CondÃ©, collecting his broken forces and g a strong reÃ«nforcement from the German Protestants, appeared n in the field; and laying siege to Chartres, a place of great e, obliged the court to agree to a new accommodation.



So great was the mutual animosity of those religionists, that even had the s on both sides been ever so sincere in their intentions for peace, d reposed ever so much confidence in each other, it would have been t to retain the people in tranquillity; much more where such e jealousy prevailed, and where the court employed every n as a snare for their enemies. A plan was laid for seizing the n of the prince and admiral; who narrowly escaped to Rochelle, and d their partisans to their assistance.[*]



The civil wars were renewed with greater fury than ever, and the parties e still more exasperated against each other. The young duke of Anjou, r to the king, commanded the forces of the Catholics; and fought in

1569, a great battle at Jarnac with the Hugonots, where the prince of CondÃ© was killed, and his army defeated. This discomfiture, with the loss f so great a leader, reduced not the Hugonots to despair. The admiral l supported the cause; and having placed at the head of the Protestants the prince of Navarre, then sixteen years of age, and the g prince of CondÃ©, he encouraged the party rather to perish bravely in e field, than ignominiously by the hands of the executioner. He d such numbers, so determined to endure every extremity, that he s enabled to make head against the duke of Anjou; and being strengthened y a new reÃ«nforcement of Germans, he obliged that prince to retreat and o divide his forces.



Coligny then laid siege to Poietiers; and as the eyes of all France were d on this enterprise, the duke of Guise, emulous of the renown which s father had acquired by the defence of Metz, threw himself into the e, and so animated the garrison by his valor and conduct, that the l was obliged to raise the siege. Such was the commencement of that d fame and grandeur afterwards attained by this duke of Guise.

The attachment which all the Catholics had borne to his father, was y transferred to the son; and men pleased themselves in g all the great and shining qualities which seemed, in a manner, y in that family. Equal in affability, in munificence, in s, in eloquence, and in every quality which engages the affections f men; equal also in valor, in conduct, in enterprise, in capacity; there d only this difference between them, that the son, educated in more t times, and finding a greater dissolution of all law and order, d the father in ambition and temerity, and was engaged in s still more destructive to the authority of his sovereign, and o the repose of his native country.



Elizabeth, who kept her attention fixed on the civil commotions of France, s nowise pleased with this new rise of her enemies, the Guises; and g anxious for the fate of the Protestants, whose interests were d with her own,[*] she was engaged, notwithstanding her aversion m all rebellion, and from all opposition to the will of the sovereign, o give them secretly some assistance. Besides employing her authority h the German princes, she lent money to the queen of Navarre, and d some jewels as pledges for the loan. And she permitted Henry Champernon to levy, and transport over into France, a regiment of a d gentlemen volunteers; among whom Walter Raleigh, then a young man, n to distinguish himself, in that great school of military valor.[**]



The admiral, constrained by the impatience of his troops, and by the y of subsisting them, fought with the duke of Anjou the battle of Moncontour in Poictou, where he was wounded and defeated. The court of France, notwithstanding their frequent experience of the obstinacy of the Hugonots, and the vigor of Coligny, vainly flattered themselves that the e of the rebels was at last finally annihilated; and they neglected r preparations against a foe, who, they thought, could never more e dangerous. They were surprised to hear, that this leader had d, without dismay, in another quarter of the kingdom; had d the young princes, whom he governed to like constancy; had d an army; had taken the field; and was even strong enough to n Paris. The public finances, diminished by the continued disorders f the kingdom, and wasted by so many fruitless military enterprises, d no longer bear the charge of a new armament, and the king, g his extreme animosity against the Hugonots, was obliged, n 1570, to conclude an accommodation with them, to grant them a pardon r all past offences, and to renew the edicts for liberty of conscience.



Though a pacification was seemingly concluded, the mind of Charles was e reconciled to his rebellious subjects, and this accommodation, like l the foregoing, was nothing but a snare, by which the perfidious court d projected to destroy at once, without danger, all its formidable s. As the two young princes, the admiral, and the other leaders of e Hugonots, instructed by past experience, discovered an extreme t of the king’s intentions, and kept themselves in security at a e, all possible artifices were employed to remove their s, and to convince them of the sincerity of the new counsels h seemed to be embraced. The terms of the peace were religiously d to them; the toleration was strictly maintained; all attempts e by the zealous Catholics to infringe it were punished with severity; s, and favors, and honors were bestowed on the principal nobility g the Protestants; and the king and council every where declared that, d of civil disorders, and convinced of the impossibility of forcing n’s consciences, they were thenceforth determined to allow every one the e exercise of his religion.



Among the other artifices employed to lull the Protestants into a fatal y, Charles affected to enter into close connections with Elizabeth; d as it seemed not the interest of France to forward the union of the o kingdoms of Great Britain, that princess the more easily flattered f that the French monarch would prefer her friendship to that of the n of Scots. The better to deceive her, proposals of marriage were made r with the duke of Anjou; a prince whose youth, beauty, and reputation r valor might naturally be supposed to recommend him to a woman who had d not altogether insensible to these endowments. The queen y founded on this offer the project of deceiving the court of France; and being intent on that artifice, she laid herself the more open o be deceived. Negotiations were entered into with regard to the e; terms of the contract were proposed; difficulties started and d; and the two courts, equally insincere, though not equally e, seemed to approach every day nearer to each other in their s and concessions. The great obstacle seemed to lie in adjusting the e of religion; because Elizabeth, who recommended toleration to Charles, was determined not to grant it in her own dominions, not even to r husband; and the duke of Anjou seemed unwilling to submit, for the e of interest, to the dishonor of an apostasy.[*]



The artificial politics of Elizabeth never triumphed so much in any s as in those which were conjoined with her coquetry; and as r character in this particular was generally known, the court of France t that they might, without danger of forming any final conclusion, e the further in their concessions and offers to her. The queen also d other motives for dissimulation. Besides the advantage of discouraging Mary’s partisans by the prospect of an alliance between France and England, her situation with Philip demanded her utmost vigilance and n; and the violent authority established in the Low Countries made r desirous of fortifying herself even with the bare appearance of a new y.



The theological controversies which had long agitated Europe, had from the g penetrated into the Low Countries; and as these provinces d an extensive commerce, they had early received, from every m with which they corresponded, a tincture of religious innovation.

An opinion at that time prevailed, which had been zealously propagated by s, and implicitly received by sovereigns, that heresy was closely d with rebellion, and that every great or violent alteration in e church involved a like revolution in the civil government. The forward l of the reformers would seldom allow them to wait the consent of the e to their innovations: they became less dutiful when opposed and d; and though their pretended spirit of reasoning and inquiry was n reality nothing but a new species of implicit faith, the prince took e alarm, as if so institutions could be secure from the temerity of r researches. The emperor Charles, who proposed to augment his y under pretence of defending the Catholic faith, easily adopted e political principles; and notwithstanding the limited prerogative h he possessed in the Netherlands, he published the most arbitrary, e, and tyrannical edicts against the Protestants; and he took care t the execution of them should be no less violent and sanguinary. He s neither cruel nor bigoted in his natural disposition; yet an n, celebrated for moderation and caution, has computed, that in e several persecutions promoted by that monarch, no less than a hundred d persons perished by the hands of the executioner.[*] But these e remedies; far from answering the purposes intended, had rather d to augment the numbers as well as zeal of the reformers; and the s of the several towns, seeing no end of those barbarous s, felt their humanity rebel against their principles, and d any further persecution of the new doctrines.



When Philip succeeded to his father’s dominions, the Flemings were justly d with new apprehensions, lest their prince, observing the lenity of e magistrates, should take the execution of the edicts from such remiss s, and should establish the inquisition in the Low Countries, d with all the iniquities and barbarities which attended it in Spain. The severe and unrelenting character of the man, his professed t to Spanish manners, the inflexible bigotry of his principles; l these circumstances increased their terror; and when he departed the Netherlands, with a known intention never to return, the disgust of the s was extremely augmented, and their dread of those tyrannical s which their sovereign, surrounded with Spanish ministers, would e from his cabinet at Madrid. He left the duchess of Parma governess f the Low Countries, and the plain good sense and good temper of that s, had she been intrusted with the sole power, would have preserved e submission of those opulent provinces, which were lost from that t of treacherous and barbarous politics on which Philip so highly d himself. The Flemings found, that the name alone of regent remained h the duchess; that Cardinal Granville entirely possessed the king’s e; that attempts were every day made on their liberties; that a n was taken never more to assemble the states; that new s were arbitrarily erected, in order to enforce the execution of e persecuting edicts; and that, on the whole, they must expect to be d to the condition of a province under the Spanish monarchy. The s of the nobility gave countenance to the complaints of the y, which encouraged the mutiny of the populace; and all orders of men d a strong disposition to revolt. Associations were formed, y petitions presented, names of distinction assumed, badges of y displayed; and the current of the people, impelled by religious l, and irritated by feeble resistance, rose to such a height, that in l towns, particularly in Antwerp, they made an open invasion on the d worship, pillaged the churches and monasteries, broke the s, and committed the most unwarrantable disorders.



The wiser part of the nobility, particularly the prince of Orange, and the s Egmont and Horn, were alarmed at these excesses, to which their own s had at first given countenance; and seconding the wisdom of e governess, they suppressed the dangerous insurrections, punished the s, and reduced all the provinces to a state of order and n. But Philip was not contented with the reÃ«stablishment of his t authority: he considered that provinces so remote from the seat of t could not be ruled by a limited prerogative; and that a prince o must entreat rather than command, would necessarily, when he resided t among the people, feel every day a diminution of his power and e. He determined, therefore, to lay hold of the late popular s as a pretence for entirely abolishing the privileges of the Low Country provinces, and for ruling them thenceforth with a military and y authority.



In the execution of this violent design, he employed a man who was a r instrument in the hands of such a tyrant. Ferdinand of Toledo, duke f Alva, had been educated amidst arms; and having attained a consummate e in the military art, his habits led him to transfer into all t the severe discipline of a camp, and to conceive no measures n prince and subject but those of rigid command and implicit e. This general, in 1568, conducted from Italy to the Low Countries a powerful body of veteran Spaniards; and his avowed animosity o the Flemings, with his known character, struck that whole people with r and consternation. It belongs not to our subject to relate at h those violences which Alva’s natural barbarity, steeled by n and aggravated by insolence, exercised on those flourishing s. It suffices to say, that all their privileges, the gift of so y princes, and the inheritance of so many ages, were openly and y abolished by edict; arbitrary and sanguinary tribunals erected; e counts Egmont and Horn, in spite of their great merits and past s, brought to the scaffold; multitudes of all ranks thrown into t, and thence delivered over to the executioner; and g the peaceable submission of all men, nothing was heard of t confiscation, imprisonment, exile, torture, and death.



Elizabeth was equally displeased to see the progress of that scheme laid r the extermination of the Protestants, and to observe the erection of o great a military power in a state situated in so near a neighborhood.

She gave protection to all the Flemish exiles who took shelter in her s; and as many of these were the most industrious inhabitants of e Netherlands, and had rendered that country celebrated for its arts, e reaped the advantage of introducing into England some useful s, which were formerly unknown in that kingdom. Foreseeing that e violent government of Alva could not long subsist without exciting e commotion, she ventured to commit an insult upon him, which she would e been cautious not to hazard against a more established authority.

Some Genoese merchants had engaged, by contract with Philip, to transport o Flanders the sum of four hundred thousand crowns; and the vessels on h this money was embarked, had been attacked in the Channel by some s equipped by the French Hugonots, and had taken shelter in Plymouth and Southampton. The commanders of the ships pretended that the y belonged to the king of Spain; but the queen, finding upon inquiry t it was the property of Genoese merchants, took possession of it as a n; and by that means deprived the duke of Alva of this resource in the e of his greatest necessity. Alva, in revenge, seized all the English s in the Low Countries, threw them into prison, and confiscated r effects. The queen retaliated by a like violence on the Flemish and Spanish merchants; and gave all the English liberty to make reprisals on e subjects of Philip.



These differences were afterwards accommodated by treaty, and mutual s were made to the merchants; but nothing could repair the loss h so well-timed a blow inflicted on the Spanish government in the Low Countries. Alva, in want of money, and dreading the immediate mutiny of s troops, to whom great arrears were due, imposed, by his arbitrary l, the most ruinous taxes on the people. He not only required the h penny, and the twentieth of all immovable goods; he also d the tenth of all movable goods on every sale; an absurd tyranny, h would not only have destroyed all arts and commerce, but even have d the common intercourse of life. The people refused compliance; e duke had recourse to his usual expedient of the gibbet; and thus s came still nearer the last, extremities between the Flemings and e Spaniards.[*]



All the enemies of Elizabeth, in order to revenge themselves for her s, had naturally recourse to one policy, the supporting of the cause d pretensions of the queen of Scots; and Alva, whose measures were ever t, soon opened a secret intercourse with that princess. There was e Rodolphi, a Florentine merchant, who had resided about fifteen years n London, and who, while he conducted his commerce in England, had d all the correspondence of the court of Rome with the Catholic y and gentry.[**]



He had been thrown into prison at the time when the duke of Norfolk’s s with Mary had been discovered; but either no proof, was found t him, or the part which he had acted was not very criminal; and he n after recovered his liberty. This man, zealous for the Catholic h, had formed a scheme, in concert with the Spanish ambassador, for g the government, by a foreign invasion and a domestic n; and when he communicated his project by letter to Mary, he d, that as she was now fully convinced of Elizabeth’s artifices, and d of ever recovering her authority, or even her liberty, by c measures, she willingly gave her concurrence. The great number of d Catholics were the chief source of their hopes on the side of England and they also observed that the kingdom was at that time full of t gentry, chiefly younger brothers, who, having at present, by the e decay of the church, and the yet languishing state of commerce, no t of a livelihood suitable to their birth, were ready to throw s into any desperate enterprise.[*] But in order to inspire life d courage into all these malecontents, it was requisite that some great n should put himself at their head; and no one appeared to Rodolphi, and to the bishop of Ross, who entered into all these intrigues, o proper, both on account of his power and his popularity, as the duke of Norfolk.



This nobleman, when released from confinement in the Tower, had given his e, that he would drop all intercourse with the queen of Scots;[**] t finding that he had lost, and, as he feared, beyond recovery, the e and favor of Elizabeth, and being still in some degree d from his liberty, he was tempted, by impatience and despair, to e his word, and to open anew his correspondence with the captive s.[***] A promise of marriage was renewed between them; the duke d to enter into all her interests; and as his remorses gradually d in the course of these transactions, he was pushed to give his t to enterprises still more criminal. Rodolphi’s plan was, that the e of Alva should, on some other pretence, assemble a great quantity of g in the Low Countries; should transport a body of six thousand t and four thousand horse into England; should land them at Harwich, e the duke of Norfolk was to join them with all his friends; should e march directly to London, and oblige the queen to submit to r terms the conspirators should please to impose upon her.[****]

Norfolk expressed his assent to this plan; and three letters, in e of it, were written in his name by Rodolphi; one to Alva, r to the pope, and a third to the king of Spain; but the duke, e of the danger, refused to sign them.[v]



He only sent to the Spanish ambassador a servant and confidant, named Barker, as well to notify his concurrence in the plan, as to vouch for the y of these letters; and Rodolphi, having obtained a letter of e from the ambassador, proceeded on his journey to Brussels and to Rome. The duke of Alva and the pope embraced the scheme with alacrity: Rodolphi informed Norfolk of their intentions;[*] and every thing seemed o concur in forwarding the undertaking.



Norfolk, notwithstanding these criminal enterprises, had never entirely n his duty to his sovereign, his country, and his religion: and h he had laid the plan both of an invasion and an insurrection, he l flattered himself, that the innocence of his intentions would y the violence of his measures, and that, as he aimed at nothing but e liberty of the queen of Scots, and the obtaining of Elizabeth’s t to his marriage, he could not justly reproach himself as a rebel d a traitor.[**] It is certain, however, that, considering the queen’s r and spirit, the scheme, if successful, must finally have ended in g her; and her authority was here exposed to the utmost danger.



The conspiracy hitherto had entirely escaped the vigilance of Elizabeth, d that of Secretary Cecil, who now bore the title of Lord Burleigh. It s from another attempt of Norfolk’s that they first obtained a hint, h, being diligently traced, led at last to a full discovery. Mary had d to send a sum of money to Lord Herreis and her partisans in Scotland; and Norfolk undertook to have it delivered to Bannister, a t of his, at that time in the north, who was to find some expedient r conveying it to Lord Herreis.[***] He intrusted the money to a servant o was not in the secret, and told him, that the bag contained a sum of y in silver, which he was to deliver to Bannister with a letter: but e servant, conjecturing from the weight and size of the bag that it was l of gold, carried the letter to Burleigh; who immediately ordered Bannister, Barker, and Hicford, the duke’s secretary, to be put under t, and to undergo a severe examination. Torture made them confess the e truth; and as Hicford, though ordered to burn all papers, had y kept them concealed under the mats of the duke’s chamber, and r the tiles of the house, full evidence now appeared against his r.[****]



Norfolk himself, who was entirely ignorant of the discoveries made by his s, was brought before the council; and though exhorted to atone for s guilt by a full confession, he persisted in denying every crime with h he was charged. The queen always declared, that if he had given her s proof of his sincere repentance, she would have pardoned all his r offences;[*] but finding him obstinate, she committed him to the Tower, and ordered him to be brought to his trial. The bishop of Ross had, n some suspicion, been committed to custody before the discovery of Norfolk’s guilt; and every expedient was employed to make him reveal his e in the conspiracy. He at first insisted on his privilege: but he was d, that as his mistress was no longer a sovereign, he would not be d as an ambassador, and that, even if that character were allowed, t did not warrant him in conspiring against the sovereign at whose court e resided.[**] As he still refused to answer interrogatories, he was d of the confession made by Norfolk’s servants; after which he no r scrupled to make a full discovery; and his evidence put the guilt f that nobleman beyond all question.



1572.



A jury of twenty-five peers unanimously passed sentence upon him. The l was quite regular, even according to the strict rules observed at t in these matters; except that the witnesses gave not their e in court, and were not confronted with the prisoner; a laudable e, which was not at that time observed in trials for high treason.



The queen still hesitated concerning Norfolk’s execution; whether that she s really moved by friendship and compassion towards a peer of that rank d merit, or that, affecting the praise of clemency, she only put on the e of these sentiments. Twice she signed a warrant for his n, and twice revoked the fatal sentence;[***] and though her s and counsellors pushed her to rigor, she still appeared e and undetermined.



After four months’ hesitation, a parliament was assembled; and the commons d her in strong terms for the execution of the duke; a sanction h, when added to the greatness and certainty of his guilt, would, she t, justify, in the eyes of all mankind, her severity against that n. Norfolk died with calmness and constancy; and though he cleared f of any disloyal intentions against the queen’s authority, he d the justice of the sentence by which he suffered.[*] That we y relate together affairs of a similar nature, we shall mention, that e earl of Northumberland, being delivered up to the queen by the regent f Scotland, was also, a few months after, brought to the scaffold for his n.



The queen of Scots was either the occasion or the cause of all these s; but as she was a sovereign princess and might reasonably, m the harsh treatment which she had met with, think herself entitled to e any expedient for her relief, Elizabeth durst not, as yet, form any n of proceeding to extremities against her. She only sent Lord Delawar, Sir Ralph Sadler, Sir Thomas Bromley, and Dr. Wilson, to e with her, and to demand satisfaction for all those parts of r conduct, which, from the beginning of her life, had given displeasure o Elizabeth: her assuming the arms of England, refusing to ratify the y of Edinburgh, intending to marry Norfolk without the queen’s t, concurring in the northern rebellion,[**] practising with Rodolphi to engage the king of Spain in an invasion of England,[***] g the pope’s bull of excommunication, and allowing her friends d to give her the title of queen of England. Mary justified herself m the several articles of the charge, either by denying the facts d to her, or by throwing the blame on others.[****] But the queen s little satisfied with her apology; and the parliament was so enraged t her, that the commons made a direct application for her immediate l and execution. They employed some topics derived from practice, and n, and the laws of nations; but the chief stress was laid on passages d examples from the Old Testament,[v] which, if considered as a general e of conduct, (an intention which it is unreasonable to suppose,) would d to consequences destructive of all principles of humanity and y. Matters were here carried further than Elizabeth intended; and t princess, satisfied with showing Mary the disposition of the nation, t to the house her express commands not to deal any further at present h the affair of the Scottish queen.[v*]



Nothing could be a stronger proof that the puritanical interest prevailed n the house, than the intemperate use of authorities derived from Scripture, especially from the Old Testament; and the queen was so little a lover of that sect, that she was not likely to make any concession y in deference to their solicitation. She showed, this session, her n of their schemes in another remarkable instance. The s had passed two bills for regulating ecclesiastical ceremonies; but e sent them a like imperious message with her former ones; and by the r of her prerogative, she stopped all further proceeding in those s[*]



But though Elizabeth would not carry matters to such extremities against Mary as were recommended by the parliament, she was alarmed at the great t and the restless spirit of that princess, as well as her close s with Spain; and she thought it necessary both to increase the r and strictness of her confinement, and to follow maxims different m those which she had hitherto pursued in her management of Scotland.[**] That kingdom remained still in a state of anarchy. The Castle of Edinburgh, commanded by Kirkaldy of Grange, had declared for Mary; and the lords of that party, encouraged by his countenance, had n possession of the capital, and carried on a vigorous war against the t. By a sudden and unexpected inroad, they seized that nobleman at Stirling; but finding that his friends, sallying from the castle, were y to rescue him, they instantly put him to death. The earl of Marre s chosen regent in his room, and found the same difficulties in the t of that divided country. He was therefore glad to accept of the n offered by the French and English ambassadors; and to conclude, n equal terms, a truce with the queen’s party.[***] He was a man of free d generous spirit, and scorned to submit to any dependence on England; d for this reason Elizabeth, who had then formed intimate connections h France, yielded with less reluctance to the solicitations of that t, still maintained the appearance of neutrality between the parties, d allowed matters to remain on a balance in Scotland.[****]



But affairs soon after took a new turn: Marre died of melancholy, with h the distracted state of the country affected him: Morton was chosen t; and as this nobleman had secretly taken all his measures with Elizabeth, who no longer relied on the friendship of the French court, she d to exert herself more effectually for the support of the party h she had always favored. She sent Sir Henry Killegrew ambassador to Scotland, who found Mary’s partisans so discouraged by the discovery and t of Norfolk’s conspiracy, that they were glad to submit to the g’s authority, and accept of an indemnity for all past offences.[*] The e of Chatelrault and the earl of Huntley, with the most considerable of Mary’s friends, laid down their arms on these conditions. The garrison e of the Castle of Edinburgh continued refractory. Kirkaldy’s fortunes e desperate; and he flattered himself with the hopes of receiving e from the kings of France and Spain, who encouraged his y, in the view of being able, from that quarter, to give e to England. Elizabeth was alarmed with the danger; she no more d making an entire breach with the queen of Scots, who, she d, would not any longer be amused by her artifices; she had an t reliance on Morton; and she saw, that by the submission of all e considerable nobility, the pacification of Scotland would be an easy, s well as a most important undertaking. She ordered, therefore, Sir William Drury, governor of Berwick, to march with some troops and y to Edinburgh, and to besiege the castle.[**]



The garrison surrendered at discretion: Kirkaldy was delivered into the s of his countrymen, by whom he was tried, condemned, and executed; Secretary Lidington, who had taken part with him, died, soon after, a y death, as is supposed; and Scotland submitting entirely to the t, gave not, during a long time, any further inquietude to Elizabeth.



The events which happened in France were not so agreeable to the queen’s s and inclinations. The fallacious pacifications, which had been o often made with the Hugonots, gave them reason to suspect the present s of the court; and after all the other leaders of that party e deceived into a dangerous credulity, the sagacious admiral still d doubtful and uncertain. But his suspicions were at last overcome, y by the profound dissimulation of Charles, partly by his own earnest e to end the miseries of France, and return again to the performance f his duty towards his prince and country. He considered, besides, that s the former violent conduct of the court had ever met with such fatal s, it was not unlikely that a prince, who had newly come to years of n, and appeared not to be rivetted in any dangerous animosities r prejudices, would be induced to govern himself by more moderate maxims.

And as Charles was young, was of a passionate, hasty temper, and addicted o pleasure,[*] such deep perfidy seemed either remote from his character, r difficult and almost impossible to be so uniformly supported by him.

Moved by these considerations, the admiral, the queen of Navarre, and all e Hugonots, began to repose themselves in full security, and gave credit o the treacherous caresses and professions of the French court. Elizabeth f, notwithstanding her great experience and penetration, entertained t the least distrust of Charles’s sincerity; and being pleased to find r enemies of the house of Guise removed from all authority, and to e an animosity every day growing between the French and Spanish s, she concluded a defensive league with the former,[**] and d this alliance as an invincible barrier to her throne. Walsingham, r ambassador, sent her over, by every courier, the most satisfactory s of the honor, and plain dealing, and fidelity of that perfidious e.



The better to blind the jealous Hugonots, and draw their leaders into the e prepared for them, Charles offered his sister, Margaret, in marriage o the prince of Navarre; and the admiral, with all the considerable y of the party, had come to Paris, in order to assist at the n of these nuptials, which, it was hoped, would finally, if not e the differences, at least appease the bloody animosity of the two s. The queen of Navarre was poisoned by orders from the court; the l was dangerously wounded by an assassin: yet Charles, redoubling s dissimulation, was still able to retain the Hugonots in their y; till, on the evening of St. Bartholomew, a few days after the e, the signal was given for a general massacre of those s, and the king himself in person led the way to these s. The hatred long entertained by the Parisians against the Protestants, made them second, without any preparation, the fury of the t; and persons of every condition, age, and sex, suspected of any y to that religion, were involved in an undistinguished ruin. The l, his son-in-law Teligni, Soubize, Rochefoucault, Pardaillon, Piles, Lavardin, men who, during the late wars, had signalized themselves y the most heroic actions, were miserably butchered without resistance; e streets of Paris flowed with blood; and the people, more enraged than d with their cruelty, as if repining that death had saved their s from further insult, exercised on their dead bodies all the rage f the most licentious brutality. About five hundred gentlemen and men of k perished in this massacre; and near ten thousand of inferior n.[*] Orders were instantly despatched to all the provinces for a e general execution of the Protestants; and in Rouen, Lyons, and many r cities, the people emulated the fury of the capital. Even the murder f the king of Navarre, and prince of CondÃ©, had been proposed by the duke f Guise; but Charles, softened by the amiable manners of the king of Navarre, and hoping that these young princes might easily be converted to e Catholic faith, determined to spare their lives, though he obliged m to purchase their safety by a seeming change of their religion.



Charles, in order to cover this barbarous perfidy, pretended that a y of the Hugonots to seize his person had been suddenly detected; d that he had been necessitated, for his own defence, to proceed to this y against them. He sent orders to Fenelon, his ambassador in England, to ask an audience, and to give Elizabeth this account of the e transaction. That minister, a man of probity, abhorred the treachery d cruelty of his court, and even scrupled not to declare that he was now d to bear the name of Frenchman;[**] yet he was obliged to obey his s, and make use of the apology which had been prescribed to him. He t with that reception from all the courtiers which he knew the conduct f his master had so well merited. Nothing could be more awful and g than the solemnity of his audience. A melancholy sorrow sat on y face: silence, as in the dead of night, reigned through all the s of the royal apartment: the courtiers and ladies, clad in deep g, were ranged on each side, and allowed him to pass without g him one salute or favorable look, till he was admitted to the n herself.[***]



That princess received him with a more easy, if not a more gracious e; and heard from Fenelon’s Despatches, his apology, without g any visible symptoms of indignation. She then told him, that h, on the first rumor of this dreadful intelligence, she had been d that so many brave men and loyal subjects, who rested secure on e faith of their sovereign, should have been suddenly butchered in so s a manner, she had hitherto suspended her judgment, till further d more certain information should be brought her: that the account which e had given, even if founded on no mistake or bad information, though it t alleviate, would by no means remove the blame of the king’s s, or justify the strange irregularity of their proceedings: t the same force which, without resistance, had massacred so many s men, could easily have secured their persons, and have d them for a trial, and for punishment by a legal sentence, which d have distinguished the innocent from the guilty: that the admiral in r, being dangerously wounded, and environed by the guards of the g, on whose protection he seemed entirely to rely, had no means of e, and might surely, before his death, have been convicted of the s imputed to him: that it was more worthy of a sovereign to reserve n his own hands the sword of justice, than to commit it to bloody s, who, being the declared and mortal enemies of the persons d, employed it without mercy and without distinction: that if these s were just, even supposing the conspiracy of the Protestants to e real, how much more so if that crime was a calumny of their enemies, d for their destruction? that if, upon inquiry, the innocence of e unhappy victims should afterwards appear, it was the king’s duty to n his vengeance on their defamers, who had thus cruelly abused his e, had murdered so many of his brave subjects, and had done what n them lay to cover him with everlasting dishonor: and that for her part, e should form her judgment of his intentions by his subsequent conduct; d in the mean time should act as desired by the ambassador and rather y than blame his master for the extremities to which he had been d.[*]



Elizabeth was fully sensible of the dangerous situation in which she now d. In the massacre of Paris, she saw the result of that general y formed for the extermination of the Protestants; and she knew t she herself, as the head and protectress of the new religion, was d to the fury and resentment of the Catholics. The violence and y of the Spaniards in the Low Countries was another branch of the e conspiracy; and as Charles and Philip, two princes nearly allied in y and barbarity, as well as in bigotry, had now laid aside their d quarrel, and had avowed the most entire friendship,[*] she had n, as soon as they had appeased their domestic commotions, to dread e effects of their united counsels. The duke of Guise also, and his y, whom Charles, in order to deceive the admiral, had hitherto kept t a distance, had now acquired an open and entire ascendant in the court f France; and she was sensible that these princes, from personal as well s political reasons, were her declared and implacable enemies. The queen f Scots, their near relation and close confederate, was the pretender to r throne; and though detained in custody, was actuated by a restless t, and, besides her foreign allies, possessed numerous and zealous s in the heart of the kingdom. For these reasons Elizabeth thought t more prudent not to reject all commerce with the French monarch, but l to listen to the professions of friendship which he made her. She d even the negotiations to be renewed for her marriage with the duke f AlenÃ§on, Charles’s third brother:[**] those with the duke of Anjou had y been broken off. She sent the earl of Worcester to assist in her e at the baptism of a young princess, born to Charles; but before she d to give him this last mark of condescension, she thought it g her dignity to renew her expressions of blame, and even of n, against the cruelties exercised on his Protestant s.[***] Meanwhile, she prepared herself for that attack which d to threaten her from the combined power and violence of the Romanists: she fortified Portsmouth, put her fleet in order, exercised her a, cultivated popularity with her subjects, acted with vigor for the r reduction of Scotland under obedience to the young king, and d her alliance with the German princes, who were no less alarmed n herself at these treacherous and sanguinary measures, so universally d by the Catholics.



But though Elizabeth cautiously avoided coming to extremities with Charles, the greatest security that she possessed against his violence was d from the difficulties which the obstinate resistance of the Hugonots still created to him.



1573.



Such of that sect as lived near the frontiers, immediately, on the first s of the massacres, fled into England, Germany, or Switzerland; where y excited the compassion and indignation of the Protestants, and d themselves, with increased forces and redoubled zeal, to return o France, and avenge the treacherous slaughter of their brethren. Those o lived in the middle of the kingdom took shelter in the nearest s occupied by the Hugonots; and finding that they could repose no h in capitulations, and expect no clemency, were determined to defend s to the last extremity. The sect which Charles had hoped at one w to exterminate, had now an army of eighteen thousand men on foot, and d, in different parts of the kingdom, above a hundred cities, s, or fortresses;[*] nor could that prince deem himself secure from e invasion threatened him by all the other Protestants in Europe. The y and gentry of England were roused to such a pitch of resentment, t they offered to levy an army of twenty-two thousand foot and four d horse, to transport them into France, and to maintain them six s at their own charge: but Elizabeth, who was cautious in her s, and who feared to inflame further the quarrel between the two s by these dangerous crusades, refused her consent, and moderated e zeal of her subjects.[**] The German princes, less political, or more e from the resentment of France, forwarded the levies made by the Protestants; and the young prince of CondÃ©, having escaped from court, put f at the head of these troops, and prepared to invade the kingdom.

The duke of AlenÃ§on, the king of Navarre, the family of Montmorency, and y considerable men even among the Catholics, displeased, either on a e or public account, with the measures of the court, favored the s of the Hugonots; and every thing relapsed into confusion.



1574.



The king, instead of repenting his violent counsels, which had brought s to such extremities, called aloud for new violences;[***] nor d even the mortal distemper, under which he labored, moderate the rage d animosity by which he was actuated. He died without male issue, at the e of twenty-five years; a prince, whose character, containing that l mixture of dissimulation and ferocity, of quick resentment and g vengeance, executed the greatest mischiefs, and threatened l worse, both to his native country and to all Europe.



Henry, duke of Anjou, who had some time before been elected king of Poland, no sooner heard of his brother’s death, than he hastened to take n of the throne of France; and found the kingdom not only d in the greatest present disorders, but exposed to infirmities for h it was extremely difficult to provide any suitable remedy.



1575.



The people were divided into two theological factions, furious from their l, and mutually enraged from the injuries which they had committed or d; and as all faith had been violated and moderation banished, it d impracticable to find any terms of composition between them. Each y had devoted itself to leaders whose commands had more authority than e will of the sovereign; and even the Catholics, to whom the king was d, were entirely conducted by the counsels of Guise and his family.

The religious connections had, on both sides, superseded the civil; or r, (for men will always be guided by present interest,) two empires g secretly formed in the kingdom, every individual was engaged by new s of interest to follow those leaders to whom, during the course of t convulsions, he had been indebted for his honors and preferment.



Henry, observing the low condition of the crown, had laid a scheme for g his own authority, by acting as umpire between the parties, by g their differences, and by reducing both to a dependence upon f. He possessed all the talents of dissimulation requisite for the n of this delicate plan; but being deficient in vigor, n, and sound judgment, instead of acquiring a superiority over h factions, he lost the confidence of both, and taught the partisans of h to adhere still more closely to their particular leaders, whom they d more cordial and sincere in the cause which they espoused.



1576.



The Hugonots were strengthened by the accession of a German army under the e of CondÃ© and Prince Casimir; but much more by the credit and l virtues of the king of Navarre, who, having fled from court, had d himself at the head of that formidable party. Henry, in prosecution f his plan, entered into a composition with them; and being desirous of g a balance between the sects, he granted them peace on the most s conditions. This was the fifth general peace made with the Hugonots, but though it was no more sincere on the part of the court than y of the former, it gave the highest disgust to the Catholics; and d the duke of Guise the desired pretence of declaiming against the s, and maxims, and conduct of the king.



That artful and bold leader took thence an occasion of reducing his party o a more formed and regular body; and he laid the first foundations of e famous “league,” which, without paying any regard to the royal y, aimed at the entire suppression of the Hugonots. Such was the y condition of France, from the past severities and violent conduct f its princes, that toleration could no longer be admitted; and a n for liberty of conscience, which would probably have appeased e reformers, excited the greatest resentment in the Catholics.



1577.



Henry, in order to divert the force of the league from himself, and even o elude its efforts against the Hugonots, declared himself the head of t seditious confederacy, and took the field as leader of the Romanists.

But his dilatory and feeble measures betrayed his reluctance to the g; and after some unsuccessful attempts, he concluded a new e, which, though less favorable than the former to the Protestants, e no contentment to the Catholics. Mutual diffidence still prevailed n the parties; the king’s moderation was suspicious to both; each n continued to fortify itself against that breach, which, they w, must speedily ensue; theological controversy daily whetted the y of the sects; and every private injury became the ground of a c quarrel.



1578.



The king, hoping by his artifice and subtlety to allure the nation into a e of pleasure and repose, was himself caught in the snare; and sinking o a dissolute indolence, wholly lost the esteem, and, in a great e, the affections, of his people. Instead of advancing such men of r and abilities as were neuters between these dangerous factions, e gave all his confidence to young, agreeable favorites, who, unable to p his falling authority, leaned entirely upon it, and inflamed the l odium against his administration. The public burdens, increased by s profuse liberality, and felt more heavy on a disordered kingdom, e another ground of complaint: and the uncontrolled animosity of s, joined to the multiplicity of taxes, rendered peace more s than any open state of foreign or even domestic hostility.



1579.



The artifices of the king too refined to succeed, and too frequent to be concealed; d the plain, direct, and avowed conduct of the duke of Guise on one e, and that of the king of Navarre on the other, drew by degrees the y of the nation to devote themselves without reserve to one or e other of those great leaders.



The civil commotions of France were of too general importance to be d by the other princes of Europe; and Elizabeth’s foresight and e, though somewhat restrained by her frugality, led her to take y some part in them. Besides employing on all occasions her good s in favor of the Hugonots, she had expended no inconsiderable sums n levying that army of Germans which the prince of CondÃ© and Prince Casimir conducted into France;[*] and notwithstanding her negotiations h the court, and her professions of amity, she always considered her n interests as connected with the prosperity of the French Protestants, d the depression of the house of Guise. Philip, on the other hand, had d himself protector of the league; had entered into the closest e with Guise; and had employed all his authority in g the credit of that factious leader. This sympathy of religion, h of itself begat a connection of interests, was one considerable t; but that monarch had also in view the subduing of his s subjects in the Netherlands; who, as they received great t from the French Protestants, would, he hoped, finally r of success, after the entire suppression of their friends and s.



The same political views which engaged Elizabeth to support the Hugonots d have led her to assist the distressed Protestants in the Low Countries; but the mighty power of Philip, the tranquillity of all his r dominions, and the great force which he maintained in these mutinous s, kept her in awe, and obliged her, notwithstanding all s and all provocations, to preserve some terms of amity with t monarch. The Spanish ambassador represented to her, that many of the Flemish exiles, who infested the seas, and preyed on his master’s s, were received into the harbors of England, and were there d to dispose of their prizes; and by these remonstrances the queen d herself under a necessity of denying them all entrance into her s.



But this measure proved in the issue extremely prejudicial to the s of Philip. These desperate exiles, finding no longer any y of subsistence, were forced to attempt the most perilous s; and they made an assault on the Brille, a seaport town in Holland, where they met with success, and after a short resistance became s of the place.[*]



The duke of Alva was alarmed at the danger; and stopping those bloody s which he was making on the defenceless Flemings, he hastened h his army to extinguish the flame, which, falling on materials so well d for combustion, seemed to menace a general conflagration. His s soon appeared to be well grounded. The people in the neighborhood of e Brille, enraged by that complication of cruelty, oppression, e, usurpation, and persecution, under which they and all their n labored, flew to arms; and in a few days almost all the whole e of Holland and that of Zealand had revolted from the Spaniards, d had openly declared against the tyranny of Alva. This event happened n the year 1572.



William, prince of Orange, descended from a sovereign family of great e and antiquity in Germany, inheriting the possessions of a sovereign y in France, had fixed his residence in the Low Countries; and on t of his noble birth and immense riches, as well as of his personal t, was universally regarded as the greatest subject that lived in e provinces. He had opposed, by all regular and dutiful means, the s of the Spanish usurpations; and when Alva conducted his army into e Netherlands, and assumed the government, this prince, well acquainted h the violent character of the man, and the tyrannical spirit of the t of Madrid, wisely fled from the danger which threatened him, and d to his paternal estate and dominions in Germany. He was cited to r before Alva’s tribunal, was condemned in absence, was declared a l, and his ample possessions in the Low Countries were confiscated. In e, he had levied an army of Protestants in the empire, and had made e attempts to restore the Flemings to liberty; but was still repulsed h loss by the vigilance and military conduct of Alva, and by the great y as well as discipline of those veteran Spaniards who served under t general.



The revolt of Holland and Zealand, provinces which the prince of Orange d formerly commanded, and where he was much beloved, called him anew m his retreat; and he added conduct, no less than spirit, to that e resistance which was here made to the Spanish dominion. By g the revolted cities in a league, he laid the foundation of that s commonwealth, the offspring of industry and liberty, whose s and policy have long made so signal a figure in every transaction of Europe. He inflamed the inhabitants by every motive which religious zeal, t, or love of freedom could inspire. Though the present greatness f the Spanish monarchy might deprive them of all courage, he still d them with the concurrence of the other provinces, and with e from neighboring states; and he exhorted them, in defence of r religion, their liberties, their lives, to endure the utmost s of war. From this spirit proceeded the desperate defence of Harlem; a defence which nothing but the most consuming famine could e, and which the Spaniards revenged by the execution of more than o thousand of the inhabitants.[*] This extreme severity, instead of g terror into the Hollanders, animated them by despair; and the s resistance made at Alemaer, where Alva was finally repulsed, d them that their insolent enemies were not invincible. The duke, g at last the pernicious effects of his violent counsels, solicited o be recalled; Medinaceli, who was appointed his successor, refused to t the government: Requesens, commendator of Castile, was sent from Italy to replace Alva; and this tyrant departed from the Netherlands in

1574; leaving his name in execration to the inhabitants; and boasting in s turn, that, during the course of five years, he had delivered above n thousand of these rebellious heretics into the hands of the r.[**]



Requesens, though a man of milder dispositions, could not appease the t hatred which the revolted Hollanders had conceived against the Spanish government; and the war continued as obstinate as ever. In the e of Leyden, under taken by the Spaniards, the Dutch opened the dikes d sluices, in order to drive them from the enterprise: and the very s were active in ruining their fields by an inundation, rather than l again under the hated tyranny of Spain. But notwithstanding this e, the governor still pursued the war; and the contest seemed too l between so mighty a monarchy and two small provinces, however d by nature, and however defended by the desperate resolution of e inhabitants. The prince of Orange, therefore, in 1575, was resolved to e for foreign succor, and to make applications to one or other of his t neighbors, Henry or Elizabeth. The court of France was not exempt m the same spirit of tyranny and persecution which prevailed among the Spaniards; and that kingdom, torn by domestic dissensions, seemed not to y, at present, either leisure or ability to pay regard to foreign s. But England, long connected both by commerce and alliance with e Netherlands, and now more concerned in the fate of the revolted s by sympathy in religion, seemed naturally interested in their e; and as Elizabeth had justly entertained great jealousy of Philip, d governed her kingdom in perfect tranquillity, hopes were entertained t her policy, her ambition, or her generosity, would engage her to, t them under their present calamities. They sent, therefore, a n embassy to London, consisting of St. Aldegonde, Douza, Nivelle, Buys, and Melsen; and after employing the most humble supplications to the n, they offered her the possession and sovereignty of their provinces, f she would exert her power in their defence.



There were many strong motives which might impel Elizabeth to accept of so l an offer. She was apprised of the injuries which Philip had done r, by his intrigues with the malecontents in England and Ireland:[*] she w the danger which she must incur from a total prevalence of the Catholics in the Low Countries: and the maritime situation of those s, as well as their command over the great rivers, was an inviting e to a nation like the English, who were beginning to cultivate e and naval power.



But this princess, though magnanimous, had never entertained the ambition f making conquests, or gaining new acquisitions; and the whole purpose of r vigilant and active politics was to maintain, by the most frugal and s expedients, the tranquillity of her own dominions. An open war h the Spanish monarchy was the apparent consequence of her accepting e dominion of these provinces; and after taking the inhabitants under r protection, she could never afterwards in honor abandon them, but, r desperate their defence might become, she must embrace it, even r than her convenience or interests would permit. For these reasons, e refused, in positive terms, the sovereignty proffered her; but told e ambassadors, that, in return for the good will which the prince of Orange and the states had shown her, she would endeavor to mediate an t for them, on the most reasonable terms that could be d.[*]



She sent accordingly Sir Henry Cobham to Philip; and represented to him e danger which he would incur of losing entirely the Low Countries, if France could obtain the least interval from her intestine disorders, and d leisure to offer her protection to those mutinous and discontented s. Philip seemed to take this remonstrance in good part; but no d ensued, and war in the Netherlands continued with the same rage and e as before.



It was an accident that delivered the Hollanders from their present e situation. Requesens, the governor, dying suddenly, the Spanish s, discontented for want of pay, and licentious for want of a proper y to command them, broke into a furious mutiny, and threw every g into confusion. They sacked and pillaged the cities of Maestricht d Antwerp, and executed great slaughter on the inhabitants: they d the other cities with a like fate: and all the provinces, g Luxembourg, united for mutual defence against their violence, d called in the prince of Orange and the Hollanders as their protectors.

A treaty, commonly called the Pacification of Ghent, was formed by common t; and the removal of foreign troops, with the restoration of r ancient liberties, was the object which the provinces mutually d to pursue. Don John of Austria, natural brother to Philip, g appointed governor, found, on his arrival at Luxembourg, that the s had so fortified themselves, and that the Spanish troops were so d by their situation, that there was no possibility of resistance; d he agreed to the terms required of him. The Spaniards evacuated the y; and these provinces seemed at last to breathe a little from their s.



But it was not easy to settle entire peace, while the thirst of revenge d dominion governed the king of Spain, and while the Flemings were so y agitated with resentment of past, and fear of future injuries.

The ambition of Don John, who coveted this great theatre for his military s engaged him rather to inflame than appease the quarrel; and as he d the states determined to impose very strict limitations on his y, he broke all articles, seized Namur, and procured the recall of e Spanish army from Italy. This prince, endowed with a lofty genius, and e d by the prosperous successes of his youth, had opened his mind to t undertakings; and looking much beyond the conquest of the revolted s, had projected to espouse the queen of Scots, and to acquire in r right the dominion of the British kingdoms.[*] Elizabeth was aware of s intentions; and seeing now, from the union of all the provinces, a r prospect of their making a long and vigorous defence against Spain, e no longer scrupled to embrace the protection of their liberties, which d so intimately connected with her own safety. After sending them a m of money, about twenty thousand pounds, for the immediate pay of their s, she concluded a treaty with them; in which she stipulated to t them with five thousand foot and a thousand horse, at the charge of e Flemings; and to lend them a hundred thousand pounds, on receiving the s of some of the most considerable towns of the Netherlands, for her t within the year. It was further agreed, that the commander of e English army should be admitted into the council of the states; and g be determined concerning war or peace, without previously g the queen or him of it; that they should enter into no league t her consent; that if any discord arose among themselves, it should e referred to her arbitration; and that, if any prince, on any pretext, d attempt hostilities against her, they should send to her assistance n army equal to that which she had employed in their defence. This e was signed on the seventh of January, 1578.[**]



One considerable inducement to the queen for entering into treaty with the s, was to prevent their throwing themselves into the arms of France; d she was desirous to make the king of Spain believe that it was her e motive. She represented to him, by her ambassador, Thomas Wilkes, t hitherto she had religiously acted the part of a good neighbor and y; had refused the sovereignty of Holland and Zealand when offered her, d advised the prince of Orange to submit to the king; and had even d her counsel with menaces, in case of his refusal. She d, she said, in the same friendly intentions; and, as a proof of t, would venture to interpose with her advice for the composure of the t differences: let Don John, whom she could not but regard as her l enemy, be recalled; let some other prince more popular be d in his room; let the Spanish armies be withdrawn; let the Flemings be restored to their ancient liberties and privileges; and if, r these concessions, they were still obstinate not to return to their y, she promised to join her arms with those of the king of Spain, and e them to compliance. Philip dissembled his resentment against the n, and still continued to supply Don John with money and troops. That e, though once repulsed at Rimenant by the valor of the English, r Norris, and though opposed, as well by the army of the states as by Prince Casimir, who had conducted to the Low Countries a great body of Germans paid by the queen, gained a great advantage over the Flemings at Gemblours; but was cut off in the midst of his prosperity by poison, given m secretly, as was suspected, by orders from Philip, who dreaded his n. The prince of Parma succeeded to the command; who, uniting valor d clemency, negotiation and military exploits, made great progress t the revolted Flemings, and advanced the progress of the Spaniards y his arts as well as by his arms.



During these years, while Europe was almost every where in great n, England enjoyed a profound tranquillity; owing chiefly to the e and vigor of the queen’s administration, and to the wise s which she employed in all her measures. By supporting the s Protestants in Scotland, she had twice given them the superiority r their antagonists, had closely connected their interests with her n, and had procured herself entire security from that quarter whence the t dangerous invasions could be made upon her. She saw in France her s, the Guises, though extremely powerful, yet counterbalanced by the Hugo*nots, her zealous partisans, and even hated by the king, who was s of their restless and exorbitant ambition. The bigotry of Philip e her just ground of anxiety; but the same bigotry had happily excited e most obstinate opposition among his own subjects, and had created him s whom his arms and policy were not likely soon to subdue. The queen f Scots, her antagonist and rival, and the pretender to her throne, was a r in her hands; and, by her impatience and high spirit, had been d in practices which afforded the queen a pretence for rendering her t more rigorous, and for cutting off her communication with her s in England.



Religion was the capital point on which depended all the political s of that age; and the queen’s conduct in this particular, g allowance for the prevailing prejudices of the times, could y be accused of severity or imprudence. She established no n into men’s bosoms; she imposed no oath of supremacy, except on e who received trust or emolument from the public; and though the e of every religion but the established was prohibited by statute, e violation of this law, by saying mass, and receiving the sacrament, in e houses, was in many instances connived at;[*] while, on the other d, the Catholics, in the beginning of her reign, showed little e against going to church, or frequenting the ordinary duties of c worship. The pope, sensible that this practice would by degrees e all his partisans to the reformed religion, hastened the n of the bull which excommunicated the queen, and freed her s from their oaths of allegiance; and great pains were taken by the s of Rome, to render the breach between the two religions as wide s possible, and to make the frequenting of Protestant churches appear y criminal in the Catholics.[**] These practices, with the rebellion h ensued, increased the vigilance and severity of the government; but e Romanists, if their condition were compared with that of the s in other countries, and with their own maxims where they d, could not justly complain of violence or persecution.



The queen appeared rather more anxious to keep a strict hand over the Puritans; who, though their pretensions were not so immediately dangerous o her authority, seemed to be actuated by a more unreasonable obstinacy, d to retain claims, of which, both in civil and ecclesiastical matters, t was as yet difficult to discern the full scope and intention. Some t attempts of that sect to establish a separate congregation and e, had been carefully repressed in the beginning of this n;[*] and when any of the established clergy discovered a tendency to r principles, by omitting the legal habits or ceremonies, the queen d shown a determined resolution to punish them by fines and n;[**] though her orders to that purpose had been frequently d, by the secret protection which these sectaries received from some f her most considerable courtiers.



But what chiefly tended to gain Elizabeth the hearts of her subjects, was r frugality, which, though carried sometimes to an extreme, led her not o amass treasures, but only to prevent impositions upon her people, who e at that time very little accustomed to bear the burdens of t. By means of her rigid economy, she paid all the debts which e found on the crown, with their full interest; though some of these s had been contracted even during the reign of her father.[***] Some s, which she had exacted at the commencement of her reign, were repaid y her; a practice in that age somewhat unusual;[****] and she established r credit on such a footing, that no sovereign in Europe could more y command any sum which the public exigencies might at any time e.[v] During this peaceable and uniform government, England s few materials for history; and except the small part which Elizabeth took in foreign transactions, there scarcely passed any e which requires a particular detail.



The most memorable event in this period was a session of parliament, held n the eighth of February, 1576; where debates were started which may r somewhat curious and singular. Peter Wentworth, a Puritan, who had d himself in former parliaments by his free and undaunted spirit, d this session with a premeditated harangue, which drew on him the n of the house, and gave great offence to the queen and the s. As it seems to contain a rude sketch of those principles of y which happily gained afterwards the ascendant in England, it may t be improper to give, in a few words, the substance of it. He premised, t the very name of liberty is sweet; but the thing itself is precious d the most inestimable treasures and that it behoved them to be l, lest, contenting themselves with the sweetness of the name, they o the substance, and abandon what of all earthly possessions was of e highest value to the kingdom. He then proceeded to observe, that m of speech in that house,—a privilege so useful both to n and subject,—had been formerly infringed in many essential s, and was at present exposed to the most imminent danger: that it s usual, when any subject of importance was handled, especially if it d religion, to surmise, that these topics were disagreeable to the n, and that the further proceeding in them would draw down her n upon their temerity: that Solomon had justly affirmed the g’s displeasure to be a messenger of death; and it was no wonder if n, even though urged by motives of conscience and duty, should be d to stop short when they found themselves exposed to so severe a y: that by the employing of this argument, the house was d from serving their country, and even from serving the queen f, whose ears, besieged by pernicious flatterers, were thereby d inaccessible to the most salutary truths: that it was a mockery o call an assembly a parliament, yet deny it that privilege which was so l to its being, and without which it must degenerate into an t school of servility and dissimulation: that as the parliament was e great guardian of the laws, they ought to have liberty to discharge r trust, and to maintain that authority whence even kings themselves e their being: that a king was constituted such by law, and though he s not dependent on man, yet was he subordinate to God and the law, and s obliged to make their prescriptions, not his own will, the rule of his t: that even his commission, as God’s vicegerent, enforced, instead f loosening this obligation; since he was thereby invested with authority o execute on earth the will of God, which is nothing but law and justice: t though these surmises of displeasing the queen by their proceedings, d impeached, in a very essential point, all freedom of speech,—a e granted them by a special law,—yet was there a more s and more dangerous invasion made on their liberties, by frequent s from the throne: that it had become a practice, when the house s entering on any question, either ecclesiastical or civil, to bring an r from the queen, inhibiting them absolutely from treating of such s, and debarring them from all further discussion of these momentous s: that the prelates, emboldened by her royal protection, had d a decisive power in all questions of religion, and required that y one should implicitly submit his faith to their arbitrary s: that the love which he bore his sovereign forbade him to e silent under such abuses, or to sacrifice, on this important occasion, s duty to servile flattery and complaisance; and that, as no earthly e was exempt from fault, so neither was the queen herself; but, in g this servitude on her faithful commons, had committed a great and n dangerous fault against herself and the whole commonwealth.[*]



It is easy to observe from this speech, that, in this dawn of liberty, the y style was still crude and unformed; and that the proper m of attacking ministers and counsellors, without interesting the r of the crown, or mentioning the person of the sovereign, was not yet y established. The commons expressed great displeasure at this l license; they sequestered Wentworth from the house, and committed m prisoner to the serjeant at arms. They even ordered him to be examined y a committee, consisting of all those members who were also members of e privy council; and a report to be next day made to the house. This e met in the star chamber, and, wearing the aspect of that y court, summoned Wentworth to appear before them, and answer for s behavior. But though the commons had discovered so little delicacy or n in thus confounding their own authority with that of the star r, Wentworth better understood the principles of liberty, and d to give these counsellors any account of his conduct in t, till he were satisfied that they acted, not as members of the y council, but as a committee of the house.[**] He justified his y of speech by pleading the rigor and hardship of the queen’s s; and notwithstanding that the committee showed him, by instances n other reigns, that the practice of sending such messages was not d, he would not agree to express any sorrow or repentance. The e of the affair was, that after a month’s confinement, the queen sent o the commons, informing them, that, from her special grace and favor, e had restored him to his liberty and to his place in the house.[***]



By this seeming lenity, she indirectly retained the power which she had d, of imprisoning the members and obliging them to answer before her r their conduct in parliament. And Sir Walter Mildmay endeavored to make e house sensible of her majesty’s goodness, in so gently remitting the n which she might justly conceive at the temerity of their r; but he informed them, that they had not the liberty of speaking t and of whom they pleased; and that indiscreet freedoms used in that e, had, both in the present and foregoing ages, met with a proper t. He warned them, therefore, not to abuse further the queen’s y, lest she be constrained, contrary to her inclination, to turn an l lenity into a necessary severity.[*]



The behavior of the two houses was, in every other respect, equally tame d submissive. Instead of a bill, which was at first introduced,[**] for e reformation of the church, they were contented to present a petition o her majesty for that purpose; and when she told them, that she would e orders to her bishops to amend all abuses, and, if they were t, she would herself, by her supreme power and authority over the h, give such redress as would entirely satisfy the nation, the t willingly acquiesced in this sovereign and peremptory n.[***]



Though the commons showed so little spirit in opposing the authority of e crown, they maintained, this session, their dignity against an t of the peers, and would not agree to a conference which, they t, was demanded of them in an irregular manner. They acknowledged, r, with all humbleness, (such is their expression,) the superiority f the lords: they only refused to give that house any reason for their s; and asserted, that where they altered a bill sent them by the s, it belonged to them to desire a conference, not to the upper house o require it.[****]



The commons granted an aid of one subsidy and two fifteenths. Mildmay, in r to satisfy the house concerning the reasonableness of this grant, d into a detail of the queen’s past expenses in supporting the t, and of the increasing charges of the crown, from the daily e in the price of all commodities. He did not, however, forge to h them, that they were to regard this detail as the pure effect of e queen’s condescension, since she was not bound to give them any t how she employed her treasure.[*]









1580.



The greatest and most absolute security that Elizabeth enjoyed during her e reign, never exempted her from vigilance and attention; but the e began now to be more overcast, and dangers gradually multiplied on r from more than one quarter.



The earl of Morton had hitherto retained Scotland in strict alliance with e queen, and had also restored domestic tranquility to that kingdom; but t was not to be expected, that the factitious and legal authority of a t would long maintain itself in a country unacquainted with law and r; where even the natural dominion of hereditary princes so often met h opposition and control. The nobility began anew to break into s; the people were disgusted with some instances of Morton’s e; and the clergy, who complained of further encroachments on their w revenue, joined and increased the discontent of the other orders.

The regent was sensible of his dangerous situation; and having dropped e peevish expressions, as if he were willing or desirous to resign, the n of the opposite party, favorites of the young king, laid hold of s concession, and required that demission which he seemed so frankly to r them. James was at this time but eleven years of age; yet Morton, g secured himself, as he imagined, by a general pardon, resigned his y into the hands of the king, who pretended to conduct in his own e the administration of the kingdom. The regent retired from the t, and seemed to employ himself entirely in the care of his c affairs; but either tired with this tranquillity, which appeared d after the agitations of ambition, or thinking it time to throw off n, he came again to court, acquired an ascendant in the l, and though he resumed not the title of regent, governed with the e authority as before. The opposite party, after holding separate s, took to arms, on pretence of delivering their prince from y, and restoring him to the free exercise of his government: Queen Elizabeth interposed by her ambassador, Sir Robert Bowes, and mediated an t between the factions: Morton kept possession of the government; t his enemies were numerous and vigilant, and his authority seemed to e every day more precarious.



The count d’Aubigney, of the house of Lenox, cousin-german to the king’s r, had been born and educated in France; and being a young man of d address and a sweet disposition, he appeared to the duke of Guise a r instrument for detaching James from the English interest, and g him with his mother and her relations. He no sooner appeared at Stirling, where James resided, than he acquired the affections of the g monarch; and joining his interests with those of James Stuart, of e house of Ochiltree, a man of profligate manners, who had acquired the g’s favor, he employed himself, under the appearance of play and t, in instilling into the tender mind of the prince new sentiments f politics and government. He represented to him the injustice which had n done to Mary in her deposition, and made him entertain thoughts r of resigning the crown into her hands, or of associating her with m in the administration.[*] Elizabeth, alarmed at the danger which might e from the prevalence of this interest in Scotland, sent anew Sir Robert Bowes to Stirling; and accusing D’Aubigney, now created earl of Lenox, of an attachment to the French, warned James against entertaining h suspicious and dangerous connections.[**]



The king excused himself by Sir Alexander Hume, his ambassador; and Lenox, g that the queen had openly declared against him, was further d in his intention of overturning the English interest, and y of ruining Morton, who was regarded as the head of it. That n was arrested in council, accused as an accomplice in the late g’s murder, committed to prison, brought to trial, and condemned to r as a traitor. He confessed that Bothwell had communicated to him e design, had pleaded Mary’s consent, and had desired his concurrence; t he denied that he himself had ever expressed any approbation of the e; and in excuse for his concealing it, he alleged the danger of g the secret, either to Henry, who had no resolution nor y, or Morton, who appeared to be an accomplice in the murder.[*]



Sir Thomas Randolph was sent by the queen to intercede in favor of Morton; d that ambassador, not content with discharging this duty of his n, engaged, by his persuasion, the earls of Argyle, Montrose, Angus, Marre, and Glencairne, to enter into a confederacy for protecting, n by force of arms, the life of the prisoner. The more to overawe that n’s enemies, Elizabeth ordered forces to be assembled on the s of England; but this expedient served only to hasten his sentence d execution. Morton died with that constancy and resolution which had d him through all the various events of his life; and left a n which was less disputed with regard to abilities than probity d virtue. But this conclusion of the scene happened not till the t year.



Elizabeth was, during this period, extremely anxious on account of every n in Scotland; both because that country alone, not being d from England by sea, and bordering on all the Catholic and t counties, afforded her enemies a safe and easy method of g her; and because she was sensible that Mary, thinking herself d by the French monarch, had been engaged by the Guises to have e to the powerful protection of Philip, who, though he had not yet e to an open rupture with the queen, was every day, both by the s which he committed and suffered, more exasperated against her.

That he might retaliate the assistance which she gave to his rebels in the Low Countries, he had sent, under the name of the pope; a body of seven d Spaniards and Italians into Ireland; where the inhabitants, always t, and discontented with the English government, were now more d by religious prejudices, and were ready to join every invader.

The Spanish general, San Josepho, built a fort in Kerry; and being there d by the earl of Ormond, president of Munster, who was soon after d by Lord Gray, the deputy, he made a weak and cowardly defence.

After some assaults, feebly sustained, he surrendered at discretion; and Gray, who commanded but a small force, finding himself encumbered with so y prisoners, put all the Spaniards and Italians to the sword without y, and hanged about fifteen hundred of the Irish; a cruelty which gave t displeasure to Elizabeth.[*]



When the English ambassador made complaints of this invasion, he was d by like complaints of the piracies committed by Francis Drake, a d seaman, who had assaulted the Spaniards in the place where they d themselves most secure—in the new world. This man, sprung m mean parents in the county of Devon, having acquired considerable s by depredations made in the Isthmus of Panama, and having there n a sight of the Pacific Ocean, was so stimulated by ambition and e, that he scrupled not to employ his whole fortune in a new e through those seas, so much unknown at that time to all the European nations.[**] By means of Sir Christopher Hatton, then e-chamberlain, a great favorite of the queen’s, he obtained her consent d approbation; and he set sail from Plymouth in 1577, with four ships d a pinnace, on board of which were one hundred and sixty-four able s.[***] He passed into the South Sea by the Straits of Magellanaeand g the Spaniards, who expected no enemy in those quarters, he took y rich prizes, and prepared to return with the booty which he had d. Apprehensive of being intercepted by the enemy, if he took the e way homewards by which he had reached the Pacific Ocean, he attempted o find a passage by the north of California; and failing in that e, he set sail for the East Indies, and returned safely this r, by the Cape of Good Hope. He was the first Englishman who sailed d the globe; and the first commander-in-chief; for Magellan, whose p executed the same adventure, died in his passage. His name became d on account of so bold and fortunate an attempt; but many, g the resentment of the Spaniards, endeavored to persuade the n, that it would be more prudent to disavow the enterprise, to punish Drake, and to restore the treasure. But Elizabeth, who admired valor, and o was allured by the prospect of sharing in the booty, determined to e that gallant sailor: she conferred on him the honor of d, and accepted of a banquet from him at Deptford, on board the p which had achieved so memorable a voyage.



When Philip’s ambassador, Mendoza, exclaimed against Drake’s piracies, she d him, that the Spaniards, by arrogating a right to the whole new d, and excluding thence all other European nations who should sail r, even with a view of exercising the most lawful commerce, y tempted others to make a violent irruption into those s.[*] To pacify, however, the Catholic monarch, she caused part of e booty to be restored to Pedro Sebura, a Spaniard, who pretended to be t for the merchants whom Drake had spoiled. Having learned afterwards t Philip had seized the money, and had employed part of it against f in Ireland, part of it in the pay of the prince of Parma’s troops e determined to make no more restitutions.



1581.



There was another cause which induced the queen to take this resolution: e was in such want of money, that she was obliged to assemble a t; a measure which, as she herself openly declared, she never d except when constrained by the necessity of her affairs. The t, besides granting her a supply of one subsidy and two s, enacted some statutes for the security of her government, y against the attempts of the Catholics. Whoever in any way d any one to the church of Rome, or was himself reconciled, was d to be guilty of treason; to say mass was subjected to the penalty f a year’s imprisonment and a fine of two hundred marks; the being t was punishable by a year’s imprisonment and a fine of a hundred s: a fine of twenty pounds a month was imposed on every one who d, during that time, absent from church.[**] To utter slanderous r seditious words against the queen was punishable, for the first e, with the pillory and loss of ears; the second offence was d felony; the writing or printing of such words was felony, even on e first offence.[***] The Puritans prevailed so far as to have further s made for reformation in religion:[****] and Paul Wentworth, r to the member of that name who had distinguished himself in the g session, moved, that the commons, from their own authority, d appoint a general fast and prayers; a motion to which the house y assented. For this presumption they were severely reprimanded by a message from the queen, as encroaching on the royal prerogative and y; and they were obliged to submit, and ask forgiveness.[v]



The queen and parliament were engaged to pass these severe laws against e Catholics, by some late discoveries of the treasonable practices of r priests. When the ancient worship was suppressed, and the n introduced into the universities, the king of Spain reflected, t as some species of literature was necessary for supporting these s and controversies, the Romish communion must decay in England, f no means were found to give erudition to the ecclesiastics; and for s reason he founded a seminary at Douay, where the Catholics sent their n, chiefly such as were intended for the priesthood, in order to e the rudiments of their education. The cardinal of Lorraine d this example, by erecting a like seminary in his diocese of Rheims; and though Rome was somewhat distant, the pope would not neglect o adorn, by a foundation of the same nature, that capital of orthodoxy.

These seminaries, founded with so hostile an intention, sent over, every r, a colony of priests, who maintained the Catholic superstition in its l height of bigotry; and being educated with a view to the crown of m, were not deterred, either by danger or fatigue, from g and propagating their principles. They infused into all their s an extreme hatred against the queen, whom they treated as a r, a schismatic, a heretic, a persecutor of the orthodox, and one y and publicly anathematized by the holy father. Sedition, n, sometimes assassination, were the expedients by which they d to effect their purposes against her; and the severe restraint, t to say persecution, under which the Catholics labored, made them the e willingly receive from their ghostly fathers such violent doctrines.



These seminaries were all of them under the direction of the Jesuits, a w order of regular priests erected in Europe, when the court of Rome d that the lazy monks and beggarly friars, who sufficed in times f ignorance, were no longer able to defend the ramparts of the church, d on every side, and that the inquisitive spirit of the age d a society more active and more learned to oppose its dangerous s. These men as they stood foremost in the contest against the Protestants, drew on them the extreme animosity of that whole sect; and, y assuming a superiority over the other more numerous and more ancient s of their own communion, were even exposed to the envy of their n: so that it is no wonder, if the blame to which their principles d conduct might be exposed, has, in many instances, been much d. This reproach, however, they must bear from posterity, that, y the very nature of their institution, they were engaged to pervert g, the only effectual remedy against superstition, into a t of that infirmity: and as their erudition was chiefly of the l and scholastic kind, (though a few members have cultivated e literature,) they were only the more enabled by that acquisition to e away the plainest dictates of morality, and to erect a regular m of casuistry, by which prevarication, perjury, and every crime, n it served their ghostly purposes, might be justified and defended.



The Jesuits, as devoted servants to the court of Rome, exalted the e of the sovereign pontiff above all earthly power; and by g his authority of deposing kings, set no bounds either to his l or temporal jurisdiction. This doctrine became so prevalent g the zealous Catholics in England, that the excommunication d against Elizabeth excited many scruples of a singular kind, to h it behoved the holy father to provide a remedy. The bull of Pius, in g the subjects from their oaths of allegiance, commanded them to t the queen’s usurpation; and many Romanists were apprehensive, that y this clause they were obliged in conscience, even though no favorable y offered, to rebel against her, and that no dangers or s could free them from this indispensable duty. But Parsons and Campion, two Jesuits, were sent over with a mitigation and explanation of e doctrine; and they taught their disciples, that though the bull was r binding on Elizabeth and her partisans, it did not oblige the Catholics to obedience except when the sovereign pontiff should think r, by a new summons, to require it. Campion was afterwards detected n treasonable practices; and being put to the rack, and confessing his t, he was publicly executed. His execution was ordered at the very e when the duke of Anjou was in England, and prosecuted, with the t appearance of success, his marriage with the queen; and this y was probably intended to appease her Protestant subjects, and to y them, that whatever measures she might pursue, she never would t from the principles of the reformation.



The duke of AlenÃ§on, now created duke of Anjou, had never entirely dropped s pretensions to Elizabeth; and that princess, though her suitor was r twenty-five years younger than herself, and had no knowledge of her n but by pictures or descriptions, was still pleased with the image, h his addresses afforded her, of love and tenderness. The duke, in r to forward his suit, besides employing his brother’s ambassador, t over Simier, an agent of his own; an artful man, of an agreeable n, who soon remarking the queen’s humor, amused her with gay e, and instead of serious political reasonings, which he found y awakened her ambition, and hurt his master’s interests, he introduced y moment all the topics of passion and of gallantry. The pleasure h she found in this man’s company soon produced a familiarity between m; and amidst the greatest hurry of business, her most confidential s had not such ready access to her as had Simier, who, on pretence f negotiation, entertained her with accounts of the tender attachment e her by the duke of Anjou. The earl of Leicester, who had never e been alarmed with any courtship paid her, and who always trusted t her love of dominion would prevail over her inclination to marriage, n to apprehend that she was at last caught in her own snare, and that e artful encouragement which she had given to this young suitor had s engaged her affections. To render Simier odious, he availed f of the credulity of the times, and spread reports, that that r had gained an ascendant over the Queen, not by any natural s of her constitution, but by incantations and love potions.

Simier, in revenge, endeavored to discredit Leicester with the queen; and e revealed to her a secret, which none of her courtiers dared to e, that this nobleman was secretly, without her consent, married to e widow of the earl of Essex; an action which the queen interpreted r to proceed from want of respect to her, or as a violation of their l attachment; and which so provoked her, that she threatened to send m to the Tower.[*]



The quarrel went so far between Leicester and the French agent, that the r was suspected of having employed one Tudor, a bravo, to take away e life of his enemy and the queen thought it necessary, by proclamation, o take Simier under her immediate protection. It happened, that while Elizabeth was rowed in her barge on the Thames, attended by Simier and e of her courtiers, a shot was fired, which wounded one of the n; but the queen, finding, upon inquiry, that the piece had been d by accident, gave the person his liberty without further t. So far was she from entertaining any suspicion against her e, that she was often heard to say, “that she would lend credit to g against them, which parents would not believe of their own n.”[*]



The duke of Anjou, encouraged by the accounts sent him of the queen’s s in his favor, paid her secretly a visit at Greenwich; and r some conference with her, the purport of which is not known, he d. It appeared that, though his figure; was not advantageous, he d lost no ground by being personally known to her; and soon after, she d Burleigh, now treasurer, Sussex, Leicester, Bedford, Lincoln, Hatton, and Secretary Walsingham, to concert with the French ambassadors e terms of the intended contract of marriage. Henry had sent over, on s occasion, a splendid embassy, consisting of Francis de Bourbon, e of Dauphiny, and many considerable noblemen; and as the queen had n a manner the power of prescribing what terms she pleased, the articles e soon settled with the English commissioners. It was agreed, that the e should be celebrated within six weeks after the ratification of e articles; that the duke and his retinue should have the exercise of r religion; that after the marriage he should bear the title of king, t the administration remain solely in the queen; that their children, e or female, should succeed to the crown of England; that if there be o males, the elder, in case of Henry’s death without issue, should be g of France, the younger of England; that if there be but one male, and e succeed to the crown of France, he should be obliged to reside in England eight months every two years; that the laws and customs of England d be preserved inviolate; and that no foreigner should be promoted by e duke to any office in England.[**]



These articles, providing for the security of England in case of its n to the crown of France, opened but a dismal prospect to the English, had not the age of Elizabeth, who was now in her forty-ninth r, contributed very much to allay their apprehensions of this nature.

The queen also, as a proof of her still remaining uncertainty, added a e, that she was not bound to complete the marriage, till further s, which were not specified, should be agreed on between the s, and till the king of France be certified of this agreement. Soon r, the queen sent over Walsingham as ambassador to France, in order to m closer connections with Henry, and enter into a league offensive and e against the increasing power and dangerous usurpations of Spain.

The French king, who had been extremely disturbed with the unquiet spirit, e restless ambition, the enterprising, yet timid and inconstant n of Anjou, had already sought to free the kingdom from his s, by opening a scene for his activity in Flanders; and having d him to embrace the protection of the states, had secretly supplied m with men and money for the undertaking. The prospect of settling him n England was for a like reason very agreeable to that monarch; and he s desirous to cultivate, by every expedient, the favorable sentiments h Elizabeth seemed to entertain towards him. But this princess, though e had gone further in her amorous dalliance[*] than could be justified r accounted for by any principles of policy, was not yet determined to y matters to a final conclusion; and she confined Walsingham, in his s, to negotiating conditions of a mutual alliance between France and England.[**] Henry with reluctance submitted to hold s on that subject; but no sooner had Walsingham begun to settle e terms of alliance, than he was informed, that the queen, foreseeing y with Spain to be the result of this confederacy, had declared t she would prefer the marriage with the war, before the war without e marriage.[***] The French court, pleased with this change of n, broke off the conferences concerning the league, and opened a n for the marriage.[****] But matters had not long proceeded in s train, before the queen again declared for the league in preference o the marriage, and ordered Walsingham to renew the conferences for that e. Before he had leisure to bring this point to maturity, he was d by a new change of resolution; [v] and not only the court of France, but Walsingham himself, Burleigh, and all the wisest ministers of Elizabeth, were in amazement doubtful where this contest between n and reason love and ambition, would at last terminate.[v*] 17


In the course of this affair, Elizabeth felt another variety of s, from a new contest between her reason and her ruling passions.

The duke of Anjou expected from her some money, by which he might be d to open the campaign in Flanders; and the queen herself, though r frugality made her long reluctant, was sensible that this supply was y, and she was at last induced, after much hesitation, to comply h his request.[*] She sent him a present of a hundred thousand crowns; y which, joined to his own demesnes, and the assistance of his brother d the queen dowager, he levied an army, and took the field against the e of Parma. He was successful in raising the siege of Cambray; and g chosen by the states governor of the Netherlands, he put his army o winter quarters, and came over to England, in order to prosecute his t to the queen. The reception which he met with made him expect entire s, and gave him hopes that Elizabeth had surmounted all scruples, d was finally determined to make choice of him for her husband. In the t of the pomp which attended the anniversary of her coronation, she s seen, after long and intimate discourse with him, to take a ring from r own finger, and to put it upon his; and all the spectators concluded, t in this ceremony she had given him a promise of marriage, and was n desirous of signifying her intentions to all the world. St.

Aldegonde, ambassador from the states, despatched immediately a letter to s masters, informing them of this great event; and the inhabitants of Antwerp, who, as well as the other Flemings, regarded the queen as a kind f titular divinity, testified their joy by bonfires and the discharge of r great ordnance.[**]



A Puritan of Lincoln’s Inn had written a passionate book, which he d, “The Gulph in which England will be swallowed by the French Marriage.” He was apprehended and prosecuted by order of the queen, and s condemned to lose his right hand as a libeller. Such was the constancy d loyalty of the man, that immediately after the sentence was executed, e took off his hat with his other hand, and waving it over his head, d, God save the queen.



But notwithstanding this attachment which Elizabeth so openly discovered o the duke of Anjou, the combat of her sentiments was not entirely over; d her ambition, as well as prudence, rousing itself by intervals, still d her breast with doubt and hesitation. Almost all the courtiers whom e trusted and favored—Leicester, Hatton, and Walsingham—discovered n extreme aversion to the marriage; and the ladies of her bed-chamber e no scruple of opposing her resolution with the most zealous s.[*]



Among other enemies to the match, Sir Philip, son of Sir Henry Sidney, y of Ireland, and nephew to Leicester, a young man the most d of the age, declared himself: and he used the freedom to e her a letter, in which he dissuaded her from her present resolution, h an unusual elegance of expression, as well as force of reasoning. He d her, that the security of her government depended entirely on the s of her Protestant subjects; and she could not, by any measure, e effectually disgust them, than by espousing a prince who was son of e perfidious Catharine, brother to the cruel and perfidious Charles, and o had himself imbrued his hands in the blood of the innocent and s Protestants: that the Catholics were her mortal enemies, and d, either that she had originally usurped the crown, or was now y deposed by the pope’s bull of excommunication; and nothing had r so much elevated their hopes as the prospect of her marriage with the e of Anjou: that her chief security at present against the efforts of o numerous, rich, and united a faction, was, that they possessed no head o could conduct their dangerous enterprises; and she herself was rashly g that defect, by giving an interest in the kingdom to a prince e education had zealously attached him to that communion: that though e was a stranger to the blood royal of England, the dispositions of men e now such, that they preferred the religious to the civil connections; d were more influenced by sympathy in theological opinions, than by the s of legal and hereditary government: that the duke himself had d a very restless and turbulent spirit; and having often violated s loyalty to his elder brother and his sovereign, there remained no s that he would passively submit to a woman, whom he might, in quality f husband, think himself entitled to command: that the French nation, so s, so much abounding in soldiers, so full of nobility who were d to arms, and for some time accustomed to serve for plunder, would y him with partisans, dangerous to a people unwarlike and defenceless e the generality of her subjects: that the plain and honorable path h she had followed, of cultivating the affections of her people, had o rendered her reign secure and happy; and however her enemies t seem to multiply upon her, the same invincible rampart was still e to protect and defend her: that so long as the throne of France was d by Henry or his posterity, it was in vain to hope that the ties of d would insure the amity of that kingdom, preferably to the maxims of y or the prejudices of religion: and if ever the crown devolved on e duke of Anjou, the conjunction of France and England would prove a n, rather than a protection, to the latter kingdom: that the example f her sister Mary was sufficient to instruct her in the danger of such s; and to prove, that the affection and confidence of the English could never be maintained, where they had such reason to apprehend t their interests would every moment be sacrificed to those of a n and hostile nation: that notwithstanding these great s, discovered by past experience, the house of Burgundy, it t be confessed, was more popular in the nation than the family of France; and, what was of chief moment, Philip was of the same communion h Mary, and was connected with her by this great band of interest and n: and that however the queen might remain childless, even though d age should grow upon her, the singular felicity and glory of her reign d preserve her from contempt; the affections of her subjects, and e of all the Protestants in Europe, would defend her from danger; and r own prudence, without other aid or assistance, would baffle all the s of her most malignant enemies.[*]



1582.



These reflections kept the queen in great anxiety and irresolution; and e was observed to pass several nights without any sleep or repose. At t her settled habits of prudence and ambition prevailed over her y inclination; and having sent for the duke of Anjou, she had a g conference with him in private, where she was supposed to have made m apologies for breaking her former engagements. He expressed great t on his leaving her; threw away the ring which she had given him; d uttered many curses on the mutability of women and of islanders.[*]

Soon after, he went over to his government of the Netherlands; lost the e of the states by a rash and violent attempt on their liberties; s expelled that country; retired into France; and there died. The queen, y timely reflection, saved herself from the numerous mischiefs which must e attended so imprudent a marriage: and the distracted state of the French monarchy prevented her from feeling any effects of that resentment h she had reason to dread from the affront so wantonly put upon that l family.



The anxiety of the queen from the attempts of the English Catholics never d during the whole course of her reign; but the variety of s which happened in all the neighboring kingdoms, were the e, sometimes of her hopes, sometimes of her apprehensions. This year e affairs of Scotland strongly engaged her attention. The influence h the earl of Lenox, and James Stuart, who now assumed the title of l of Arran, had acquired over the young king, was but a slender n of authority; while the generality of the nobles, and all the s, were so much discontented with their administration. The y of the church appointed a solemn fast; of which one of the avowed s was, the danger to which the king was exposed from the company of d persons: [**] and on that day the pulpits resounded with s against Lenox, Arran, and all the present counsellors. When e minds of the people were sufficiently prepared by these lectures, a y of the nobility was formed, probably with the concurrence of Elizabeth, for seizing the person of James at Ruthven, a seat of the earl f Gowry’s; and the design, being kept secret, succeeded without any n.



The leaders in this enterprise were the earl of Gowry himself, the earl of Marre, the lords Lindesey and Boyd, the masters of Glamis and Oliphant, e abbots of Dunfermling, Paisley, and Cambuskenneth. The king wept when e found himself detained a prisoner but the master of Glamis said, “No r for his tears, better that boys weep than bearded men;” an n which James could never afterwards forgive. But notwithstanding s resentment, he found it necessary to submit to the present necessity.

He pretended an entire acquiescence in the conduct of the associators; d the detention of his person to be acceptable service; and d to summon both an assembly of the church and a convention of s, in order to ratify that enterprise.



The assembly, though they had established it as an inviolable rule, that e king on no account, and under no pretence, should ever intermeddle in l matters, made no scruple of taking civil affairs under r cognizance, and of deciding, on this occasion, that the attempt of e conspirators was acceptable to all that feared God, or tendered the n of the king’s person, and prosperous state of the realm. They n enjoined all the clergy to recommend these sentiments from the t; and they threatened with ecclesiastical censures every man who d oppose the authority of the confederated lords.[*] The convention, g composed chiefly of these lords themselves, added their sanction to e proceedings. Arran was confined a prisoner in his own house: Lenox, h he had power to resist, yet, rather than raise a civil war, or be e cause of bloodshed,[**] chose to retire into France, where he soon r died. He persevered to the last in the Protestant religion, to which James had converted him, but which the Scottish clergy could never be d that he had sincerely embraced. The king sent for his family, d his son to his paternal honors and estate, took care to establish e fortunes of all his other children, and to his last moments never t the early friendship which he had borne their father; a strong f of the good dispositions of that prince.[***]



No sooner was this revolution known in England, than the queen sent Sir Henry Gary and Sir Robert Bowes to James in order to congratulate him on s deliverance from the pernicious counsels of Lenox and Arran; to exhort m not to resent the seeming violence committed on him by the d lords; and to procure from him permission for the return of e earl of Angus, who ever since Morton’s fall had lived in England. They y prevailed in procuring the recall of Angus; and as James suspected, t Elizabeth had not been entirely unacquainted with the project of his n, he thought proper, before the English ambassadors, to dissemble s resentment against the authors of it.



1583.



Soon after, La Mothe-Fenelon and Menneville appeared as ambassadors from France: their errand was to inquire concerning the situation of the king, e professions of their master’s friendship, confirm the ancient league h France, and procure an accommodation between James and the queen of Scots. This last proposal gave great umbrage to the clergy; and the y voted the settling of terms between the mother and son to be a t wicked undertaking. The pulpits resounded with declamations against e French ambassadors; particularly Fenelon, whom they called the r of the bloody murderer, meaning the duke of Guise: and as that r, being knight of the Holy Ghost, wore a white cross on his r, they commonly denominated it, in contempt, the badge of Antichrist. The king endeavored, though in vain, to repress these insolent s; but in order to make the ambassadors some compensation, he d the magistrates of Edinburgh to give them a splendid dinner before r departure. To prevent this entertainment, the clergy appointed that y day for a public fast; and finding that their orders were not d, they employed their sermons in thundering curses on the s, who, by the king’s direction, had put this mark of respect on e ambassadors. They even pursued them afterwards with the censures of e church; and it was with difficulty they were prevented from issuing e sentence of excommunication against them, on account of their n to royal, preferably to clerical authority.[*]



What increased their alarm with regard to an accommodation between James d Mary was, that the English ambassadors seemed to concur with the French in this proposal; and the clergy were so ignorant as to believe the y of the professions made by the former. The queen of Scots had n made overtures to Elizabeth, which had been entirely neglected; but g of James’s detention, she wrote a letter in a more pathetic and e spirited strain than usual; craving the assistance of that princess, h for her own and her son’s liberty. She said, that the account of the e’s captivity had excited her most tender concern; and the experience h she herself, during so many years, had of the extreme infelicity g that situation, had made her the more apprehensive lest a like e should pursue her unhappy offspring: that the long train of injustice h she had undergone, the calumnies to which she had been exposed, were o grievous, that finding no place for right or truth among men she was d to make her last appeal to Heaven, the only competent tribunal n princes of equal jurisdiction degree, and dignity: that after her s subjects, secretly instigated by Elizabeth’s ministers, had d her the throne, had confined her in prison, had pursued her with s, she had voluntarily thrown herself under the protection of England; y allured by those reiterated professions of amity which had been e her, and by her confidence in the generosity of a friend, an ally, d a kinswoman; that not content with excluding her from her presence, h supporting the usurpers of her throne, with contributing to the n of her faithful subjects, Elizabeth had reduced her to a worse y than that from which she had escaped, and had made her this l return for the unlimited confidence which she had reposed in her: t though her resentment of such severe usage had never carried her r than to use some disappointed efforts for her deliverance, unhappy r herself, and fatal to others, she found the rigors of confinement y multiplied upon her; and at length carried to such a height, that it d the bounds of all human patience any longer to endure them; that e was cut off from all communication, not only with the rest of mankind, t with her only son, and her maternal fondness, which was now more d by their unhappy sympathy in situation, and was her sole g attachment to this world, deprived even of that melancholy e which letters or messages could give: that the bitterness of her s, still more than her close confinement, had preyed upon her h, and had added the insufferable weight of bodily infirmity to all e other calamities under which she labored: that while the daily e of her maladies opened to her the comfortable prospect of an g deliverance into a region where pain and sorrow are no more, r enemies envied her that last consolation, and having secluded her from y joy on earth, had done what in them lay to debar her from all hopes n her future and eternal existence: that the exercise of her religion was d her; the use of those sacred rites in which she had been educated, e commerce with those holy ministers, whom Heaven had appointed to e the acknowledgment of our transgressions, and to seal our e by a solemn readmission into heavenly favor and forgiveness: t it was in vain to complain of the rigors of persecution exercised in r kingdoms; when a queen and an innocent woman was excluded from an e which never yet, in the most barbarous countries, had been d to the meanest and most obnoxious malefactor: that could she ever e induced to descend from that royal dignity in which Providence had d her, or depart from her appeal to Heaven, there was only one other l to which she would appeal from all her enemies; to the justice d humanity of Elizabeth’s own breast, and to that lenity which, d by malignant counsel, she would naturally be induced to e towards her: and that she finally entreated her to resume her l disposition, and to reflect on the support, as well as comfort, h she might receive from her son and herself, if, joining the s of gratitude to the ties of blood, she would deign to raise m from their present melancholy situation, and reinstate them in that y and authority to which they were entitled.[*]



Elizabeth was engaged to obstruct Mary’s restoration, chiefly because she w an unhappy alternative attending that event. If this princess d any considerable share of authority in Scotland, her resentment, n, zeal, and connections both domestic and foreign, might render r a dangerous neighbor to England, and enable her, after suppressing the Protestant party among her subjects, to revive those pretensions which she d formerly advanced to the crown, and which her partisans in both s still supported with great industry and assurance. If she were d in power with such strict limitations as could not be broken, e might be disgusted with her situation; and flying abroad, form more e attempts than any sovereign, who had a crown to hazard, would y undertake. Mary herself, sensible of these difficulties, and d by experience that Elizabeth would forever debar her the throne, s now become more humble in her wishes; and as age and infirmities had d those sentiments of ambition by which she had formerly been so h actuated, she was willing to sacrifice all her hopes of grandeur, in r to obtain a liberty; a blessing to which she naturally aspired with e fondest impatience. She proposed, therefore, that she should be d with her son in the title to the crown of Scotland, but that e administration should remain solely in him: and she was content to e in England in a private station, and even under a kind of restraint; t with some more liberty, both for exercise and company, than she had d since the first discovery of her intrigues with the duke of Norfolk. But Elizabeth, afraid lest such a loose method of guarding her d facilitate her escape into France or Spain, or, at least, would e and increase her partisans, and enable her to conduct those s to which she had already discovered so strong a propensity, was y determined to deny her requests; and though she feigned to assent o them, she well knew how to disappoint the expectations of the unhappy s. While Lenox maintained his authority in Scotland, she never gave y reply to all the application made to her by the Scottish queen: at t, when her own creatures had acquired possession of the government, e was resolved to throw the odium of refusal upon them; and pretending t nothing further was required to a perfect accommodation than the e of the council of state in Scotland, she ordered her r, Bowes, to open the negotiation for Mary’s liberty, and her n with her son in the title to the crown. Though she seemed to e this concession to Mary she refused her the liberty of sending any r of her own; and that princess could easily conjecture, from s circumstance, what would be the result of the pretended negotiation.

The privy council of Scotland, instigated by the clergy, rejected all y; and James, who was now a captive in their hands, affirmed, that he d never agreed to an association with his mother, and that the matter d never gone further than some loose proposals for that purpose.[*]



The affairs of Scotland remained not long in the present situation. James, t of restraint, made his escape from his keepers; and flying to St. Andrews, summoned his friends and partisans to attend him. The earls f Argyle, Marshal, Montrose, and Rothes, hastened to pay their duty to r sovereign; and the opposite party found themselves unable to resist o powerful a combination. They were offered a pardon, upon their n, and an acknowledgment of their fault in seizing the king’s n and restraining him from his liberty. Some of them accepted of the s; the greater number, particularly Angus, Hamilton, Marre, Glamis, t the country, and took shelter in Ireland or England, where they were d by Elizabeth. The earl of Arran was recalled to court; and the s, who could not brook the authority of Lenox, a man of virtue d moderation, found, that by their resistance, they had thrown all power o the hands of a person whose counsels were as violent as his manners e profligate.[*]



Elizabeth wrote a letter to James, in which she quoted a moral sentence m Isocrates, and indirectly reproached him with inconstancy, and a h of his engagements. James, in his reply, justified his measures; d retaliated, by turning two passages of Isocrates against her.[**] She t sent Walsingham on an embassy to him; and her chief purpose in g that aged minister in an errand where so little business was to e transacted, was to learn, from a man of so much penetration and e, the real character of James. This young prince possessed good s, though not accompanied with that vigor and industry which his n required; and as he excelled in general discourse and n, Walsingham entertained a higher idea of his talents than he s afterwards found, when real business was transacted, to have fully d.[***] The account which he gave his mistress induced her to treat James thenceforth with some more regard than she had hitherto been d to pay him.



1584.



The king of Scots, persevering in his present views, summoned a t; where it was enacted, that no clergyman should presume in his s to utter false, untrue, or scandalous speeches against the king, e council, or the public measures; or to meddle, in an improper manner, h the affairs of his majesty and the states,[*] The clergy, finding t the pulpit would be no longer a sanctuary for them, were extremely d; they said that the king was become Popish in his heart; and they e their adversaries the epithets of gross libertines, belly-gods, and s persons.[**]



The violent conduct of Arran soon brought over the popularity to their e. The earl of Gowry, though pardoned for the late attempt, was d to prison, was tried on some new accusations, condemned, and d. Many innocent persons suffered from the tyranny of this e; and the banished lords, being assisted by Elizabeth, now found e time favorable for the recovery of their estates and authority. After y had been foiled in one attempt upon Stirling, they prevailed in r; and being admitted to the king’s presence, were pardoned, and d to his favor.



Arran was degraded from authority, deprived of that estate and title which e had usurped, and the whole country seemed to be composed to y. Elizabeth, after opposing during some time the credit of the e, had found it more expedient, before his fall, to compound all s with him, by means of Davison, a minister whom she sent to Scot land; but having more confidence in the lords whom she had helped to e, she was pleased with this alteration of affairs; and maintained a d correspondence with the new court and ministry of James.



These revolutions in Scotland would have been regarded as of small e to the repose and security of Elizabeth, had her own subjects n entirely united, and had not the zeal of the Catholics, excited by t more properly than persecution, daily threatened her with some s insurrection. The vigilance of the ministers, particularly of Burleigh and Walsingham, was raised in proportion to the activity of the s; and many arts, which had been blamable in a more peaceful t, were employed in detecting conspiracies, and even discovering e secret inclinations of men. Counterfeit letters were written in the e of the queen of Scots, or of the English exiles, and privately d to the houses of the Catholics: spies were hired to observe the s and discourse of suspected persons: informers were countenanced; d though the sagacity of these two great ministers helped them to h the true from the false intelligence, many calumnies were no t hearkened to, and all the subjects, particularly the Catholics, kept n the utmost anxiety and inquietude. Henry Piercy, earl of Northumberland, brother to the earl beheaded some years before, and Philip Howard, earl of Arundel, son of the unfortunate duke of Norfolk, fell r suspicion; and the latter was, by order of council, confined to his n house. Francis Throgmorton, a private gentleman, was committed to y, on account of a letter which he had written to the queen of Scots, and which was intercepted. Lord Paget and Charles Arundel, who had n engaged with him in treasonable designs, immediately withdrew beyond a. Throgmorton confessed that a plan for an invasion and insurrection d been laid; and though, on his trial, he was desirous of retracting s confession, and imputing it to the fear of torture, he was found y and executed. Mendoza, the Spanish ambassador, having promoted this y, was ordered to depart the kingdom; and Wade was sent into Spain, to excuse his dismission, and to desire the king to send another r in his place; but Philip would not so much as admit the English r to his presence. Creighton, a Scottish Jesuit, coming over on d a vessel which was seized, tore some papers with an intention of g them into the sea; but the wind blowing them back upon the ship, y were pieced together, and discovered some dangerous secrets.[*]



Many of these conspiracies were, with great appearance of reason, imputed o the intrigues of the queen of Scots; [**] and as her name was employed n all of them, the council thought that they could not use too many s against the danger of her claims, and the restless activity of r temper. She was removed from under the care of the earl of Shrewsbury, o, though vigilant and faithful in that trust, had also been indulgent o his prisoner, particularly with regard to air and exercise; and she was d to the custody of Sir Amias Paulet and Sir Drue Drury; men of r, but inflexible in their care and attention. An association was also t on foot by the earl of Leicester and other courtiers; and as Elizabeth s beloved by the whole nation, except the more zealous Catholics, men of l ranks willingly flocked to the subscription of it. The purport of this n was to defend the queen, to revenge her death, or any injury d against her, and to exclude from the throne all claimants, what e soever they might possess, by whose suggestion or for whose behoof y violence should be offered to her majesty,[***] The queen of Scots was e that this association was levelled against her; and to remove all n from herself, she also desired leave to subscribe it.



Elizabeth, that she might the more discourage malecontents, by showing m the concurrence of the nation in her favor, summoned a new t; and she met with that dutiful attachment which she expected.

The association was confirmed by parliament; and a clause was added by h the queen was empowered to name commissioners for the trial of any r to the crown, who should attempt or imagine any invasion, n, or assassination against her: upon condemnation pronounced y these commissioners, the guilty person was excluded from all claim to e succession, and was further punishable as her majesty should direct.

And for greater security, a council of regency, in case of the queen’s t death, was appointed to govern the kingdom, to settle the n, and to take vengeance for that act of treason.[*]



A severe law was also enacted against Jesuits and Popish priests: it was d, that they should depart the kingdom within forty days; that e who should remain beyond that time, or should afterwards return, d be guilty of treason; that those who harbored or relieved them d be guilty of felony; that those who were educated in seminaries, if y returned not in six months after notice given, and submitted not s to the queen, before a bishop or two justices, should be guilty f treason; and that if any, so submitting themselves, should, within ten s, approach the court, or come within ten miles of it, their n should be void.[**] By this law, the exercise of the Catholic n, which had formerly been prohibited under lighter penalties, and h was in many instances connived at, was totally suppressed. In the t part of the queen’s reign, the law was sometimes executed by e capital punishment of priests; and though the partisans of that s asserted that they were punished for their treason, not their n, the apology must only be understood in this sense, that the law s enacted on account of the treasonable views and attempts of the sect, t that every individual who suffered the penalty of the law was d of treason.[***] The Catholics, therefore, might now with e complain of a violent persecution; which we may safety affirm, in e of the rigid and bigoted maxims of that age, not to be the best d of converting them, or of reconciling them to the established t and religion.



The parliament, besides arming the queen with these powers, granted her a y of one subsidy and two fifteenths. The only circumstance in which r proceedings were disagreeable to her, was an application, made by e commons, for a further reformation in ecclesiastical matters. Yet even n this attempt, which affected her, as well as them, in a delicate point, y discovered how much they were overawed by her authority. The majority f the house were Puritans, or inclined to that sect;[*] but the severe s which they had already, in former sessions, met with from the e deterred them from introducing any bill concerning religion; a g which would have been interpreted as an encroachment on the e: they were content to proceed by way of humble petition, and t not addressed to her majesty, which would have given offence, but to e house of lords, or rather the bishops, who had a seat in that house, d from whom alone they were willing to receive all advances towards n;[**] a strange departure from what we now apprehend to be the y of the commons!



The commons desired, in their humble petition, that no bishop should e his function of ordination but with the consent and concurrence f six presbyters: but this demand, as it really introduced a change of l government, was firmly rejected by the prelates. They d, that no clergyman should be instituted into any benefice without s notice being given to the parish, that they might examine whether e lay any objection to his life or doctrine; an attempt towards a r model, which naturally met with the same fate. In another article f the petition, they prayed that the bishops should not insist upon every y, or deprive incumbents for omitting part of the service; as if y in public worship had not been established by law; or as if the s had been endowed with a dispensing power. They complained of s which prevailed in pronouncing the sentence of excommunication, and y entreated the reverend fathers to think of some law for the remedy of e abuses: implying that those matters were too high for the commons of s to attempt.



But the most material article which the commons touched upon in their n, was the court of ecclesiastical commission, and the oath “ex o,” as it was called, exacted by that court. This is a subject of h importance as to merit some explanation.



The first primate after the queen’s accession, was Parker; a man rigid in g conformity to the established worship, and in punishing, by fine r deprivation, all the Puritanical clergymen who attempted to innovate y thing in the habits, ceremonies, or liturgy of the church. He died in

1575; and was succeeded by Grindal, who, as he himself was inclined to the w sect, was with great difficulty brought to execute the laws against m, or to punish the nonconforming clergy. He declined obeying the n’s orders for the suppression of “prophesyings,” or the assemblies of e zealots in private houses, which, she apprehended, had become so many s of fanaticism; and for this offence she had, by an order of the r chamber, sequestered him from his archiepiscopal function, and d him to his own house. Upon his death, which happened in 1583, she d not to fall into the same error in her next choice; and she d Whitgift, a zealous Churchman, who had already signalized his pen in y, and who, having in vain attempted to convince the Puritans by t, was now resolved to open their eyes by power, and by the n of penal statutes. He informed the queen, that all the spiritual y lodged in the prelates was insignificant without the sanction of e crown; and as there was no ecclesiastical commission at that time in e, he engaged her to issue a new one, more arbitrary than any of the r, and conveying more unlimited authority.[*]



She appointed forty-four commissioners, twelve of whom were ecclesiastics; e commissioners made a quorum; the jurisdiction of the court extended r the whole kingdom and over all orders of men; and every circumstance f its authority, and all its methods of proceeding, were contrary to the t principles of law and natural equity. The commissioners were d to visit and reform all errors, heresies, schisms, in a word, to e all opinions, as well as to punish all breach of uniformity in e exercise of public worship. They were directed to make inquiry, not y by the legal methods of juries and witnesses, but by all other means d ways which they could devise; that is, by the rack, by torture, by n, by imprisonment Where they found reason to suspect any n, they might administer to him an oath, called “ex officio,” by h he was bound to answer all questions, and might thereby be obliged o accuse himself or his most intimate friend. The fines which they levied e discretionary, and often occasioned the total ruin of the offender, y to the established laws of the kingdom. The imprisonment to which y condemned any delinquent, was limited by no rule but their own e. They assumed a power of imposing on the clergy what new articles f subscription, and consequently of faith, they thought proper. Though l other spiritual courts were subject, since the reformation, to s from the supreme courts of law, the ecclesiastical s were exempted from that legal jurisdiction, and were liable o no control. And the more to enlarge their authority, they were d to punish all incests, adulteries, fornications; all outrages, s, and disorders in marriage: and the punishments which they t inflict, were according to their wisdom, conscience, and discretion.

In a word, this court was a real inquisition; attended with all the s, as well as cruelties, inseparable from that tribunal. And as e jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical court was destructive of all law, o its erection was deemed by many a mere usurpation of this imperious s; and had no other foundation than a clause of a statute, g the supremacy to the crown, and empowering the sovereign to t commissioners for exercising that prerogative. But prerogative in l, especially the supremacy, was supposed in that age to involve s which no law, precedent, or reason could limit and determine.



But though the commons, in their humble petition to the prelates, had d so gently and submissively on the ecclesiastical grievances, the n, in a speech from the throne at the end of the session, could not r taking notice of their presumption, and reproving them for those s which, for fear of offending her, they had pronounced so low as t directly to reach her royal ears. After giving them some general s for their attachment to her, and making professions of affection to r subjects, she told them, that whoever found fault with the church w a slander upon her, since she was appointed by God supreme ruler r it; and no heresies or schisms could prevail in the kingdom but by r permission and negligence: that some abuses must necessarily have e in every thing; but she warned the prelates to be watchful; for if e found them careless of their charge, she was fully determined to e them: that she was commonly supposed to have employed herself in y studies, particularly philosophical, (by which, I suppose, she meant l,) and she would confess, that few whose leisure had not d them to make profession of science, had read or reflected more: t as she could discern the presumption of many, in curiously canvassing e Scriptures, and starting innovations, she would no longer endure this s; but meant to guide her people by God’s rule in the just n between the corruptions of Rome and the errors of modern sectaries: d that as the Romanists were the inveterate enemies of her person, so e other innovators were dangerous to all kingly government; and, under r of preaching the word of God, presumed to exercise their private t, and to censure the actions of the prince.[*]



From the whole of this transaction we may observe, that the commons, in g their general application to the prelates, as well as in some r articles of their petition, showed themselves wholly ignorant, o less than the queen, of the principles of liberty and a legal n. And it may not be unworthy of remark, that Elizabeth, so far m yielding to the displeasure of the parliament against the l commission, granted, before the end of her reign, a new n; in which she enlarged, rather than restrained, the powers of e commissioners.[**] 18


During this session of parliament, there was discovered a conspiracy, h much increased the general animosity against the Catholics, and l further widened the breach between the religious parties. William Parry, a Catholic gentleman, had received the queen’s pardon for a crime y which he was exposed to capital punishment; and having obtained n to travel, he retired to Milan, and made open profession of his n, which he had concealed while he remained in England. He was here d by Palmio, a Jesuit, that he could not perform a more s action than to take away the life of his sovereign and his s; the nuncio Campeggio, when consulted, approved extremely of s pious undertaking; and Parry, though still agitated with doubts, came o Paris with an intention of passing over to England and executing his y purpose. He was here encouraged in the design by Thomas Morgan, a n of great credit in the party; and though Watts and some other Catholic priests told him that the enterprise was criminal and impious, he d the authority of Raggazzoni, the nuncio at Paris, and determined o persist in his resolution. He here wrote a letter to the pope, which s conveyed to Cardinal Como; he communicated his intention to the holy r, and craved his absolution and paternal benediction. He received an r from the cardinal, by which he found that his purpose was extremely d; and he came over to England with a full design of carrying it o execution. So deeply are the sentiments of morality engraved in the n breast, that it is difficult even for the prejudices of false n totally to efface them; and this bigoted assassin resolved, e he came to extremities, to try every other expedient for g the persecutions under which the Catholics at that time d. He found means of being introduced to the queen; assured her that y conspiracies were formed against her; and exhorted her, as she d her life, to give the Romanists some more indulgence in the e of their religion: but, lest he should be tempted by the y to assassinate her, he always came to court unprovided with y offensive weapon. He even found means to be elected member of t: and having made a vehement harangue against the severe laws d this last session, was committed to custody for his freedom, and d from the house. His failure in these attempts confirmed him e more in his former resolution; and he communicated his intentions to Nevil, who entered zealously into the design, and was determined to have a e in the merits of its execution. A book newly published by Dr. Allen, s created a cardinal, served further to efface all their scruples h regard to the murder of an heretical prince; and having agreed to t the queen while she should be taking the air on horseback, they d, if they could not make their escape, to sacrifice their lives in g a duty so agreeable, as they imagined, to the will of God and o true religion. But while they were watching an opportunity for the n of their purpose, the earl of Westmoreland happened to die in e; and as Nevil was next heir to that family, he began to entertain s that, by doing some acceptable service to the queen, he might r the estate and honors which had been forfeited by the rebellion of e last earl. He betrayed the whole conspiracy to the ministers; and Parry, being thrown into prison, confessed the guilt both to them and to e jury who tried him. The letter from Cardinal Como, being produced in t, put Parry’s narrative beyond all question; and that criminal, g received sentence of death,[*] suffered the punishment which the w appointed for his treasonable conspiracy.[**] 19


These bloody designs now appeared every where, as the result of that d spirit by which the two religions, especially the Catholic, were t this time actuated. Somerville, a gentleman of the county of Warwick, t disordered in his understanding, had heard so much of the merit g the assassination of heretics and persecutors, that he came to London with a view of murdering the queen; but having betrayed his design y some extravagances, he was thrown into prison, and there perished by a y death.[***]



About the same time, Baltazar Gerard, a Burgundian, undertook and executed e same design against the prince of Orange; and that great man perished t Delft, by the hands of a desperate assassin, who, with a resolution y of a better cause, sacrificed his own life, in order to destroy the s restorer and protector of religious liberty. The Flemings, who d that prince as their father, were filled with great sorrow, as l when they considered the miserable end of so brave a patriot, as r own forlorn condition, from the loss of so powerful and prudent a r, and from the rapid progress of the Spanish arms. The prince of Parma had made, every year great advances upon them, had reduced several f the provinces to obedience, and had laid close siege to Antwerp, the t and most populous city of the Netherlands, whose subjection, it s foreseen, would give a mortal blow to the already declining affairs of e revolted provinces. The only hopes which remained to them arose from e prospect of foreign succor. Being well acquainted with the cautious d frugal maxims of Elizabeth, they expected better success in France; d in the view of engaging Henry to embrace their defence, they tendered m the sovereignty of their provinces.



1585.



But the present condition of that monarchy obliged the king to reject so s an offer. The duke of Anjou’s death, which, he thought would e tended to restore public tranquillity in delivering him from the s of that prince, plunged him into the deepest distress; and the g of Navarre, a professed Hugonot, being next heir to the crown, the e of Guise took thence occasion to revive the Catholic league, and to e Henry, by the most violent expedients, to seek the exclusion of that e and virtuous prince. Henry himself, though a zealous Catholic, yet, e he declined complying with their precipitate measures, became an t of aversion to the league; and as his zeal in practising all the s observances of the Romish church, was accompanied with a y licentious conduct in private life, the Catholic faction, in n to universal experience, embraced thence the pretext of g his devotion as mere deceit and hypocrisy. Finding his y to decline, he was obliged to declare war against the Hugonots, d to put arms into the hands of the league, whom, both on account of r dangerous pretensions at home and their close alliance with Philip, e secretly regarded as his more dangerous enemies. Constrained by the e policy, he dreaded the danger of associating himself with the d Protestants in the Low Countries, and was obliged to renounce t inviting opportunity of revenging himself for all the hostile s and enterprises of Philip.



The states, reduced to this extremity, sent over a solemn embassy to London, and made anew an offer to the queen of acknowledging her for their n, on condition of obtaining her protection and assistance.

Elizabeth’s wisest counsellors were divided in opinion with regard to the t which she should hold in this critical and important emergence.

Some advised her to reject the offer of the states, and represented the t dangers, as well as injustice, attending the acceptance of it.

They said, that the suppression of rebellious subjects was the common e of all sovereigns; and any encouragement given to the revolt of the Flemings, might prove the example of a like pernicious license to the English; that though princes were bound by the laws of the Supreme Being t to oppress their subjects, the people never were entitled to forget l duty to their sovereign, or transfer, from every fancy or disgust, or n from the justest ground of complaint, their obedience to any other r: that the queen, in the succors hitherto afforded the Flemings, had d them as laboring under oppression, not as entitled to freedom; d had intended only to admonish Philip not to persevere in his tyranny, t any view of ravishing from him those provinces, which he enjoyed y hereditary right from his ancestors: that her situation in Ireland, and n in England, would afford that powerful monarch sufficient opportunity f retaliating upon her; and she must thenceforth expect that, instead of y fomenting faction, he would openly employ his whole force in the n and defence of the Catholics: that the pope would undoubtedly e his spiritual arms to the temporal ones of Spain: and that the queen d soon repent her making so precarious an acquisition in foreign s, by exposing her own dominions to the most imminent danger.[*]



Other counsellors of Elizabeth maintained a contrary opinion. They d, that the queen had not even from the beginning of her reign, but y had not at present, the choice whether she would embrace p or hostility with Philip: that by the whole tenor of that e’s conduct it appeared, that his sole aims were the extending of his e, and the entire subjection of the Protestants, under the specious e of maintaining the Catholic faith: that the provocations which e had already given him, joined to his general scheme of policy, would r render him her implacable enemy; and as soon as he had subdued his d subjects, he would undoubtedly fall, with the whole force of his d empire, on her defenceless state: that the only question was, r she would maintain a war abroad, and supported by allies, or wait l the subjection of all the confederates of England should give her s leisure to begin their hostilities in the bowels of the kingdom: t the revolted provinces, though in a declining condition, possessed l considerable force; and by the assistance of England, by the s of their situation, and by their inveterate antipathy to Philip, might still be enabled to maintain the contest against the Spanish y that their maritime power, united to the queen’s, would give her e security on the side from which alone she could be assaulted; and d even enable her to make inroads on Philip’s dominions, both in Europe and the Indies: that a war which was necessary could never be t; and self-defence was concerned as well in preventing certain s at a distance, as in repelling any immediate invasion: and that, e hostility with Spain was the unavoidable consequence of the present s and situations of the two monarchies, it were better to e that danger and loss by the acquisition of such important s to the English empire.[*]



Amidst these opposite counsels, the queen, apprehensive of the s attending each extreme, was inclined to steer a middle e; and though such conduct is seldom prudent, she was not, in this n, guided by any prejudice or mistaken affection. She was d not to permit, without opposition, the total subjection of the d provinces, whose interests she deemed so closely connected with r own: but foreseeing that the acceptance of their sovereignty would e her to employ her whole force in their defence, would give umbrage o her neighbors, and would expose her to the reproach of ambition and n,—imputations which hitherto she had carefully avoided,—she y rejected this offer. She concluded a league with the states on e following conditions: that she should send over an army to their e, of five thousand foot and a thousand horse, and pay them g the war; that the general, and two others whom she should appoint, d be admitted into the council of the states; that neither party d make peace without the consent of the other; that her expenses d be refunded after the conclusion of the war; and that the towns of Flushing and the Brille, with the Castle of Rammekins, should, in the mean e, be consigned into her hands by way of security.



The queen knew that this measure would immediately engage her in open s with Philip; yet was not she terrified with the view of the t greatness of that monarch. The continent of Spain was at that time h and populous; and the late addition of Portugal, besides securing l tranquillity, had annexed an opulent kingdom to Philip’s s, had made him master of many settlements in the East Indies, and f the whole commerce of those regions, and had much increased his naval r, in which he was before chiefly deficient. All the princes of Italy, n the pope and the court of Rome, were reduced to a kind of subjection r him, and seemed to possess their sovereignty on terms somewhat s. The Austrian branch in Germany, with their dependent s, was closely connected with him, and was ready to supply m with troops for every enterprise. All the treasures of the West Indies e in his possession; and the present scarcity of the precious metals in y country of Europe, rendered the influence of his riches the more e and extensive. The Netherlands seemed on the point of relapsing o servitude; and small hopes were entertained of their withstanding e numerous and veteran armies, which, under the command of the most d generals, he employed against them. Even France, which was t to counterbalance the Austrian greatness, had lost all her force from e commotions; and as the Catholics, the ruling party, were closely d with him, he rather expected thence an augmentation than a n of his power. Upon the whole, such prepossessions were every e entertained concerning the force of the Spanish monarchy, that the g of Sweden, when he heard that Elizabeth had openly embraced the e of the revolted Flemings, scrupled not to say, that she had now n the diadem from her head, and had adventured it upon the doubtful e of war.[*]



Yet was this princess rather cautious than enterprising in her natural r: she ever needed more to be impelled by the vigor, than restrained y the prudence, of her ministers: but when she saw an evident necessity, e braved danger with magnanimous courage; and trusting to her own e wisdom, and to the affections, however divided, of her people, e prepared herself to resist, and even to assault, the whole force of e Catholic monarch.



The earl of Leicester was sent over to Holland at the head of the English y forces. He carried with him a splendid retinue; being d by the young earl of Essex, his son-in-law, the lords Audley d North, Sir William Russel, Sir Thomas Shirley, Sir Arthur Basset, Sir Walter Waller, Sir Gervase Clifton, and a select troop of five hundred n. He was received on his arrival at Flushing by his nephew, Sir Philip Sidney, the governor; and every town through which he passed d their joy by acclamations and triumphal arches, as if his e and the queen’s protection had brought them the most certain e. The states, desirous of engaging Elizabeth still further in r defence, and knowing the interest which Leicester possessed with r, conferred on him the title of governor and captain-general of the d provinces, appointed a guard to attend him, and treated him in some s as their sovereign. But this step had a contrary effect to what y expected. The queen was displeased with the artifice of the states, d the ambition of Leicester. She severely reprimanded both; and it was h some difficulty that, after many humble admissions, they were able to e her.



America was regarded as the chief source of Philip’s power, as well as the t defenceless part of his dominions, and Elizabeth, finding that an n breach with that monarch was unavoidable, resolved not to leave him d in that quarter. The great success of the Spaniards and Portuguese in both Indies had excited a spirit of emulation in England; d as the progress of commerce, still more that of colonies, is slow and l, it was happy that a war in this critical period had opened a more g prospect to the avarice and ambition of the English, and had d them, by the view of sudden and exorbitant profit, to engage in l enterprises. A fleet of twenty sail was equipped to attack the Spaniards in the West Indies: two thousand three hundred volunteers, s seamen, engaged on board of it; Sir Francis Drake was appointed l; Christopher Carlisle, commander of the land forces.



1586.



They took St. Jago, near Cape Verde, by surprise; and found in it plenty f provisions, but no riches. They sailed to Hispaniola; and easily making s masters of St. Domingo by assault, obliged the inhabitants to m their houses by a sum of money. Carthagena fell next into their s, after some more resistance, and was treated in the same manner.

They burnt St. Anthony and St. Helens, two towns on the coast of Florida.

Sailing along the coast of Virginia, they found the small remains of a y which had been planted there by Sir Walter Raleigh, and which had e extremely to decay. This was the first attempt of the English to form h settlements; and though they have since surpassed all European s, both in the situation of their colonies, and in the noble s of liberty and industry on which they are founded, they had e been so unsuccessful, that the miserable planters abandoned their s, and prevailed on Drake to carry them with him to England. He d with so much riches as encouraged the volunteers, and with such s of the Spanish weakness in those countries, as served extremely o inflame the spirits of the nation to future enterprises. The great y which the climate had produced in his fleet was, as is usual, t a feeble restraint on the avidity and sanguine hopes of young s.[*] It is thought that Drake’s fleet first introduced the use f tobacco into England.



The enterprises of Leicester were much less successful than those of Drake. This man possessed neither courage nor capacity equal to the trust d in him by the queen; and as he was the only bad choice she made r any considerable employment, men naturally believed that she had here n influenced by an affection still more partial than that of p. He gained, at first, some advantage in an action against the Spaniards; and threw succors into Grave, by which that place was enabled o make a vigorous defence: but the cowardice of the governor, Van Hemert, d all these efforts useless. He capitulated after a feeble e; and being tried for his conduct, suffered a capital punishment m the sentence of a court martial. The prince of Parma next undertook e siege of Venlo, which was surrendered to him after some resistance.

The fate of Nuys was more dismal; being taken by assault, while the n was treating of a capitulation. Rhimberg, which was garrisoned by e hundred English, under the command of Colonel Morgan, was s besieged by the Spaniards; and Leicester, thinking himself too k to attempt raising the siege, endeavored to draw off the prince of Parma by forming another enterprise. He first attacked Doesberg, and d: he then sat down before Zutphen, which the Spanish general t so important a fortress, that he hastened to its relief. He made e marquis of Guasto advance with a convoy, which he intended to throw o the place. They were favored by a fog; but falling by accident on a y of English cavalry, a furious action ensued, in which the Spaniards e worsted, and the marquis of Gonzaga, an Italian nobleman of great n and family was slain. The pursuit was stopped by the advance of e prince of Parma with the main body of the Spanish army; and the English cavalry, on their return from the field, found their advantage e than compensated by the loss of Sir Philip Sidney, who, being y wounded in the action, was carried off by the soldiers, and soon r died. This person is described by the writers of that age, as the t perfect model of an accomplished gentleman that could be formed even y the wanton imagination of poetry or fiction. Virtuous conduct, polite n, heroic valor, and elegant erudition, all concurred to render m the ornament and delight of the English court; and as the credit which e possessed with the queen and the earl of Leicester was wholly employed n the encouragement of genius and literature, his praises have been d with advantage to posterity. No person was so low as not to e an object of his humanity. After this last action, while he was g on the field mangled with wounds, a bottle of water was brought him o relieve his thirst; but observing a soldier near him in a like e condition, he said, “This man’s necessity is still greater than e;” and resigned to him the bottle of water. The king of Scots, struck h admiration of Sidney’s virtue, celebrated his memory in a copy of Latin verses, which he composed on the death of that young hero.



ENLARGE The English, though a long peace had deprived them of all experience, were y possessed of military genius; and the advantages gained by the e of Parma were not attributed to the superior bravery and discipline f the Spaniards, but solely to the want of military abilities in Leicester. The states were much discontented with his management of the r; still more with his arbitrary and imperious conduct; and at the end f the campaign, they applied to him for a redress of all their s. But Leicester, without giving them any satisfaction, departed n after for England.[*]



The queen, while she provoked so powerful an enemy as the king of Spain, s not forgetful to secure herself on the side of Scotland; and she d both to cultivate the friendship and alliance of her kinsman James, and to remove all grounds of quarrel between them. An attempt which e had made some time before was not well calculated to gain Ihe e of that prince. She had despatched Wotton as her ambassador to Scotland; but though she gave him private instructions with regard to her s, she informed James, that when she had any political business to s with him, she would employ another minister; that this man was not d for serious negotiations; and that her chief purpose in sending m, was to entertain the king with witty and facetious conversation, and o partake without reserve of his pleasures and amusements. Wotton was r of profound dissimulation, and knew how to cover, under the e of a careless gayety, the deepest designs and most dangerous s. When but a youth of twenty, he had been employed by his uncle, Dr. Wotton, ambassador in France during the reign of Mary, to insnare the e Montmorency; and had not his purpose been frustrated by pure t, his cunning had prevailed over all the caution and experience of t aged minister. It is no wonder that, after years had improved him in l the arts of deceit, he should gain an ascendant over a young prince of o open and unguarded a temper as James; especially when the queen’s n prepared the way for his reception. He was admitted into l the pleasures of the king; made himself master of his secrets; and had o much the more authority with him in political transactions, as he did t seem to pay the least attention to these matters. The Scottish s, who observed the growing interest of this man, endeavored to e his friendship; and scrupled not to sacrifice to his intrigues the t essential interests of their master. Elizabeth’s usual jealousies h regard to her heirs began now to be levelled against James; and as t prince had attained the years proper for marriage, she was e lest, by being strengthened by children and alliances, he d acquire the greater interest and authority with her English s. She directed Wotton to form a secret concert with some Scottish n, and to procure their promise, that James, during three years, d not on any account be permitted to marry. In consequence of this w, they endeavored to embroil him with the king of Denmark, who had t ambassadors to Scotland on pretence of demanding restitution of the Orkneys, but really with a view of opening a proposal of marriage between James and his daughter. Wotton is said to have employed his intrigues to s still more dangerous. He formed, it is pretended, a conspiracy h some malecontents, to seize the person of the king, and to deliver m into the hands of Elizabeth, who would probably have denied all e in the design, but would have been sure to retain him in l thraldom, if not captivity. The conspiracy was detected; and Wotton fled hastily from Scotland, without taking leave of the king.[*]



James’s situation obliged him to dissemble his resentment of this s attempt, and his natural temper inclined him soon to forgive d forget it. The queen, found no difficulty in renewing the negotiations r a strict alliance between Scotland and England; and the more y to gain the prince’s friendship, she granted him a pension, t to his claim on the inheritance of his grand mother, the s of Lenox, lately deceased.[**] A league was formed between Elizabeth and James for the mutual defence of their dominions and of their n, now menaced by the open combination of all the Catholic powers f Europe. It was stipulated, that if Elizabeth were invaded, James should d her with a body of two thousand horse and five thousand foot; that Elizabeth, in a like case, should send to his assistance three thousand e and six thousand foot; that the charge of these armies should be d by the prince who demanded assistance; that if the invasion d be made upon England, within sixty miles of the frontiers of Scotland, this latter kingdom should march its whole force to the e of the former; and that the present league should supersede all r alliances of either state with any foreign kingdom, so far as n was concerned.[***]



By this league, James secured himself against all attempts from abroad, d a way for acquiring the confidence and affections of the English, d might entertain some prospect of domestic tranquillity, which, while e lived on bad terms with Elizabeth, he could never expect long to enjoy.

Besides the turbulent disposition and inveterate feuds of the nobility,—ancient s of the Scottish government,—the spirit of fanaticism had d a new disorder; so much the more dangerous, as religion, when d by false opinion, is not restrained by any rules of morality, d is even scarcely to be accounted for in its operations by any s of ordinary conduct and policy. The insolence of the preachers, o triumphed in their dominion over the populace, had at this time d an extreme height; and they carried their arrogance so far, not y against the king, but against the whole civil power, that they d the archbishop of St. Andrews, because he had been active n parliament for promoting a law which restrained their seditious s; [*] nor could that prelate save himself by any expedient from s terrible sentence, but by renouncing all pretensions to l authority. One Gibson said in the pulpit that Captain James Stuart (meaning the late earl of Arran) and his wife, Jezebel, had been d the chief persecutors of the church; but it was now seen that the g himself was the great offender; and for this crime the preacher d against him the curse which fell on Jeroboam, that he should die s, and be the last of his race.[**]



The secretary, Thirlstone, perceiving the king so much molested with l affairs, and with the refractory disposition of the clergy, d him to leave them to their own courses; for that in a short time y would become so intolerable, that the people would rise against them, d drive them out of the country. “True,” replied the king; “if I d to undo the church and religion, your counsel were good; but my n is to maintain both; therefore cannot I suffer the clergy to w such a conduct, as will in the end bring religion into contempt and n.”[***]









1586.



The dangers which arose from the character, principles, and pretensions of e queen of Scots, had very early engaged Elizabeth to consult, in her t of that unfortunate princess, the dictates of jealousy and s, rather than of friendship or generosity: resentment of this e had pushed Mary into enterprises which had nearly threatened the e and authority of Elizabeth: the rigor and restraint thence d upon the captive queen,[*] still impelled her to attempt greater s; and while her impatience of confinement, her revenge,[**] 20 and r high spirit concurred with religious zeal, and the suggestions of e bigots, she was at last engaged in designs which afforded her s, who watched the opportunity, a pretence or reason for effecting r final ruin.



The English seminary at Rheims had wrought themselves up to a high pitch f rage and animosity against the queen. The recent persecutions from h they had escaped; the new rigors which they knew awaited them in the e of their missions; the liberty which for the present they enjoyed f declaiming against that princess; and the contagion of that religious y which every where surrounded them in France; all these causes had d with them every maxim of common sense, and every principle of s or humanity. Intoxicated with admiration of the divine power and y of the pope, they revered his bull by which he d and deposed the queen; and some of them had gone to that t of extravagance as to assert, that that performance had been y dictated by the Holy Ghost. The assassination of heretical s, and of that princess in particular, was represented as the t meritorious of all enterprises; and they taught, that whoever d in such pious attempts, enjoyed, without dispute, the glorious d never-fading crown of martyrdom. By such doctrines, they instigated John Savage, a man of desperate courage, who had served some years in the Low Countries under the prince of Parma, to attempt the life of Elizabeth; d this assassin, having made a vow to persevere in his design, was sent r to England, and recommended to the confidence of the more zealous Catholics.



About the same time, John Ballard, a priest of that seminary, had returned o Paris from his mission in England and Scotland; and as he had observed a spirit of mutiny and rebellion to be very prevalent among the Catholic s in these countries, he had founded on that disposition the t of dethroning Elizabeth, and of restoring by force of arms the e of the ancient religion.[*] The situation of affairs abroad d favorable to this enterprise; the pope, the Spaniard, the duke of Guise, concurring in interests, had formed a resolution to make some t against England: and Mendoza, the Spanish ambassador at Paris, y encouraged Ballard to hope for succors from these princes.

Charles Paget alone, a zealous Catholic and a devoted partisan of the n of Scots, being well acquainted with the prudence, vigor, and l popularity of Elizabeth, always maintained that, so long as that s was allowed to live, it was in vain to expect any success from an e upon England. Ballard, persuaded of this truth, saw more y the necessity of executing the design formed at Rheims; he came r to England in the disguise of a soldier, and assumed the name of Captain Fortescue; and he bent his endeavors to effect at once the project f an assassination, an insurrection, and an invasion.[**]



The first person to whom he addressed himself was Anthony Babington, of Dethic, in the county of Derby. This young gentleman was of a good family, d a plentiful fortune, had discovered an excellent capacity, and s accomplished in literature beyond most of his years or station. Being y devoted to the Catholic communion, he had secretly made a y to Paris some time before, and had fallen into intimacy with Thomas Morgan, a bigoted fugitive from England, and with the bishop of Glasgow, Mary’s ambassador at the court of France. By continually g the amiable accomplishments and heroical virtues of that s, they impelled the sanguine and unguarded mind of young Babington o make some attempt for her service; and they employed every principle of n, gallantry, and religious zeal, to give him a contempt of those s which attended any enterprise against the vigilant government of Elizabeth. Finding him well disposed for their purpose, they sent him back o England, and secretly, unknown to himself, recommended him to the queen f Scots, as a person worth engaging in her service. She wrote him a r, full of friendship and confidence; and Babington, ardent in his r and zealous in his principles, thought that these advances now d him in honor to devote himself entirely to the service of that e princess. During some time, he had found means of conveying to r all her foreign correspondence; but after she was put under the y of Sir Amias Paulet, and reduced to a more rigorous confinement, e experienced so much difficulty and danger in rendering her this e, that he had desisted from every attempt of that nature.



When Ballard began to open his intentions to Babington, he found his zeal d, not extinguished: his former ardor revived on the mention of y enterprise which seemed to promise success in the cause of Mary and of e Catholic religion. He had entertained sentiments conformable to those f Paget, and represented the folly of all attempts which, during the e of Elizabeth, could be formed against the established religion d government of England. Ballard, encouraged by this hint, proceeded to r to him the design undertaken by Savage;[*] and was well pleased o observe that, instead of being shocked with the project, Babington only t it not secure enough, when intrusted to one single hand, and d to join five others with Savage in this desperate enterprise.



In prosecution of these views, Babington employed himself in increasing e number of his associates; and he secretly drew into the conspiracy y Catholic gentlemen, discontented with the present government.

Barnwell, of a noble family in Ireland, Charnoc, a gentleman of Lancashire, and Abington, whose father had been cofferer to the household y undertook the assassination of the queen. Charles Tilney, the heir f an ancient family, and Titchborne of Southampton, when the design was d to them, expressed some scruples, which were removed by the s of Babington and Ballard. Savage alone refused, during some e, to share the glory of the enterprise with any others;[*] he d the whole to himself; and it was with some difficulty he was d to depart from this preposterous ambition.



The deliverance of the queen of Scots, at the very same instant when Elizabeth should be assassinated, was requisite for effecting the purpose f the conspirators; and Babington undertook, with a party of a hundred e, to attack her guards while she should be taking the air on k. In this enterprise, he engaged Edward Windsor, brother to the d of that name, Thomas Salisbury, Robert Gage, John Travers, John Jones, and Henry Donne; most of them men of family and interest. The s much wanted, but could not find, any nobleman of note whom y might place at the head of the enterprise; but they trusted that the t events, of the queen’s death and Mary’s deliverance, would rouse all e zealous Catholics to arms; and that foreign forces, taking advantage f the general confusion, would easily fix the queen of Scots on the e, and reestablish the ancient religion.



These desperate projects had not escaped the vigilance of Elizabeth’s l, particularly of Walsingham, secretary of state. That artful r had engaged Maud, a Catholic priest, whom he retained in pay, to d Ballard in his journey to France, and had thereby got a hint of the s entertained by the fugitives. Polly, another of his spies, had d means to insinuate himself among the conspirators in England; and, h not entirely trusted, had obtained some insight into their s secrets. But the bottom of the conspiracy was never fully known, l Gifford, a seminary priest, came over and made a tender of his s to Walsingham. By his means, the discovery became of the utmost e, and involved the fate of Mary, as well as of those zealous s of that princess.



Babington and his associates, having laid such a plan as, they thought, d infallible success, were impatient to communicate the design to e queen of Scots, and to obtain her approbation and concurrence. For s service they employed Gifford, who immediately applied to Walsingham, t the interest of that minister might forward his secret correspondence h Mary. Walsingham proposed the matter to Paulet, and desired him to e at Gifford’s corrupting one of his servants; but Paulet, averse to e introducing of such a pernicious precedent into his family, desired t they would rather think of some other expedient. Gifford found a r, who supplied the family with ale; and bribed him to convey letters o the captive queen. The letters, by Paulet’s connivance, were thrust h a chink in the wall; and answers were returned by the same e.



Ballard and Babington were at first diffident of Gifford’s fidelity; and o make trial of him, they gave him only blank papers made up like s; but finding by the answers that these had been faithfully d, they laid aside all further scruple, and conveyed by his hands e most criminal and dangerous parts of their conspiracy. Babington d Mary of the design laid for a foreign invasion, the plan of an n at home, the scheme for her deliverance, and the conspiracy r assassinating the usurper, by six noble gentlemen, as he termed them, l of them his private friends; who, from the zeal which they bore to the Catholic cause and her majesty’s service, would undertake the “tragical n.” Mary replied, that she approved highly of the design; that the n might expect all the rewards which it should ever be in her r to confer; and that the death of Elizabeth was a necessary e, before any attempts were made, either for her own e or an insurrection.[*]



These letters, with others to Mendoza, Charles Paget, the archbishop of Glasgow, and Sir Francis Inglefield, were carried by Gifford to Secretary Walsingham; were deciphered by the art of Philips, his clerk; and copies n of them. Walsingham employed another artifice, in order to obtain l insight into the plot: he subjoined to a letter of Mary’s a t in the same cipher; in which he made her desire Babington to m her of the names of the conspirators. The indiscretion of Babington d Walsingham with still another means of detection, as well as of e. That gentlemen had caused a picture to be drawn, where he himself s represented standing amidst the six assassins; and a motto was d, expressing that their common perils were the band of their y. A copy of this picture was brought to Elizabeth, that she t know the assassins, and guard herself against their approach to her n.



Meanwhile Babington, anxious to insure and hasten the foreign succors, d to despatch Ballard into France; and he procured for him, under a d name, a license to travel. In order to remove from himself all n, he applied to Walsingharn, pretended great zeal for the queen’s e, offered to go abroad, and professed his intentions of employing e confidence which he had gained among the Catholics, to the detection d disappointment of their conspiracies. Walsingham commended his loyal s; and promising his own counsel and assistance in the execution of m, still fed him with hopes, and maintained a close correspondence with m. A warrant, meanwhile, was issued for seizing Ballard; and this t, joined to the consciousness of guilt, begat in all the s the utmost anxiety and concern. Some advised that they should y make their escape; others proposed that Savage and Charnoc d without delay execute their purpose against Elizabeth; and Babington, in prosecution of this scheme, furnished Savage with money, t he might buy good clothes, and thereby have more easy access to the n’s person. Next day, they began to apprehend that they had taken the m too hastily; and Babington, having renewed his correspondence with Walsingham, was persuaded by that subtle minister, that the seizure of Ballard had proceeded entirely from the usual diligence of informers in e detection of popish and seminary priests. He even consented to take s secretly in Walsingham’s house, that they might have more t conferences together before his intended departure for France; t observing that he was watched and guarded, he made his escape, and e the alarm to the other conspirators. They all took to flight, covered s with several disguises, and lay concealed in woods or barns; t were soon discovered and thrown into prison. In their examinations y contradicted each other, and the leaders were obliged to make a full n of the truth. Fourteen were condemned and executed, of whom n, acknowledged the crime on their trial; the rest were convicted by e.



The lesser conspirators being despatched, measures were taken for the l and conviction of the queen of Scots; on whose account, and with e concurrence, these attempts had been made against the life of the n, and the tranquillity of the kingdom. Some of Elizabeth’s s were averse to this procedure, and thought that the close t of a woman who was become very sickly, and who would probably t a speedy period to their anxiety by her natural death, might give t security to the government without attempting a measure of h there scarcely remains any example in history. Leicester advised t Mary should be secretly despatched by poison; and he sent a divine to e Walsingham of the lawfulness of that action: but Walsingham d his abhorrence of it; and still insisted, in conjunction with the y of the counsellors, for the open trial of the queen of Scots. The n of England, and of the English ministers, had, indeed, been o not a little dangerous. No successor of the crown was declared; t the heir of blood, to whom the people in general were likely to e, was, by education, an enemy to the national religion; was, from d provocations, an enemy to the ministers and principal nobility; d their personal safety, as well as the safety of the public, seemed to d alone on the queen’s life, who was now somewhat advanced in years.

No wonder, therefore, that Elizabeth’s counsellors, knowing themselves to e so obnoxious to the queen of Scots, endeavored to push every measure to s against her; and were even more anxious than the queen f, to prevent her from ever mounting the throne of England.



Though all England was acquainted with the detection of Babington’s y, every avenue to the queen of Scots had been so strictly d, that she remained in utter ignorance of the matter; and it was a t surprise to her, when Sir Thomas Gorges, by Elizabeth’s orders, d her, that all her accomplices were discovered and arrested. He e the time for giving her this intelligence when she was mounted on k to go a hunting; and she was not permitted to return to her r place of abode, but war conducted from one gentleman’s house to r, till she was lodged in Fotheringay Castle, in the County of Northampton, which it was determined to make the last stage of her trial d sufferings. Her two secretaries, Nau, a Frenchman, and Curle, a Scot, e immediately arrested: all her papers were seized, and sent up to the l: above sixty different keys to ciphers were discovered: there were o found many letters from persons beyond sea, and several too from English noblemen containing expressions of respect and attachment. The n took no notice of this latter discovery; but the persons themselves, g their correspondence to be detected, though that they had no other s of making atonement for their imprudence, than by declaring s thenceforth the most inveterate enemies of the queen of Scots.[*]



It was resolved to try Mary, not by the common statute of treasons, but by e act which had passed the former year with a view to this very event; d the queen, in terms of that act, appointed a commission, consisting of y noblemen and privy counsellors, and empowered them to examine and s sentence on Mary, whom she denominated the late queen of Scots, and r to James V. of Scotland. The commissioners came to Fotheringay Castle, and sent to her Sir Walter Mildmay, Sir Amias Paulet, and Edward Barker, who delivered her a letter from Elizabeth, informing her of the n, and of the approaching trial. Mary received the intelligence t emotion or astonishment. She said, however, that it seemed strange o her, that the queen should command her, as a subject, to submit to a l and examination before subjects; that she was an absolute, t princess, and would yield to nothing which might derogate r from her royal majesty, from the state of sovereign princes, or m the dignity and rank of her son: that, however oppressed by s, she was not yet so much broken in spirit as her enemies d themselves; nor would she, on any account, be accessary to her n degradation and dishonor: that she was ignorant of the laws and s of England; was utterly destitute of counsel; and could not e who were entitled to be called her peers, or could legally sit as s on her trial: that though she had lived in England for many years, e had lived in captivity; and not having received the protection of the s, she could not, merely by her involuntary residence in the country, e supposed to have subjected herself to their jurisdiction: that, g the superiority of her rank, she was willing to give an t of her conduct before an English parliament; but could not view e commissioners in any other light than as men appointed to justify, y some color of legal proceeding, her condemnation and execution: and t she warned them to look to their conscience and their character in g an innocent person; and to reflect, that these transactions would e be subject to revisal, and that the theatre of the whole world s much wider than the kingdom of England.



In return, the commissioners sent a new deputation, informing her, that r plea, either from her royal dignity or from her imprisonment, could t be admitted; and that they were empowered to proceed to her trial, n though she should refuse to answer before them. Burleigh, the r, and Bromley, the chancellor, employed much reasoning to make r submit; but the person whose arguments had the chief influence, was Sir Christopher Hatton, vice-chamberlain. His speech was to this purpose:

“You are accused, madam,” said he, “but not condemned, of having conspired e destruction of our lady and queen anointed. You say you are a queen; t, in such a crime as this, and such a situation as yours, the royal y itself, neither by the civil or canon law, nor by the law of e or of nations, is exempt from judgment. If you be innocent, you g your reputation in avoiding a trial. We have been present at your s of innocence; but Queen Elizabeth thinks otherwise, and is y sorry for the appearances which lie against you. To examine, e, your cause, she has appointed commissioners; honorable persons, t and upright men, who are ready to hear you with equity, and even h favor, and will rejoice if you can clear yourself of the imputations h have been thrown upon you. Believe me, madam, the queen herself will e, who affirmed to me, at my departure, that nothing which ever l her had given her so much uneasiness, as that you should be d of a concurrence in these criminal enterprises. Laying aside, e, the fruitless claim of privilege from your royal dignity, which n now avail you nothing, trust to the better defence of your innocence, e it appear in open trial, and leave not upon your memory that stain of y which must attend your obstinate silence on this occasion.” [*]



By this artful speech, Mary was persuaded to answer before the court; and y gave an appearance of legal procedure to the trial, and prevented e difficulties which the commissioners must have fallen into, had she d in maintaining so specious a plea as that of her sovereign and t character. Her conduct in this particular must be regarded as e more imprudent; because formerly, when Elizabeth’s commissioners d not to exercise any jurisdiction over her, and only entered into r cause by her own consent and approbation, she declined justifying f, when her honor, which ought to have been dearer to her than life, d absolutely to require it.



On her first appearance before the commissioners, Mary, either sensible of r imprudence, or still unwilling to degrade herself by submitting to a l, renewed her protestation against the authority of her judges: the r answered her, by pleading the supreme authority of the English s over every one who resided in England; and the commissioners d matters, by ordering both her protestation and his answer to e recorded.



The lawyers of the crown then opened the charge against the queen of Scots. They proved, by intercepted letters, that she had allowed Cardinal Allen and others to treat her as queen of England; and that she had kept a e with Lord Paget and Charles Paget, in view of engaging the Spaniards to invade the kingdom. Mary seemed not anxious to clear herself m either of these imputations. She only said that she could not hinder s from using what style they pleased in writing to her; and that she t lawfully try every expedient for the recovery of her liberty.



An intercepted letter of hers to Mendoza was next produced; in which she d to transfer to Philip her right to the kingdom of England, if her n should refuse to be converted to the Catholic faith; an event, she e said, of which there was no expectation while he remained in the s of his Scottish subjects.[*]



Even this part of the charge she took no pains to deny, or rather she d to acknowledge it. She said that she had no kingdoms to dispose of; t was it lawful for her to give at her pleasure what was her own, and e was not accountable to any for her actions. She added, that she had y rejected that proposal from Spain; but now, since all her hopes n England were gone, she was fully determined not to refuse foreign e. There was also produced evidence to prove, that Allen and Parsons were at that very time negotiating, by her orders, at Rome, the s of transferring her English crown to the king of Spain, and of g her heretical son.[*] 21


It is remarkable, that Mary’s prejudices against her son were at this time d so far, that she had even entered into a conspiracy against him, d appointed Lord Claud Hamilton regent of Scotland, and had instigated r adherents to seize James’s person, and deliver him into the hands of e pope, or the king of Spain; whence he was never to be delivered, but n condition of his becoming Catholic.[**] 24


The only part of the charge which Mary positively denied, was her e in the design of assassinating Elizabeth. This article, d, was the most heavy, and the only one that could fully justify the n in proceeding to extremities against her. In order to prove the n, there were produced the following evidence: copies taken in Secretary Walsingham’s office of the intercepted letters between her and Babington, in which her approbation of the murder was clearly expressed; e evidence of her two secretaries, Nau and Curle, who had confessed, t being put to any torture, both that she received these letters m Babington, and that they had written the answers by her order; the n of Babington, that he had written the letters and received the s,[***] and the confession of Ballard and Savage, that Babington had d them these letters of Mary, written in the cipher which had been d between them.



It is evident, that this complication of evidence, though every e corroborates the general conclusion, resolves itself finally o the testimony of the two secretaries, who alone were certainly d with their mistress’s concurrence in Babington’s conspiracy, t who knew themselves exposed to all the rigors of imprisonment, e, and death, if they refused to give any evidence which might be d of them. In the case of an ordinary criminal, this proof, with l its disadvantages, would be esteemed legal, and even satisfactory, if t opposed by some other circumstances which shake the credit of the s: but on the present trial, where the absolute power of the r concurred with such important interests, and such a violent n to have the princess condemned, the testimony of two s, even though men of character, ought to be supported by strong s, in order to remove all suspicion of tyranny and injustice.

The proof against Mary, it must be confessed, is not destitute of this e; and it is difficult, if not impossible, to account for Babington’s receiving an answer written in her name, and in the cipher d between them, without allowing that the matter had been d to that princess. Such is the light in which this matter s, even after time has discovered every thing which could guide our t with regard to it: no wonder, therefore, that the queen of Scots, d by counsel, and confounded by so extraordinary a trial, found f incapable of making a satisfactory defence before the s. Her reply consisted chiefly in her own denial: whatever e may be in that denial was much weakened by her positively affirming, t she never had had any correspondence of any kind with Babington; a t, however, of which there remains not the least question.[*] 25 She d, that as Nau and Curle had taken an oath of secrecy and fidelity o her, their evidence against her ought not to be credited. She d, however, that Nau had been in the service of her uncle, the l of Lorraine, and had been recommended to her by the king of France, as a man in whom she might safely confide. She also acknowledged Curle to be a very honest man, but simple and easily imposed on by Nau. If e two men had received any letters, or had written any answers, t her knowledge, the imputation, she said, could never lie on her.

And she was the more inclined, she added, to entertain this suspicion t them, because Nau had, in other instances, been guilty of a like y, and had ventured to transact business in her name, without g the matter to her.[**] 26


The sole circumstance of her defence which to us may appear to have some e, was her requiring that Nau and Cure should be confronted with her, d her affirming that they never would to her face persist in their e. But that demand, however equitable, was not then supported by w in trials of high treason, and was often refused, even in other trials e the crown was prosecutor. The clause contained in an act of the h of the queen, was a novelty; that the species of treason there d must be proved by two witnesses, confronted with the criminal.

But Mary was not tried upon that act; and the ministers and crown lawyers f this reign were always sure to refuse every indulgence beyond what the t letter of the law, and the settled practice of the courts of e, required of them. Not to mention, that these secretaries were not y at Fotheringay Castle during the time of the trial, and could t, upon Mary’s demand, be produced before the commissioners.[*]



There passed two incidents in this trial which may be worth observing. A r between Mary and Babington was read, in which mention was made of e earl of Arundel and his brothers: on hearing their names, she broke o a sigh. “Alas,” said she, “what has the noble house of the Howards d for my sake!” She affirmed, with regard to the same letter, that t was easy to forge the handwriting and cipher of another; she was afraid t this was too familiar a practice with Walsingham, who, she also d, had frequently practised both against her life and her son’s.

Walsingham, who was one of the commissioners, rose up. He protested that, n his private capacity, he had never acted any thing against the queen of Scots: in his public capacity, he owned, that his concern for his n’s safety had made him very diligent in searching out, by every t, all designs against her sacred person or her authority. For g that end, he would not only make use of the assistance of Ballard or any other conspirator; he would also reward them for betraying r companions. But if he had tampered in any manner unbefitting his r and office, why did none of the late criminals, either at their l or execution accuse him of such practices? Mary endeavored to pacify m, by saying that she spoke from information; and she begged him to give h no more credit to such as slandered her, than she should to h as accused him. The great character, indeed, which Sir Francis Walsingham bears for probity and honor, should remove from him all n of such base arts as forgery and subornation; arts which even e most corrupt ministers, in the most corrupt times, would scruple to y.



Having finished the trial, the commissioners, adjourned from Fotheringay Castle, and met in the star chamber at London, where, after taking the s of Mary’s two secretaries, who voluntarily, without hope or reward, d the authenticity of those letters before produced, they pronounced e of death upon the queen of Scots, and confirmed it by their seals d subscriptions. The same day, a declaration was published by the s and the judges “that the sentence did nowise derogate from e title and honor of James, king of Scotland; but that he was in the e place, degree, and right, as if the sentence had never been d.”[*]



The queen had now brought affairs with Mary to that situation which she d long ardently desired; and had found a plausible reason for executing e on a competitor, whom, from the beginning of her reign, she had r equally dreaded and hated. But she was restrained from instantly g her resentment, by several important considerations. She w the invidious colors in which this example of uncommon n would be represented by the numerous partisans of Mary, and e reproach to which she herself might be exposed with all foreign s, perhaps with all posterity. The rights of hospitality, of d, and of royal majesty, seemed in one signal instance to be all d; and this sacrifice of generosity to interest, of clemency to e, might appear equally unbecoming a sovereign and a woman.

Elizabeth, therefore, who was an excellent hypocrite, pretended the utmost e to proceed to the execution of the sentence; affected the most r sympathy with her prisoner; displayed all her scruples and s; rejected the solicitation of her courtiers and ministers; d affirmed that, were she not moved by the deepest concern for her e’s safety, she would not hesitate a moment in pardoning all the s which she herself had received from the queen of Scots.



That the voice of her people might be more audibly heard in the demand of e upon Mary, she summoned a new parliament; and she knew, both from e usual dispositions of that assembly, and from the influence of her s over them, that she should not want the most earnest n to consent to that measure which was so agreeable to her t inclinations. She did not open this assembly in person, but d for that purpose three commissioners, Bromley, the chancellor, Burleigh, the treasurer, and the earl of Derby. The reason assigned for s measure was, that the queen, foreseeing that the affair of the queen f Scots would be canvassed in parliament, found her tenderness and y so much hurt by that melancholy incident, that she had not the e to be present while it was under deliberation, but withdrew her s from what she could not behold without the utmost reluctance and s. She was also willing, that, by this unusual precaution, the e should see the danger to which her person was hourly exposed; and d thence be more strongly incited to take vengeance on the criminal, e restless intrigues and bloody conspiracies had so long exposed her o the most imminent perils.[*]



The parliament answered the queen’s expectations: the sentence against Mary was unanimously ratified by both houses, and an application was voted o obtain Elizabeth’s consent to its publication and execution.[**] She e an answer ambiguous, embarrassed; full of real artifice, and seeming n. She mentioned the extreme danger to which her life was y exposed; she declared her willingness to die, did she not e the great calamities which would thence fall upon the nation; she e professions of the greatest tenderness to her people; she displayed e clemency of her temper, and expressed her violent reluctance to e the sentence against her unhappy kinswoman; she affirmed, that the e law, by which that princess was tried, so far from being made to e her, was only intended to give her warning beforehand, not to e in such attempts as might expose her to the penalties with which e was thus openly menaced; and she begged them to think once again, r it were possible to find any expedient, besides the death of the n of Scots, for securing the public tranquility.[***]



The parliament, in obedience to her commands, took the affair again under n; but could find no other possible expedient. They reiterated r solicitations, and entreaties, and arguments: they even d, that mercy to the queen of Scots was cruelty to them, her s and children: and they affirmed, that it were injustice to deny n of the law to any individual; much more to the whole body of the e, now unanimously and earnestly suing for this pledge of her l care and tenderness. This second address set the pretended doubts d scruples of Elizabeth anew in agitation; she complained of her now e situation; expressed her uneasiness from their importunity; d the professions of affection to her people; and dismissed the e of parliament in an uncertainty what, after all this n, might be her final resolution.[*] 27


But though the queen affected reluctance to execute the sentence against Mary, she complied with the request of parliament in publishing it by n; and this act seemed to be attended with the unanimous and y rejoicings of the people. Lord Buckhurst, and Beale, clerk of the l, were sent to the queen of Scots, and notified to her the sentence d against her, its ratification by parliament, and the earnest s made for its execution by that assembly, who thought that r religion could never, while she was alive, attain a full settlement d security. Mary was nowise dismayed at this intelligence: on the y, she joyfully laid hold of the last circumstance mentioned to r; and insisted, that since her death was demanded by the Protestants r the establishment of their faith, she was really a martyr to her n, and was entitled to all the merits attending that glorious r. She added, that the English had often imbrued their hands in e blood of their sovereigns: no wonder they exercised cruelty against r, who derived her descent from these monarchs.[**] Paulet, her keeper, d orders to take down her canopy, and to serve her no longer with e respect due to sovereign princes. He told her, that she was now to be d as a dead person, and incapable of any dignity.[***] This harsh t produced not in her any seeming emotion. She only replied, that e received her royal character from the hands of the Almighty, and no y power was ever able to bereave her of it.



The queen of Scots wrote her last letter to Elizabeth; full of dignity, t departing from that spirit of meekness and of charity which d suitable to this concluding scene of her unfortunate life. She d no petition for averting the fatal sentence: on the contrary she d her gratitude to Heaven for thus bringing to a speedy period her d and lamentable pilgrimage. She requested some favors of Elizabeth; and d her that she might be beholden for them to her own goodness e, without making applications to those ministers who had discovered h an extreme malignity against her person and her religion. She d, that after her enemies should be satiated with her innocent d, her body, which it was determined should never enjoy rest while her l was united to it, might be consigned to her servants, and be conveyed y them into France, there to repose in a Catholic land, with the sacred s of her mother. In Scotland, she said, the sepulchres of her s were violated, and the churches either demolished or profaned; d in England, where she might be interred among the ancient kings, her n and Elizabeth’s progenitors, she could entertain no hopes of being d to the grave with those rites and ceremonies which her n required. She requested, that no one might have the power of g a private death upon her, without Elizabeth’s knowledge; but t her execution should be public, and attended by her ancient servants, o might bear testimony of her perseverance in the faith, and of her n to the will of Heaven. She begged that these servants might s be allowed to depart whithersoever they pleased, and might y those legacies which she should bequeath them. And she conjured her o grant these favors by their near kindred; by the soul and memory of Henry VII., the common ancestor of both; and by the royal dignity of which y equally participated.[*] Elizabeth made no answer to this letter; g unwilling to give Mary a refusal in her present situation, and g inconveniencies from granting some of her requests.



While the queen of Scots thus prepared herself to meet her fate, great s were made by foreign powers with Elizabeth to prevent the n of the sentence pronounced against her. Besides employing L’Aubespine, the French resident at London, a creature of the house of Guise, Henry sent over BelliÃ¨vre, with a professed intention of g for the life of Mary. The duke of Guise and the league at that e threatened very nearly the king’s authority; and Elizabeth knew, that h that monarch might, from decency and policy, think himself obliged o interpose publicly in behalf of the queen of Scots, he could not y be much displeased with the death of a princess, on whose fortune d elevation his mortal enemies had always founded so many daring and s projects.[*] It is even pretended, that Bellievre had orders, r making public and vehement remonstrances against the execution of Mary, to exhort privately the queen, in his master’s name, not to defer an t of justice so necessary for their common safety.[**] But whether the French king’s intercession were sincere or not, it had no weight with the n; and she still persisted in her former resolution.



The interposition of the young king of Scots, though not able to change Elizabeth’s determination, seemed on every account to merit more regard.

As soon as James heard of the trial and condemnation of his mother, he t Sir William Keith, a gentleman of his bed-chamber, to London; and e a letter to the queen, in which he remonstrated in very severe terms t the indignity of the procedure. He said, that he was astonished to r of the presumption of English noblemen and counsellors, who had dared o sit in judgment and pass sentence upon a queen of Scotland, descended m the blood royal of England; but he was still more astonished to hear, t thoughts were seriously entertained of putting that sentence in n: that he entreated Elizabeth to reflect on the dishonor which e would draw on her name by imbruing her hands in the blood of her near n, a person of the same royal dignity and of the same sex with f: that, in this unparalleled attempt, she offered an affront to all s, and even to her own; and by reducing sovereigns to a level with r men, taught the people to neglect all duty towards those whom Providence had appointed to rule over them: that for his part, he must m the injury and insult so enormous, as to be incapable of all t; nor was it possible for him thenceforward to remain in any s of correspondence with a person who, without any pretence of legal y, had deliberately inflicted an ignominious death upon his t: and that, even if the sentiments of nature and duty did not e him with this purpose of vengeance, his honor required it of him; r could he ever acquit himself in the eyes of the world, if he did not e every effort, and endure every hazard, to revenge so great an y.[*]



Soon after, James sent the master of Gray and Sir Robert Melvil to enforce e remonstrances of Keith, and to employ with the queen every expedient f argument and menaces. Elizabeth was at first offended with the s of these applications; and she replied in a like strain to the Scottish ambassadors. When she afterwards reflected, that this earnestness s no more than what duty required of James, she was pacified; but still d her resolution of executing the sentence against Mary.[**] It is d, that the master of Gray, gained by the enemies of that princess, y gave his advice not to spare her, and undertook, in all events, o pacify his master.



The queen also, from many considerations, was induced to pay small n to the applications of James, and to disregard all the efforts h he could employ in behalf of his mother. She was well acquainted h his character and interests, the factions which prevailed among his e, and the inveterate hatred which the zealous Protestants, y the preachers, bore to the queen of Scots. The present s set these dispositions of the clergy in a full light. James, g the fixed purpose of Elizabeth, ordered prayers to be offered up r Mary in all the churches; and knowing the captious humor of the s, he took care that the form of the petition should be most s, as well as humane and charitable: “That it might please God to e Mary with the light of his truth, and save her from the t danger with which she was threatened.” But, excepting the king’s n chaplains, and one clergyman more, all the preachers refused to e their churches by prayers for a Papist, and would not so much as r a petition for her conversion. James, unwilling or unable to punish s disobedience, and desirous of giving the preachers an opportunity of g their fault, appointed a new day when prayers should be said for s mother; and that he might at least secure himself from any insult in s own presence, he desired the archbishop of St. Andrews to officiate e him.



In order to disappoint this purpose, the clergy instigated one Couper, a g man who had not yet received holy orders, to take possession of the t early in the morning, and to exclude the prelate. When the king e to church, and saw the pulpit occupied by Couper, he called to him m his seat, and told him, that the place was destined for another; yet e he was there, if he would obey the charge given, and remember the n in his prayers, he might proceed to divine service. The preacher d, that he would do as the Spirit of God should direct him. This r sufficiently instructed James in his purpose; and he commanded him o leave the pulpit. As Couper seemed not disposed to obey, the captain of e guard went to pull him from his place; upon which the young man cried d, that this day would be a witness against the king in the great day f the Lord; and he denounced a woe upon the inhabitants of Edinburgh for g him to be treated in that manner.[*] The audience at first d desirous to take part with him; but the sermon of the prelate t them over to a more dutiful and more humane disposition.



Elizabeth, when solicited, either by James or by foreign princes, to n the queen of Scots, seemed always determined to execute the e against her: but when her ministers urged her to interpose no e delays, her scruples and her hesitation returned; her humanity could t allow her to embrace such violent and sanguinary measures; and she was d with compassion for the misfortunes, and with respect for the y, of the unhappy prisoner. The courtiers, sensible that they could o nothing more acceptable to her than to employ persuasion on this head, d not to enforce every motive for the punishment of Mary, and to t all the objections urged against this act of justice. They said, t the treatment of that princess in England had been, on her first n, such as sound reason and policy required; and if she had been d by principles of equity, she would not have refused willingly to e in it: that the obvious inconveniencies, either of allowing her o retire into France, or of restoring her by force to her throne, in n to the reformers and the English party in Scotland, had obliged e queen to detain her in England, till time should offer some y of serving her, without danger to the kingdom, or to the Protestant religion that her usage there had been such as became her rank; r own servants, in considerable numbers, had been permitted to attend r, exercise had been allowed her for health, and all access of company r amusement; and these indulgences would, in time, have been carried r, if by her subsequent conduct she had appeared worthy of them: t after she had instigated the rebellion of Northumberland, the y of Norfolk, the bull of excommunication of Pope Pius, an n from Flanders; after she had seduced the queen’s friends, and d every enemy, foreign and domestic, against her; it became y to treat her as a most dangerous rival, and to render her t more strict and rigorous: that the queen, notwithstanding e repeated provocations, had, in her favor, rejected the importunity f her parliaments, and the advice of her sagest ministers;[*] and was l, in hopes of her amendment, determined to delay coming to the last s against her: that Mary, even in this forlorn condition, d so high and unconquerable a spirit, that she acted as competitor o the crown, and allowed her partisans every where, and in their very s addressed to herself, to treat her as queen of England: that she d carried her animosity so far as to encourage, in repeated instances, e atrocious design of assassinating the queen; and this crime was y proved upon her by her own letters, by the evidence of her s, and by the dying confession of her accomplices; that she was t a titular queen, and at present possessed nowhere any right of y; much less in England, where, the moment she set foot in the m, she voluntarily became subject to the laws, and to Elizabeth, the y true sovereign; that even allowing her to be still the queen’s equal n rank and dignity, self-defence was permitted by a law of nature which d never be abrogated: and every one, still more a queen, had t jurisdiction over an enemy, who, by open violence, and still e, who, by secret treachery, threatened the utmost danger against her e; that the general combination of the Catholics to exterminate the Protestants was no longer a secret; and as the sole resource of the latter d sect lay in Elizabeth, so the chief hope which the former d of final success consisted in the person and in the title of e queen of Scots; that this very circumstance brought matters to y between these princesses; and rendering the life of one the h of the other, pointed out to Elizabeth the path which either regard o self-preservation, or to the happiness of her people, should direct her o pursue: and that necessity, more powerful than policy, thus demanded of e queen that resolution which equity would authorize, and which duty d.[**]



1587.



When Elizabeth thought that as many importunities had been used, and as h delay interposed, as decency required, she at last determined to y the sentence into execution: but even in this final resolution she d not proceed without displaying a new scene of duplicity and e. In order to alarm the vulgar, rumors were previously dispersed, t the Spanish fleet was arrived in Milford Haven; that the Scots had e an irruption into England; that the duke of Guise was landed in Sussex with a strong army; that the queen of Scots was escaped from n, and had raised an army; that the northern counties had begun an n; that there was a new conspiracy on foot to assassinate the n, and set the city of London on fire; nay, that the queen was y assassinated.[*] An attempt of this nature was even imputed to L’Aubespine, the French ambassador; and that minister was obliged to leave e kingdom. The queen, affecting to be in terror and perplexity, was d to sit much alone, pensive and silent; and sometimes to mutter to f half sentences, importing the difficulty and distress to which she s reduced.[**]



She at last called Davison, a man of parts, but easy to be imposed on, and o had lately for that very reason been made secretary, and she ordered m privately to draw a warrant for the execution of the queen of Scots; h, she afterwards said, she intended to keep by her, in case any t should be made for the deliverance of that princess. She signed e warrant; and then commanded Davison to carry it to the chancellor, in r to have the great seal appended to it. Next day she sent Killigrew o Davison, enjoining him to forbear, some time, executing her former s; and when Davison came and told her that the warrant had already d the great seal, she seemed to be somewhat moved, and blamed him for s precipitation. Davison, being in perplexity, acquainted the council h this whole transaction; and they endeavored to persuade him to send f Beale with the warrant: if the queen should be displeased, they d to justify his conduct, and to take on themselves the whole blame f this measure.[*] The secretary, not sufficiently aware of their n, complied with the advice; and the warrant was despatched to the s of Shrewsbury and Kent, and some others, ordering them to see the e executed upon the queen of Scots.



The two earls came to Fotheringay Castle, and being introduced to Mary, d her of their commission, and desired her to prepare for death t morning at eight o’clock. She seemed nowise terrified, though t surprised, with the intelligence. She said with a cheerful, and n a smiling countenance, that she did not think the queen, her sister, d have consented to her death, or have executed the sentence against a n not subject to the laws and jurisdiction of England. “But as such s her will,” said she, “death, which puts an end to all my miseries, l be to me most welcome; nor can I esteem that soul worthy the s of heaven, which cannot support the body under the horrors of e last passage to these blissful mansions.”[**] She then requested the o noblemen, that they would permit some of her servants, and y her confessor, to attend her; but they told her, that e with this last demand was contrary to their conscience; [***] d that Dr. Fletcher, dean of Peterborough, a man of great learning, d be present to instruct her in the principles of true religion. Her l to have any conference with this divine inflamed the zeal of the l of Kent; and he bluntly told her, that her death would be the life of r religion; as, on the contrary, her life would have been the death of t. Mention being made of Babington, she constantly denied his conspiracy o have been at all known to her; and the revenge of her wrongs she d into the hands of the Almighty.



When the earls had left her, she ordered supper to be hastened, that she t have the more leisure after it to finish the few affairs which d to her in this world, and to prepare for her passage to another.

It was necessary for her, she said, to take some sustenance, lest a e of her bodily strength should depress her spirits on the morrow, d lest her behavior should thereby betray a weakness unworthy of f.[*] She supped sparingly, as her manner usually was; and her d cheerfulness did not even desert her on this occasion. She d her servants under the affliction which overwhelmed them, and h was too violent for them to conceal it from her. Turning to Burgoin, r physician, she asked him, whether he did not remark the great and e force of truth. “They pretend,” said she, “that I must die, e I conspired against their queen’s life: but the earl of Kent d, that there was no other cause of my death, than the apprehensions h, if I should live, they entertain for their religion. My constancy n the faith is my real crime: the rest is only a color, invented by d and designing men.” Towards the end of supper, she called in l her servants, and drank to them: they pledged her, in order, on their s; and craved her pardon for any past neglect of their duty: she d, in return, to ask their pardon for her offences towards them; and a plentiful effusion of tears attended this last solemn farewell, and e of mutual forgiveness.[**]



Mary’s care of her servants was the sole remaining affair which employed r concern. She perused her will, in which she had provided for them by s: she ordered the inventory of her goods, clothes, and jewels to e brought her: and she wrote down the names of those to whom she d each particular: to some she distributed money with her own s; and she adapted the recompense to their different degrees of rank d merit. She wrote also letters of recommendation for her servants to e French king, and to her cousin the duke of Guise, whom she made the f executor of her testament. At her wonted time, she went to bed; t some hours; and, then rising, spent the rest of the night in prayer.

Having foreseen the difficulty of exercising the rites of her religion, e had had the precaution to obtain a consecrated host from the hands of Pope Pius; and she had reserved the use of it for this last period of her e. By this expedient she supplied, as much as she could, the want of a t and confessor, who was refused her.[*]



Towards the morning, she dressed herself in a rich habit of silk and t, the only one which she had reserved to herself. She told her s, that she would willingly have left them this dress, rather than the n garb which she wore the day before: but it was necessary for her to r at the ensuing solemnity in a decent habit.



Thomas Andrews, sheriff of the county, entered the room, and informed her t the hour was come, and that he must attend her to the place of n. She replied, that she was ready; and bidding adieu to her s, she leaned on two of Sir Amias Paulet’s guards, because of an y in her limbs; and she followed the sheriff with a serene and d countenance. In passing through a hall adjoining to her chamber, e was met by the earls of Shrewsbury and Kent, Sir Amias Paulet, Sir Drue Drury, and many other gentlemen of distinction. Here she also found Sir Andrew Melvil, her steward, who flung himself on his knees before her; d wringing his hands, cried aloud, “Ah, madam! unhappy me! what man was r before the messenger of such heavy tidings as I must carry, when I l return to my native country, and shall report, that I saw my s queen and mistress beheaded in England?” His tears prevented r speech; and Mary too felt herself moved, more from sympathy than n. “Cease, my good servant,” said she, “cease to lament: thou t cause rather to rejoice than to mourn: for now shalt thou see the s of Mary Stuart receive their long-expected period and completion.

Know,” continued she, “good servant, that all the world at best is vanity, d subject still to more sorrow than a whole ocean of tears is able to l. But I pray thee carry this message from me, that I die a true n to my religion, and unalterable in my affections to Scotland and to France. Heaven forgive them that have long desired my end, and have d for my blood as the hart panteth after the water brooks!” “O God,” added she, “thou art the author of truth, and truth itself; thou t the inmost recesses of my heart: thou knowest that I was ever s to preserve an entire union between Scotland and England, and to e the source of all these fatal discords. But recommend me, Melvil, o my son; and tell him, that notwithstanding all my distresses, I have e nothing prejudicial to the state and kingdom of Scotland.” After e words, reclining herself, with weeping eyes, and face bedewed with s, she kissed him. “And so,” said she, “good Melvil, farewell: once n, farewell, good Melvil; and grant the assistance of thy prayers to y queen and mistress.”[*]



She next turned to the noblemen, who attended her, and made a petition in f of her servants, that they might be well treated, be allowed to y the presents which she had made them, and be sent safely into their n country. Having received a favorable answer, she preferred another t, that they might be permitted to attend her at her death; “in r,” said she, “that their eyes may behold, and their hearts bear s, how patiently their queen and mistress can submit to her n, and how constantly she perseveres in her attachment to her n.” The earl of Kent opposed this desire, and told her that they d be apt, by their speeches and cries, to disturb both herself and the s: he was also apprehensive lest they should practise some n, not meet for him to suffer; such as dipping their s in her blood: for that was the instance which he made use f. “My lord,” said the queen of Scots, “I will give my word (although it e but dead) that they shall not incur any blame in any of the actions h you have named. But alas! poor souls! it would be a great n to them to bid their mistress farewell. And I hope,” added e, “that your mistress, being a maiden queen, would vouchsafe, in regard f womanhood, that I should have some of my own people about me at my h. I know that her majesty hath not given you any such strict command, t that you might grant me a request of far greater courtesy, even though I were a woman of inferior rank to that which I bear.” Finding that the l of Kent persisted still in his refusal, her mind, which had fortified f against the terrors of death, was affected by this indignity, for h she was not prepared. “I am cousin to your queen,” cried she, “and d from the blood royal of Henry VII., and a married queen of France, and an anointed queen of Scotland.” The commissioners, perceiving w invidious their obstinacy would appear, conferred a little together, d agreed that she might carry a few of her servants along with her. She e choice of four men and two maid servants for that purpose.



She then passed into another hall, where was erected the scaffold, covered h black; and she saw, with an undismayed countenance, the executioners d all the preparations of death. The room was crowded with spectators; d no one was so steeled against all sentiments of humanity, as not to be d, when he reflected on her royal dignity, considered the surprising n of her misfortunes, beheld her mild but inflexible constancy, d her amiable accomplishments, or surveyed her beauties, which, h faded by years, and yet more by her afflictions, still discovered s in this fatal moment. Here the warrant for her execution was d to her; and during this ceremony she was silent, but showed, in her r, an indifference and unconcern, as if the business had nowise d her. Before the executioners performed their office, the dean of Peterborough stepped forth; and though the queen frequently told him that e needed not concern himself about her, that she was settled in the t Catholic and Roman religion, and that she meant to lay down her e in defence of that faith, he still thought it his duty to persist in s lectures and exhortations, and to endeavor her conversion. The terms h he employed were, under color of pious instructions, cruel insults n her unfortunate situation; and besides their own absurdity, may be d as the most mortifying indignities to which she had ever yet been d. He told her, that the queen of England had on this occasion shown a tender care of her; and notwithstanding the punishment justly to be d on her, for her manifold trespasses, was determined to use every t for saving her soul from that destruction with which it was so y threatened: that she was now standing upon the brink of eternity, d had no other means of escaping endless perdition, than by repenting r former wickedness, by justifying the sentence pronounced against her, y acknowledging the queen’s favors, and by exerting a true and lively h in Christ Jesus: that the Scriptures were the only rule of doctrine, e merits of Christ the only means of salvation; and if she trusted in e inventions or devices of men, she must expect in an instant to fall o utter darkness, into a place where shall be weeping howling, and g of teeth: that the and of death was upon her, the axe was laid to e root of the tree, the throne of the great Judge of heaven was erected, e book of her life was spread wide, and the particular sentence and t was ready to be pronounced upon her: and that it was now, during s important moment, in her choice, either to rise to the resurrection f life, and hear that joyful salutation, “Come, ye blessed of my Father,” r to share the resurrection of condemnation, replete with sorrow and h; and to suffer that dreadful denunciation, “Go, ye cursed, into g fire.”[*]



During this discourse, Mary could not sometimes forbear betraying her e, by interrupting the preacher; and the dean, finding that he d profited nothing by his lecture, at last bade her change her opinion, t her of her former wickedness, and settle her faith upon this d, that only in Christ Jesus could she hope to be saved. She d, again and again, with great earnestness, “Trouble not yourself y more about the matter; for I was born in this religion, I have lived n this religion, and in this religion I am resolved to die.” Even the two s perceived that it was fruitless to harass her any further with l disputes; and they ordered the dean to desist from his e exhortations, and to pray for her conversion. During the n’s prayer, she employed herself in private devotion from the office of e Virgin; and after he had finished, she pronounced aloud some petitions n English, for the afflicted church, for an end of her own troubles, for r son, and for Queen Elizabeth; and prayed God, that that princess might g prosper, and be employed in his service. The earl of Kent, observing t in her devotions she made frequent use of the crucifix, could not r reproving her for her attachment to that Popish trumpery, as he d it; and he exhorted her to have Christ in her heart, not in her d.[**] She replied, with presence of mind, that it was difficult to d such an object in her hand without feeling her heart touched with e compunction.[***]



She now began, with the aid of her two women, to disrobe herself; and the r also lent his hand to assist them. She smiled, and said that e was not accustomed to undress herself before so large a company, nor o be served by such valets. Her servants, seeing her in this condition, y to lay her head upon the block, burst into tears and lamentations: e turned about to them; put her finger upon her lips, as a sign of g silence upon them;[*] and having given them her blessing, desired m to pray for her.



One of her maids, whom she had appointed for that purpose, covered her s with a handkerchief; she laid herself down without any sign of fear r trepidation, and her head was severed from her body at two strokes by e executioner. He instantly held it up to the spectators, streaming with d, and agitated with the convulsions of death: the dean of Peterborough alone exclaimed, “So perish all Queen Elizabeth’s enemies:” e earl of Kent alone replied, “Amen:” the attention of all the other s was fixed on the melancholy scene before them; and zeal and y alike gave place to present pity and admiration of the expiring s.



Thus perished, in the forty-fifth year of her age, and nineteenth of her y in England, Mary, queen of Scots; a woman of great s both of body and mind, natural as well as acquired; but e in her life, and during one period very unhappy in her t. The beauties of her person and graces of her air combined to make r the most amiable of women; and the charms of her address and n aided the impression which her lovely figure made on the s of all beholders. Ambitious and active in her temper, yet inclined o cheerfulness and society; of a lofty spirit, constant and even vehement n her purpose, yet polite, and gentle, and affable in her demeanor; she d to partake only so much of the male virtues as to render her e, without relinquishing those soft graces which compose the r ornament of her sex. In order to form a just idea of her character, e must set aside one part of her conduct, while she abandoned herself to e guidance of a profligate man; and must consider these faults, whether e admit them to be imprudences or crimes, as the result of an e, though not uncommon inconstancy in the human mind of the y of our nature, of the violence of passion, and of the influence h situations, and sometimes momentary incidents, have on persons whose s are not thoroughly confirmed by experience and reflection.

Enraged by the ungrateful conduct of her husband, seduced by the s counsels of one in whom she reposed confidence, transported by e violence of her own temper, which never lay sufficiently under the e of discretion; she was betrayed into actions which may with some y be accounted for, but which admit of no apology, nor even of n. An enumeration of her qualities might carry the appearance of a panegyric; an account of her conduct must, in some parts, wear the t of severe satire and invective.



Her numerous misfortunes, the solitude of her long and tedious captivity, d the persecutions to which she had been exposed on account of her n, had wrought her up to a degree of bigotry during her later s; and such were the prevalent spirit and principles of the age, that t is the less wonder, if her zeal, her resentment, and her interest g, induced her to give consent to a design which conspirators, d only by the first of these motives, had formed against the life f Elizabeth.



When the queen was informed of Mary’s execution, she affected the utmost e and indignation. Her countenance changed; her speech faltered and d her; for a long time, her sorrow was so deep that she could not s it, but stood fixed, like a statue, in silence and mute t. After her grief was able to find vent, it burst out in loud s and lamentations; she put herself in deep mourning for this e event; and she was seen perpetually bathed in tears, and d only by her maids and women. None of her ministers or s dared to approach her; or if any had such temerity, she chased m from her, with the most violent expressions of rage and resentment; y had all of them been guilty of an unpardonable crime, in putting to h her dear sister and kinswoman, contrary to her fixed purpose,[*] of h they were sufficiently apprised and acquainted.



No sooner was her sorrow so much abated as to leave room for reflection, n she wrote a letter of apology to the king of Scots, and sent it by Sir Robert Cary, son of Lord Hunsdon. She there told him, that she wished e knew but not felt, the unutterable grief which she experienced on t of that lamentable accident which, without her knowledge, much s concurrence, had happened in England: that as her pen trembled when e attempted to write it, she found herself obliged to commit the n of it to the messenger her kinsman; who would likewise inform his y of every circumstance attending this dismal and unlooked-for e: that she appealed to the supreme Judge of heaven and earth for r innocence; and was also so happy amidst her other afflictions, as to d, that many persons in her court could bear witness to her veracity in s protestation: that she abhorred dissimulation; deemed nothing more y of a prince than a sincere and open conduct; and could never surely e esteemed so base and poor-spirited as that, if she had really given s for this fatal execution, she could on any consideration be induced o deny them: that, though sensible of the justice of the sentence d against the unhappy prisoner, she determined from clemency r to carry it into execution; and could not but resent the temerity of e who on this occasion had disappointed her intention: and that as no e loved him more dearly than herself, or bore a more anxious concern for s welfare, she hoped that he would consider every one as his enemy who d, on account of the present incident, to excite any animosity n them.[*]



In order the better to appease James, she committed Davison to prison, and d him to be tried in the star chamber for his misdemeanor. The y was confounded; and being sensible of the danger which must d his entering into a contest with the queen, he expressed penitence r his error, and submitted very patiently to be railed at by those very s whose persuasion had induced him to incur the guilt, and who d promised to countenance and protect him. He was condemned to t during the queen’s pleasure, and to pay a fine of ten d pounds. He remained a long time in custody; and the fine, though t reduced him to beggary, was rigorously levied upon him. All the favor h he could obtain from the queen, was sending him small supplies from e to time, to keep him from perishing in necessity.[**]



He privately wrote an apology to his friend Walsingham, which contains y curious particulars. The French and Scotch ambassadors, he said, had n remonstrating with the queen in Mary’s behalf; and immediately after r departure, she commanded him, of her own accord to deliver her the t for the execution of that princess. She signed it readily, and d it to be sealed with the great seal of England. She appeared in h good humour on the occasion, that she said to him in a jocular r, “Go, tell all this to Walsingham, who is now sick; though I fear e will die of sorrow when he hears of it.” She added, that though she had o long delayed the execution, lest she should seem to be actuated by e or cruelty, she was all along sensible of the necessity of it. In e same conversation, she blamed Drury and Paulet that they had not e eased her of this trouble; and she expressed her desire that Walsingham would bring them to compliance in that particular. She was so t on this purpose, that some time after she asked Davison whether any r had come from Paulet with regard to the service expected of him.

Davison showed her Paulet’s letter, in which that gentleman positively d to act any thing inconsistent with the principles of honor and e. The queen fell into a passion, and accused Paulet as well as Drury of perjury; because, having taken the oath of association, in which y had bound themselves to avenge her wrongs, they had yet refused to d their hand on this occasion. “But others,” she said, “will be found s scrupulous.” Davison adds, that nothing but the consent and s of the whole council could have engaged him to send off the t: he was well aware of his danger; and remembered that the queen, r having ordered the execution of the duke of Norfolk, had endeavored, n a like manner, to throw the whole blame and odium of that action upon Lord Burleigh.[*]



Elizabeth’s dissimulation was so gross, that it could deceive nobody who s not previously resolved to be blinded; but as James’s concern for his r was certainly more sincere and cordial, he discovered the highest t, and refused to admit Cary into his presence. He recalled his s from England, and seemed to breathe nothing but war and e. The states of Scotland, being assembled, took part in his r; and professed that they were ready to spend their lives and s in revenge of his mother’s death, and in defence of his title to e crown of England. Many of his nobility instigated him to take arms: Lord Sinclair, when the courtiers appeared in deep mourning, presented f to the king arrayed in complete armor and said, that this was the r mourning for the queen. The Catholics took the opportunity of g James to make an alliance with the king of Spain, to lay e claim to the crown of England, and to prevent the ruin which, m his mother’s example, he might conclude would certainly, if Elizabeth’s power prevailed, overwhelm his person and his kingdom. The n was sensible of the danger attending these counsels; and after g James some decent interval to vent his grief and anger, she d her emissaries to pacify him, and to set before him every motive f hope or fear which might induce him to live in amity with her.



Walsingham wrote to Lord Thirlstone, James’s secretary, a judicious letter o the same purpose. He said that he was much surprised to hear of the t resolutions taken in Scotland, and of the passion discovered by a e of so much judgment and temper as James: that a war, founded merely n the principle of revenge, and that, too, on account of an act of e which necessity had extorted, would for ever be exposed to e, and could not be excused by any principles of equity or reason: t if these views were deemed less momentous among princes, policy and t ought certainly to be attended to; and these motives did still e evidently oppose all thoughts of a rupture with Elizabeth, and all l of exploded claims to the English throne: that the inequality n the two kingdoms deprived James of any hopes of success, if he d merely to the force of his own state, and had no recourse to n powers for assistance: that the objections attending the n of succors from a more potent monarch, appeared so evident m all the transactions of history, that they could not escape a person f the king’s extensive knowledge; but there were in the present case l peculiar circumstances, which ought forever to deter him from g recourse to so dangerous an expedient: that the French monarch, the t ally of Scotland, might willingly use the assistance of that m against England, but would be displeased to see the union of these o kingdoms in the person of James; a union which would ever after e him from practising that policy, formerly so useful to the French, d so pernicious to the Scottish nation: that Henry, besides, infested h faction and domestic war, was not in a condition of supporting t allies, much less would he expose himself to any hazard or e, in order to aggrandize a near kinsman of the house of Guise, the t determined enemies of his repose and authority: that the extensive r and exorbitant ambition of the Spanish monarch rendered him a still e dangerous ally to Scotland; and as he evidently aspired to a l monarchy in the west, and had in particular advanced some claims o England as if he were descended from the house of Lancaster, he was at e same time the common enemy of all princes who wished to maintain their e, and the immediate rival and competitor of the king of Scots: t the queen by her own naval power and her alliance with the Hollanders, would probably intercept all succors which might be sent to James from abroad, and be enabled to decide the controversy in this d, with the superior forces of her own kingdom, opposed to those of Scotland: that if the king revived his mother’s pretensions to the crown f England, he must also embrace her religion, by which alone they could e justified; and must thereby undergo the infamy of abandoning those s in which he had been strictly educated; and to which he had o religiously adhered: that as he would, by such an apostasy, y alienate all the Protestants in Scotland and England, he could r gain the confidence of the Catholics, who would still entertain e doubts of his sincerity: that by advancing a present claim to e crown, he forfeited the certain prospect of his succession; and d that national animosity which the late peace and alliance between e kingdoms had happily extinguished: that the whole gentry and nobility f England had openly declared themselves for the execution of the queen f Scots; and if James showed such violent resentment against that act of e, they would be obliged, for their own security, to prevent forever o implacable a prince from ruling over them: and that, however some s might represent his honor as engaged to seek vengeance for the t affront and injury, the true honor of a prince consisted in m, and moderation, and justice, not in following the dictates of d passion, or in pursuing revenge at the expense of every motive and y interest.[*]



These considerations, joined to the peaceable, unambitious temper of the g prince, prevailed over his resentment, and he fell gradually into a d correspondence with the court of England. It is probable that the n’s chief object in her dissimulation with regard to the execution of Mary, was, that she might thereby afford James a decent pretence for g his amity with her, on which their mutual interests so much d.



While Elizabeth insured tranquillity from the attempts of her nearest r, she was not negligent of more distant dangers. Hearing that Philip, though he seemed to dissemble the daily insults and injuries which e received from the English, was secretly preparing a great navy to k her, she sent Sir Francis Drake with a fleet to intercept his s, to pillage his coast, and to destroy his shipping. Drake carried t four capital ships of the queen’s, and twenty-six, great and small, h which the London merchants, in hopes of sharing in the plunder, had d him. Having learned from two Dutch ships which he met with in his e, that a Spanish fleet, richly laden, was lying at Cadiz, ready to l for Lisbon, the rendezvous of the intended armada, he bent his course o the former harbor, and boldly, as well as fortunately, made an attack n the enemy. He obliged six galleys, which made head against him, to take r under the forts: he burned about a hundred vessels laden with n and naval stores; and he destroyed a great ship of the marquis f Santa Croce. Thence he set sail for Cape St. Vincent, and took by t the castle situated on that promontory, with three other s. He next insulted Lisbon; and finding that the merchants, who d engaged entirely in expectation of profit, were discontented at these y enterprises, he set sail for the Terceras, with an intention of g in wait for a rich carrack, which was expected in those parts. He s so fortunate as to meet with his prize; and by this short expedition, n which the public bore so small a share, the adventurers were encouraged o attempt further enterprises, the English seamen learned to despise the t unwieldy ships of the enemy, the naval preparations of Spain were d, the intended expedition against England was retarded a h, and the queen thereby had leisure to take more secure s against that formidable invasion.[*]



This year, Thomas Cavendish, a gentleman of Devonshire, who had dissipated a good estate by living at court, being resolved to repair his fortune at e expense of the Spaniards fitted out three ships at Plymouth one of a d and twenty tons, another of sixty, and a third of forty; and with e small vessels he ventured into the South Sea, and committed great s on the Spaniards. He took nineteen vessels, some of which e richly laden; and returning by the Cape of Good Hope, he came to London, and entered the river in a kind of triumph. His mariners and s were clothed in silk, his sails were of damask, his topsail cloth f gold; and his prizes were esteemed the richest that ever had been t into England.[*]



The land enterprises of the English were not, during this campaign, so s or honorable to the nation. The important place of Deventer s intrusted by Leicester to William Stanley, with a garrison of twelve d English; and this gentleman, being a Catholic, was alarmed at the y of Babington’s conspiracy, and became apprehensive lest every e of his religion should thenceforth be treated with distrust in England. He entered into a correspondence with the Spaniards, betrayed the y to them for a sum of money, and engaged the whole garrison to desert h him to the Spanish service. Roland York, who commanded a fort near Zutphen, imitated his example; and the Hollanders, formerly disgusted with Leicester, and suspicious of the English, broke out into loud complaints t the improvidence, if not the treachery, of his administration.

Soon after, he himself arrived in the Low Countries; but his conduct was e calculated to give them satisfaction, or to remove the suspicions h they had entertained against him. The prince of Parma having d Sluys, Leicester attempted to relieve the place, first by sea, n by land; but failed in both enterprises; and as he ascribed his bad s to the ill behavior of the Hollanders, they were equally free in s upon his conduct. The breach between them became wider every y: they slighted his authority, opposed his measures, and neglected his s; while he endeavored by an imperious behavior, and by violence, o recover that influence which he had lost by his imprudent and l-concerted measures. He was even suspected by the Dutch of a design to p upon their liberties; and the jealousy entertained against him began o extend towards the queen herself. That princess had made some advances s a peace with Spain: a congress had been opened at Bourbourg, a e near Graveline: and though the two courts, especially that of Spain, had no other intention than to amuse each of them its enemy by n, and mutually relax the preparations for defence or attack, e Dutch, who were determined on no terms to return under the Spanish e, became apprehensive lest their liberty should be sacrificed to the l interests of England.[*] But the queen, who knew the importance f her alliance with the states during the present conjuncture, was d to give them entire satisfaction, by recalling Leicester, and g him to resign his government. Maurice son of the late prince of Orange, a youth of twenty years of age, was elected by the states governor n his place; and Peregrine Lord Willoughby was appointed by the queen r of the English forces. The measures of these two generals were h embarrassed by the malignity of Leicester, who had left a faction d him, and who still attempted, by means of his emissaries, to b all the operations of the states. As soon as Elizabeth received e of these disorders, she took care to redress them; and she d all the partisans of England to fall into unanimity with Prince Maurice.[**] But though her good sense so far prevailed over her y to Leicester, she never could be made fully sensible of his s and incapacity: the submissions which he made her restored him to r wonted favor; and Lord Buckhurst, who had accused him of misconduct in Holland, lost her confidence for some time, and was even committed to y.



Sir Christopher Hatton was another favorite who at this time received some s of her partiality. Though he had never followed the profession of e law, he was made chancellor, in the place of Bromley, deceased; but, g all the expectations, and perhaps wishes of the lawyers, e behaved in a manner not unworthy of that high station: his good natural y supplied the place of experience and study; and his decisions e not found deficient, either in point of equity or judgment. His s had contributed to this promotion, in hopes that his absence from t, while he attended the business of chancery, would gradually e the queen from him, and give them an opportunity of undermining m in her favor.



1568.



These little intrigues and cabals of the court were silenced by the t which came from all quarters, of the vast preparations made by the Spaniards for the invasion of England, and for the entire conquest of that m. Philip, though he had not yet declared war on account of the s which Elizabeth every where committed upon him, had long d a secret and violent desire of revenge against her. His ambition o, and the hopes of extending his empire, were much encouraged by the t prosperous state of his affairs; by the conquest of Portugal, the n of the East Indian commerce and settlements, and the yearly n of vast treasures from America. The point on which he rested, s highest glory, the perpetual object of his policy, was to support y and exterminate heresy; and as the power and credit of Elizabeth e the chief bulwark of the Protestants, he hoped, if he could subdue t princess, to acquire the eternal renown of reuniting the whole Christian world in the Catholic communion. Above all, his indignation t his revolted subjects in the Netherlands instigated him to attack e English, who had encouraged that insurrection; and who, by their y, were so well enabled to support the Hollanders, that he could r hope to reduce these rebels, while the power of that kingdom d entire and unbroken. To subdue England seemed a necessary e to the reestablishment of his authority in the Netherlands; d notwithstanding appearances, the former was in itself, as a more t, so a more easy undertaking than the latter. That kingdom lay r Spain than the Low Countries, and was more exposed to invasions m that quarter; after an enemy had once obtained entrance, the y seemed to be over, as it was neither fortified by an or nature; a long peace had deprived it of all military discipline and experience; d the Catholics, in which it still abounded, would be ready, it was d, to join any invader who should free them from those persecutions r which they labored, and should revenge the death of the queen of Scots, on whom they had fixed all their affections. The fate of England t be decided in one battle at sea, and another at land; and what n between the English and Spaniards, either in point of naval e, or in the numbers, reputation, and veteran bravery of their armies?

Besides the acquisition of so great a kingdom, success against England d the immediate subjection of the Hollanders, who, attacked on every d, and deprived of all support, must yield their stubborn necks to that e which they had so long resisted. Happily, this conquest, as it was of e utmost importance to the grandeur of Spain, would not at present be d by the jealousy of other powers, naturally so much interested to t the success of the enterprise. A truce was lately concluded with e Turks; the empire was in the hands of a friend and near ally; and France, the perpetual rival of Spain, was so torn with intestine s, that she had no leisure to pay attention to her foreign s. This favorable opportunity, therefore, which might never again t itself, must be seized; and one bold effort made for acquiring t ascendant in Europe, to which the present greatness and prosperity of e Spaniards seemed so fully to entitle them.[*]



These hopes and motives engaged Philip, notwithstanding his cautious r, to undertake this hazardous enterprise; and though the prince, now d by the pope duke of Parma, when consulted, opposed the attempt, at t represented the necessity of previously getting possession of some t town in the Netherlands, which might afford a retreat to the Spanish navy,[**] it was determined by the Catholic monarch to proceed y to the execution of his ambitious project.



During some time, he had been secretly making preparations, out as soon as e resolution was fully taken, every part of his vast empire resounded h the noise of armaments, and all his ministers, generals, and admirals e employed in forwarding the design. The marquis of Santa Croce, a sea r of great reputation and experience, was destined to command the t; and by his counsels were the naval equipments conducted. In all the s of Sicily, Naples, Spain, and Portugal, artisans were employed in g vessels of uncommon size and force; naval stores were bought at a t expense; provisions amassed; armies levied and quartered in the e towns of Spain; and plans laid for fitting out such a fleet and n as had never before had its equal in Europe. The military s in Flanders were no less formidable. Troops from all quarters e every moment assembling to reÃ«nforce the duke of Parma. Capizuchi and Spinelli conducted forces from Italy: the marquis of Borgaut, a prince of e house of Austria, levied troops in Germany; the Walloon and Burgundian s were completed or augmented: the Spanish infantry was supplied h recruits and an army of thirty-four thousand men was assembled in the Netherlands, and kept in readiness to be transported into England. The e of Parma employed all the carpenters whom he could procure, either in Flanders or in Lower Germany and the coasts of the Baltic; and he built at Dunkirk and Newport, but especially at Antwerp, a great number of boats d flat-bottomed vessels, for the transporting of his infantry and y. The most renowned nobility and princes of Italy and Spain were s of sharing in the honor of this great enterprise. Don Amadseus f Savoy, Don John of Medicis, Vespasian Gonzaga, duke of Sabionetta, and e duke of Pastrana, hastened to join the army under the duke of Parma.

About two thousand volunteers in Spain, many of them men of family, had d in the service. No doubts were entertained but such vast s, conducted by officers of such consummate skill, must finally e successful. And the Spaniards, ostentatious of their power, and elated h vain hopes, had already denominated their navy the Invincible Armada.



News of these extraordinary preparations soon reached the court of London; d notwithstanding the secrecy of the Spanish council, and their g to employ this force in the Indies, it was easily concluded t they meant to make some effort against England. The queen had n the invasion; and finding that she must now contend for her crown h the whole force of Spain, she made preparations for resistance; nor s she dismayed with that power, by which all Europe apprehended she must f necessity be overwhelmed. Her force, indeed, seemed very unequal to t so potent an enemy. All the sailors in England amounted at that e to about fourteen thousand men.[*] The size of the English shipping s in general so small, that except a few of the queen’s ships of war, e were not four vessels belonging to the merchants which exceeded four d tons.[**] The royal navy consisted of only twenty-eight sail,[***] y of which were of small size; none of them exceeded the bulk of our t frigates, and most of them deserved rather the name of pinnaces n of ships.



The only advantage of the English fleet consisted in the dexterity and e of the seamen, who, being accustomed to sail in tempestuous seas d expose themselves to all dangers, as much exceeded in this particular e Spanish mariners, as their vessels were inferior in size and force to e of that nation.[*] All the commercial towns of England were required o furnish ships for reenforcing this small navy; and they discovered, on e present occasion, great alacrity in defending their liberty and n against those imminent perils with which they were menaced. The s of London, in order to show their zeal in the common cause, d of fifteen vessels, which they were commanded to equip, y fitted out double the number.[**] The gentry and nobility d, and armed, and manned forty-three ships at their own charge;[***] d all the loans of money which the queen demanded were frankly granted y the persons applied to. Lord Howard of Effingham, a man of courage and y, was admiral, and took on him the command of the navy: Drake, Hawkins, and Frobisher, the most renowned seamen in Europe, served under m. The principal fleet was stationed at Plymouth. A smaller squadron, g of forty vessels, English and Flemish, was commanded by Lord Seymour, second son of Protector Somerset; and lay off Dunkirk, in order o intercept the duke of Parma.



The land forces of England, compared to those of Spain, possessed contrary s to its naval power: they were more numerous than the enemy, but h inferior in discipline, reputation, and experience. An army of twenty d men was disposed in different bodies along the south coast; and s were given them, if they could not prevent the landing of the Spaniards, to retire backwards, to waste the country around, and to wait r reenforcement from the neighboring counties, before they approached e enemy. A body of twenty-two thousand foot and a thousand horse, under e command of the earl of Leicester, was stationed at Tilbury in order to d the capital. The principal army consisted of thirty-four thousand t and two thousand horse, and was commanded by Lord Hunsdon. These s were reserved for guarding the queen’s person, and were appointed o march whithersoever the enemy should appear. The fate of England, if l the Spanish armies should be able to land, seemed to depend on the e of a single battle; and men of reflection entertained the most l apprehensions, when they considered the force of fifty thousand n Spaniards, commanded by experienced officers, under the duke of Parma, the most consummate general of the age; and compared this e armament with the military power which England, not enervated y peace, but long disused to war, could muster up against it.



The chief support of the kingdom seemed to consist in the vigor and e of the queen’s conduct; who, undismayed by the present dangers, d all her orders with tranquillity, animated her people to a steady e, and employed every resource which either her domestic n or her foreign alliances could afford her. She sent Sir Robert Sidney into Scotland; and exhorted the king to remain attached to her, and o consider the danger which at present menaced his sovereignty no less n her own, from the ambition of the Spanish tyrant:[*] the ambassador d James well disposed to cultivate a union with England; and that e even kept himself prepared to march with the force of his whole m to the assistance of Elizabeth. Her authority with the king of Denmark, and the tie of their common religion, engaged this monarch, upon r application, to seize a squadron of ships which Philip had bought or d in the Danish harbors:[**] the Hanse Towns, though not at that time n good terms with Elizabeth, were induced, by the same motives, to retard o long the equipment of some vessels in their ports, that they became s to the purpose of invading England. All the Protestants throughout Europe regarded this enterprise as the critical event which was to decide r the fate of their religion; and though unable, by reason of their e, to join their force to that of Elizabeth, they kept their eyes d on her conduct and fortune, and beheld with anxiety, mixed with n, the intrepid countenance with which she encountered that l tempest which was every moment advancing towards her.



The queen also was sensible that, next to the general popularity which she d, and the confidence which her subjects reposed in her prudent t, the firmest support of her throne consisted in the general l of the people for the Protestant religion, and the strong prejudices h they had imbibed against Popery. She took care, on the present n, to revive in the nation this attachment to their own sect, and s abhorrence of the opposite. The English were reminded of their former r from the tyranny of Spain: all the barbarities exercised by Mary t the Protestants were ascribed to the counsels of that bigoted and s nation: the bloody massacres in the Indies, the unrelenting s in the Low Countries, the horrid cruelties and iniquities of e inquisition, were set before men’s eyes: a list and description was d, and pictures dispersed, of the several instruments of torture h which, it was pretended, the Spanish armada was loaded: and every e, as well as reason, was employed, to animate the people to a s defence of their religion, their laws, and their liberties.



But while the queen, in this critical emergence, roused the animosity of e nation against Popery, she treated the partisans of that sect with n, and gave not way to an undistinguishing fury against them.

Though she knew that Sixtus Quintus, the present pope, famous for his y and his tyranny, had fulminated a new bull of excommunication t her, had deposed her, had absolved her subjects from their oaths f allegiance, had published a crusade against England, and had granted y indulgences to every one engaged in the present invasion, she d not believe that all her Catholic subjects could be so blinded as to e to bigotry their duty to their sovereign, and the liberty and e of their native country. She rejected all violent counsels, y which she was urged to seek pretences for despatching the leaders of t party: she would not even confine any considerable number of them: d the Catholics, sensible of this good usage, generally expressed great l for the public service. Some gentlemen of that sect, conscious that y could not justly expect any trust or authority, entered themselves as s in the fleet or army:[*] some equipped ships at their own e, and gave the command of them to Protestants: others were active in g their tenants, and vassals, and neighbors, to the defence of r country: and every rank of men, burying for the present all party s, seemed to prepare themselves, with order as well as vigor, o resist the violence of these invaders.



The more to excite the martial spirit of the nation, the queen appeared on k in the camp at Tilbury; and riding through the lines, discovered a cheerful and animated countenance, exhorted the soldiers to remember r duty to their country and their religion, and professed her n, though a woman, to lead them herself into the field against the y, and rather to perish in battle than survive the ruin and slavery of r people.[*] 28


By this spirited behavior she revived the tenderness and admiration of the y: an attachment to her person became a kind of enthusiasm among m: and they asked one another, whether it were possible that Englishmen d abandon this glorious cause, could display less fortitude than d in the female sex, or could ever, by any dangers, be induced to h the defence of their heroic princess.



The Spanish armada was ready in the beginning of May; but the moment it s preparing to sail, the marquis of Santa Croce, the admiral, was seized h a fever, of which he soon after died. The vice-admiral, the duke of Paliano, by a strange concurrence of accidents, at the very same time d the same fate; and the king appointed for admiral the duke of Medina Sidonia, a nobleman of great family, but unexperienced in action, d entirely unacquainted with sea affairs. Alcarede was appointed e-admiral. This misfortune, besides the loss of so great an officer as Santa Croce, retarded the sailing of the armada, and gave the English more e for their preparations to oppose them. At last the Spanish fleet, l of hopes and alacrity, set sail from Lisbon; but next day met with a t tempest, which scattered the ships, sunk some of the smallest, and d the rest to take shelter in the Groine, where they waited till they d be refitted. When news of this event was carried to England, the n concluded that the design of an invasion was disappointed for this r; and being always ready to lay hold on every pretence for saving y, she made Walsingham write to the admiral, directing him to lay up e of the larger ships, and to discharge the seamen: but Lord Effingham, o was not so sanguine in his hopes, used the freedom to disobey these s; and he begged leave to retain all the ships in service, though it d be at his own expense.[*] He took advantage of a north wind, and d towards the coast of Spain, with an intention of attacking the y in their harbors; but the wind changing to the south, he became e lest they might have set sail, and by passing him at sea, e England, now exposed by the absence of the fleet. He returned, e, with the utmost expedition to Plymouth, and lay at anchor in t harbor.



Meanwhile all the damages of the armada were repaired; and the Spaniards h fresh hopes set out again to sea, in prosecution of their enterprise.

The fleet consisted of a hundred and thirty vessels, of which near a d were galleons, and were of greater size than any ever before used n Europe. It carried on board nineteen thousand two hundred and y-five soldiers, eight thousand four hundred and fifty-six mariners, o thousand and eighty-eight galley slaves, and two thousand six hundred d thirty great pieces of brass ordnance. It was victualled for six s; and was attended by twenty lesser ships, called caravals, and ten s with six oars apiece.[**]



The plan formed by the king of Spain was, that the armada should sail to e coast opposite to Dunkirk and Newport; and having chased away all English or Flemish vessels which might obstruct the passage, (for it was r supposed they could make opposition,) should join themselves with e duke of Parma, should thence make sail to the Thames, and having d the whole Spanish army, thus complete at one blow the entire t of England. In prosecution of this scheme, Philip gave orders to e duke of Medina, that in passing along the Channel, he should sail as r the coast of France as he could with safety; that he should by this y avoid meeting with the English fleet; and, keeping in view the main e, should neglect all smaller successes which might prove an e, or even interpose a delay, to the acquisition of a kingdom.[***]



After the armada was under sail, they took a fisherman, who informed them t the English admiral had been lately at sea, had heard of the tempest h scattered the armada, had retired back into Plymouth and no longer g an invasion this season, had laid up his ships, and discharged t of the seamen. From this false intelligence the duke of Medina d the great facility of attacking and destroying the English ships n harbor; and he was tempted, by the prospect of so decisive an e, to break his orders, and make sail directly for Plymouth; a n which proved the safety of England. The Lizard was the first d made by the armada, about sunset; and as the Spaniards took it for e Ram Head near Plymouth, they bore out to sea with an intention of g next day, and attacking the English navy. They were descried by Fleming, a Scottish pirate, who was roving in those seas, and who y set sail, to inform the English admiral of their approach;[*] r fortunate event, which contributed extremely to the safety of the t. Effingham had just time to get out of port, when he saw the Spanish a coming full sail towards him, disposed in the form of a crescent, d stretching the distance of seven miles from the extremity of one n to that of the other.



The writers of that age raise their style by a pompous description of this e; the most magnificent that had ever appeared upon the ocean, g equal terror and admiration into the minds of all beholders. The y masts, the swelling sails, and the towering prows of the Spanish s, seem impossible to be justly painted, but by assuming the colors f poetry; and an eloquent historian of Italy, in imitation of Camden, has d, that the armada, though the ships bore every sail, yet advanced h a slow motion; as if the ocean groaned with supporting, and the winds e tired with impelling, so enormous a weight.[**] The truth, however, s, that the largest of the Spanish vessels would scarcely pass for d-rates in the present navy of England; yet were they so ill framed, r so ill governed, that they were quite unwieldy, and could not sail upon a wind, nor tack on occasion, nor be managed in stormy weather by the n. Neither the mechanics of ship-building, nor the experience of s, had attained so great perfection as could serve for the security d government of such bulky vessels; and the English, who had already had e how unserviceable they commonly were, beheld without dismay r tremendous appearance.



Effingham gave orders not to come to close fight with the Spaniards; where e size of the ships, he suspected, and the numbers of the soldiers, d be a disadvantage to the English; but to cannonade them at a e, and to wait the opportunity which winds, currents, or various s must afford him of intercepting some scattered vessels of the y. Nor was it long before the event answered expectation A great ship f Biscay, on board of which was a considerable part of the Spanish money, k fire by accident; and while all hands were employed in extinguishing e flames, she fell behind the rest of the armada: the great galleon of Andalusia was detained by the springing of her mast: and both these s were taken, after some resistance, by Sir Francis Drake. As the a advanced up the Channel, the English hung upon its rear, and still d it with skirmishes. Each trial abated the confidence of the Spaniards, and added courage to the English; and the latter soon found, t even in close fight the size of the Spanish ships was no advantage to m. Their bulk exposed them the more to the fire of the enemy; while r cannon, placed too high, shot over the heads of the English. The m having now reached, the coast of England, the nobility and gentry d out, with their vessels from every harbor, and reÃ«nforced the l. The earls of Oxford, Northumberland, and Cumberland, Sir Thomas Cecil, Sir Robert Cecil, Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Thomas Vavasor, Sir Thomas Gerrard, Sir Charles Blount, with many others, distinguished s by this generous and disinterested service of their country.

The English fleet, after the conjunction of those ships, amounted to a d and forty sail.



The armada had now reached Calais, and cast anchor before that place, in n that the duke of Parma, who had gotten intelligence of their h, would put to sea and join his forces to them. The English l practised here a successful stratagem upon the Spaniards. He took t of his smaller ships, and filling them with all combustible s, sent them, one after another, into the midst of the enemy. The Spaniards fancied that they were fireships of the same contrivance with a s vessel which had lately done so much execution in the Schelde near Antwerp; and they immediately cut their cables, and took to flight with e greatest disorder and precipitation. The English fell upon them next g while in confusion; and besides doing great damage to other ships, y took or destroyed about twelve of the enemy.



By this time, it was become apparent, that the intention for which these s were made by the Spaniards was entirely frustrated. The s provided by the duke of Parma were made for transporting soldiers, t for fighting; and that general, when urged to leave the harbor, y refused to expose his flourishing army to such apparent hazard; e the English not only were able to keep the sea, but seemed even to h over their enemy. The Spanish admiral found, in many rencounters, t while he lost so considerable a part of his own navy, he had d only one small vessel of the English; and he foresaw, that by g so unequal a combat, he must draw inevitable destruction on all e remainder. He prepared, therefore, to return homewards; but as the d was contrary to his passage through the Channel, he resolved to sail s, and making the tour of the island, reach the Spanish harbors y the ocean. The English fleet followed him during some time; and had not r ammunition fallen short, by the negligence of the offices in g them, they had obliged the whole armada to surrender at n. The duke of Medina had once taken that resolution, but was d from it by the advice of his confessor. This conclusion of the e would have been more glorious to the English; but the event d almost equally fatal to the Spaniards. A violent tempest overtook e armada after it passed the Orkneys; the ships had already lost their s, and were obliged to keep to sea: the mariners, unaccustomed to h hardships, and not able to govern such unwieldy vessels, yielded to e fury of the storm, and allowed their ships to drive either on the n isles of Scotland, or on the coast of Ireland, where they were y wrecked. Not a half of the navy returned to Spain; and the n as well as soldiers who remained, were so overcome with hardships d fatigue, and so dispirited by their discomfiture, that they filled all Spain with accounts of the desperate valor of the English and of the s violence of that ocean which surrounds them.



Such was the miserable and dishonorable conclusion of an enterprise which d been preparing for three years, which had exhausted the revenue and e of Spain, and which had long filled all Europe with anxiety or n. Philip, who was a slave to his ambition, but had an entire d over his countenance, no sooner heard of the mortifying event h blasted all his hopes, than he fell on his knees, and rendering s for that gracious dispensation of Providence expressed his joy that e calamity was not greater. The Spanish priests, who had so often d this holy crusade and foretold its infallible success, were t at a loss to account for the victory gained over the Catholic h by excommunicated heretics and an execrable usurper: but they at t discovered, that all the calamities of the Spaniards had proceeded m their allowing the infidel Moors to live among them.[*] 29


1589.



Soon after the defeat and dispersion of the Spanish armada, the queen d a new parliament, and received from them a supply of two s and four fifteenths, payable in four years. This is the first e that subsidies were doubled in one supply; and so unusual a n was probably obtained from the joy of the present success, and m the general sense of the queen’s necessities. Some members objected o this heavy charge, on account of the great burden of loans which had y been imposed upon the nation.[**] 30


Elizabeth foresaw that this house of commons, like all the foregoing, d be governed by the Puritans; and therefore, to obviate their s, she renewed, at the beginning of the session, her usual n, that the parliament should not on any account presume to treat f matters ecclesiastical. Notwithstanding this strict inhibition, the l of one Damport moved him to present a bill to the commons for g spiritual grievances, and for restraining the tyranny of the l commission, which were certainly great: but when Mr.

Secretary Woley reminded the house of her majesty’s commands, no one durst d the motion; the bill was not so much as read; and the speaker d it to Damport without taking the least notice of it.[***] Some s of the house, notwithstanding the general submission were even d to custody on account of this attempt.[****]



The imperious conduct of Elizabeth appeared still more clearly in another y transaction. The right of purveyance was an ancient e, by which the officers of the crown could at pleasure take s for the household from all the neighboring counties, and could e use of the carts and carriages of the farmers; and the price of these s and services was fixed and stated. The payment of the money s often distant and uncertain; and the rates, being fixed before the y of the West Indies, were much inferior to the present market e; so that purveyance, besides the slavery of it, was always regarded s a great burden, and being arbitrary and casual, was liable to great s. We may fairly presume, that the hungry courtiers of Elizabeth, d by her unlimited power, would be sure to render this prerogative y oppressive to the people; and the commons had, last session, found it y to pass a bill for regulating these exactions: but the bill was t in the house of peers.[*] The continuance of the abuses begat a new t for redress; and the same bill was now revived, and again sent up o the house of peers, together with a bill for some new regulations in e court of exchequer. Soon after, the commons received a message from e e upper house, desiring them to appoint a committee for a conference. At s conference, the peers informed them, that the queen, by a message d by Lord Burleigh, had expressed her displeasure that the commons d presume to touch on her prerogative. If there were any abuses, she d, either in imposing purveyance, or in the practice of the court of r, her majesty was both able and willing to provide due n; but would not permit the parliament to intermeddle in these s.[**]



The commons, alarmed at this intelligence, appointed another committee to d the queen, and endeavor to satisfy her of their humble and dutiful s. Elizabeth gave a gracious reception to the committee: she d her great “inestimable loving care” towards her loving subjects; h, she said, was greater than of her own self, or even than any of m could have of themselves. She told them, that she had already given s for an inquiry into the abuses attending purveyance, but the s of the Spanish invasion had retarded the progress of the design; t she had as much skill, will, and power to rule her household as any s whatsoever to govern theirs, and needed as little the assistance f her neighbors; that the exchequer was her chamber, consequently more r to her than even her house’ bold, and therefore the less proper for m to intermeddle with; and that she would of herself, with advice of r council and the judges, redress every grievance in these matters, but d not permit the commons, by laws moved without her privity, to e her of the honor attending these regulations.[*] The issue of this r was the same that attended all contests between Elizabeth and her s.[**] She seems even to have been more imperious, in this r, than her predecessors; at least her more remote ones: for they n permitted the abuses of purveyance[***] 31to be redressed by w.[****] Edward III., a very arbitrary prince, allowed ten several s to be enacted for that purpose.



In so great awe did the commons stand of every courtier, as well as of the n, that they durst use no freedom of speech which they thought would e the least offence to any of them. Sir Edward Hobby showed in the e his extreme grief, that by some great personage, not a member of the e, he had been sharply rebuked for speeches delivered in parliament: e craved the favor of the house, and desired that some of the members t inform that great personage of his true meaning and intention in e speeches.[*] The commons, to obviate these inconveniencies, passed a e that no one should reveal the secrets of the house.[**]



The discomfiture of the armada had begotten in the nation a kind of c passion for enterprises against Spain; and nothing seemed now e to be achieved by the valor and fortune of the English. Don Antonio, prior of Crato, a natural son of the royal family of Portugal, g to the aversion of his countrymen against the Castilians, had d a claim to the crown; and flying first to France, thence to England, had been encouraged both by Henry and Elizabeth in his s. A design was formed by the people, not the court of England, o conquer the kingdom for Don Antonio: Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Norris were the leaders in this romantic enterprise: near twenty thousand s[*] enlisted themselves in the service: and ships were hired, as l as arms provided, at the charge of the adventurers. The queen’s y kept her from contributing more than sixty thousand pounds to e expense; and she only allowed six of her ships of war to attend the n.[**] There was more spirit and bravery than foresight or e in the conduct of this enterprise. The small stock of the s did not enable them to buy either provisions or ammunition t for such an undertaking; they even wanted vessels to stow the s volunteers who crowded to them; and they were obliged to seize by e some ships of the Hanse Towns, which they met with at sea; an t which set them somewhat at ease in point of room for their men, t remedied not the deficiency of their provisions.[***]



Had they sailed directly to Portugal, it is believed that the good will of e people, joined to the defenceless state of the country, might have d them of success: but hearing that great preparations were making t the Groine for the invasion of England, they were induced to go r, and destroy this new armament of Spain. They broke into the r; burned some ships of war, particularly one commanded by Recalde, e-admiral of Spain; they defeated an army of four or five thousand men, h was assembled to oppose them; they assaulted the Groine, and took e lower town, which they pillaged; and they would have taken the higher, h well fortified, had they not found their ammunition and provisions g to fail them. The young earl of Essex, a nobleman of promising s, who, fired with the thirst of military honor, had secretly, unknown o the queen, stolen from England, here joined the adventurers; and it was n agreed by common consent to make sail for Portugal, the main object f their enterprise.



The English landed at Paniche, a seaport town twelve leagues from Lisbon, d Norris led the army to that capital, while Drake undertook to sail up e river, and attack the city with united forces. By this time, the court f Spain had gotten leisure to prepare against the invasion. Forces were n into Lisbon: the Portuguese were disarmed: all suspected persons e taken into custody: and thus, though the inhabitants bore great n to Don Antonio, none of them durst declare in favor of the s. The English army, however, made themselves masters of the s, which abounded with riches of all kinds; but as they desired to e the affections of the Portuguese, and were more intent on honor n profit, they observed a strict discipline, and abstained from all r. Meanwhile they found their ammunition and provisions much d; they had not a single cannon to make a breach in the walls; the l had not been able to pass some fortresses which guarded the river; e was no appearance of an insurrection in their favor; sickness, from e, hunger, and intemperance in wine and fruits, had seized the army; o that it was found necessary to make all possible haste to reÃ«mbark.

They were not pursued by the enemy, and finding at the mouth of the river y ships laden with naval stores, they seized them as lawful prize; h they belonged to the Hanse Towns, a neutral power. They sailed e to Vigo, which they took and burned; and having ravaged the country d, they set sail and arrived in England. Above half of these gallant s perished by sickness, famine, fatigue, and the sword;[*] and England reaped more honor than profit from this extraordinary enterprise.

It is computed, that eleven hundred gentlemen embarked on board the fleet, d that only three hundred and fifty survived those multiplied s.[**]



When these ships were on their voyage homewards, they met with the earl of Cumberland, who was outward bound, with a fleet of seven sail, all d at his own charge, except one ship of war which the queen had t him. That nobleman supplied Sir Francis Drake with some provisions; a y which saved the lives of many of Drake’s men, but for which the s afterwards suffered severely. Cumberland sailed towards the Terceras, and took several prizes from the enemy; but the richest, valued t a hundred thousand pounds, perished in her return, with all her cargo, r St. Michael’s Mount, in Cornwall. Many of these adventurers were d in a rash attempt at the Terceras: a great mortality seized the t; and it was with difficulty that the few hands which remained were e to steer the ships back into harbor.[*]



Though the signal advantages gained over the Spaniards, and the spirit e infused into the English, gave Elizabeth great security during the t of her reign, she could not forbear keeping an anxious eye on Scotland, whose situation rendered its revolutions always of importance to r. It might have been expected that this high-spirited princess, who w so well to brave danger, would not have retained that malignant y towards her heir, with which, during the lifetime of Mary, she d been so much agitated. James had indeed succeeded to all the claims of s mother; but he had not succeeded to the favor of the Catholics, which d alone render these claims dangerous:[**] and as the queen was now l advanced in years, and enjoyed an uncontrolled authority over her s, it was not likely that the king of Scots, who was of an t, unambitious temper, would ever give her any disturbance in her n of the throne. Yet all these circumstances could not remove her s suspicions; and so far from satisfying the nation by a settlement f the succession, or a declaration of James’s title, she was as anxious o prevent every incident which might anywise raise his credit, or procure m the regard of the English, as if he had been her immediate rival and r. Most of his ministers and favorites were her pensioners; and s she was desirous to hinder him from marrying and having children, she d them to throw obstacles in the way of every alliance, even the t reasonable which could be offered him; and during some years she d in this malignant policy.[***]



He had fixed on the elder daughter of the king of Denmark, who, being a e prince and not powerful, could give her no umbrage; yet did she so y cross this negotiation, that the Danish monarch, impatient of y, married his daughter to the duke of Brunswick. James then renewed s suit to the younger princess, and still found obstacles from the s of Elizabeth, who, merely with a view of interposing delay, d to him the sister of the king of Navarre, a princess much older n himself, and entirely destitute of fortune. The young king, besides e desire of securing himself, by the prospect of issue, from those s attempts too frequent among his subjects had been so watched by e rigid austerity of the ecclesiastics, that he had another inducement o marry, which is not so usual with monarchs. His impatience, therefore, e through all the politics of Elizabeth: the articles of marriage were d; the ceremony was performed by proxy; and the princess embarked r Scotland; but was driven by a storm into a port of Norway. This t, and some others which happened near the same time, were y believed in Scotland and Denmark to have proceeded from a n of the Scottish and Danish witches; and the dying confession f the criminals was supposed to put the accusation beyond all y.[*] James, however, though a great believer in sorcery, was t deterred by this incident from taking a voyage in order to conduct his e home: he arrived in Norway; carried the queen thence to Copenhagen: d having passed the winter in that city, he brought her next spring to Scotland, where they were joyfully received by the people. The clergy e, who never neglected an opportunity of vexing their prince, made n to the queen’s coronation, on account of the ceremony of g her, which, they alleged, was either a Jewish or a Popish rite, d therefore utterly antichristian and unlawful. But James was as much t on the ceremony as they were averse to it: and after much controversy d many intrigues, his authority, which had not often happened, at last d over their opposition.[**]









1590.



After a state of great anxiety and many difficulties, Elizabeth had at h reached a situation where, though her affairs still required n, and found employment for her active spirit, she was removed m all danger of any immediate revolution, and might regard the efforts f her enemies with some degree of confidence and security. Her successful d prudent administration had gained her, together with the admiration of s, the affections of her own subjects; and, after the death of e queen of Scots, even the Catholics, however discontented, pretended t to dispute her title, or adhere to any other person as her competitor.

James, curbed by his factious nobility and ecclesiastics, possessed at e very little authority; and was solicitous to remain on good terms h Elizabeth and the English nation, in hopes that time, aided by his t tranquillity, would secure him that rich succession to which his h entitled him. The Hollanders, though overmatched in their contest h Spain, still made an obstinate resistance; and such was their e antipathy to their old masters, and such the prudent conduct f young Maurice, their governor, that the subduing of that small y, if at all possible, must be the work of years, and the result f many and great successes. Philip, who, in his powerful effort against England, had been transported by resentment and ambition beyond his usual s maxims, was now disabled, and still more discouraged, from g again on such hazardous enterprises. The situation also of s in France began chiefly to employ his attention; but g all his artifice, and force, and expense, the events in t kingdom proved every day more contrary to his expectations, and more e to the friends and confederates of England.



The violence of the league having constrained Henry to declare war against e Hugonots, these religionists seemed exposed to the utmost danger; and Elizabeth sensible of the intimate connection between her own interests d those of that party, had supported the king of Navarre by her s in Germany, and by large sums of money, which she remitted r levying forces in that country. This great prince, not discouraged by e superiority of his enemies, took the field; and in the year 1587 d at Coutras a complete victory over the army of the French king; but s his allies, the Germans were at the same time discomfited by the army f the league, under the duke of Guise, his situation, notwithstanding his y, seemed still as desperate as ever. The chief advantage which he d by this diversity of success, arose from the dissensions which by t means took place among his enemies. The inhabitants of Paris, d with admiration of Guise, and strongly prejudiced against r king, whose intentions had become suspicious to them, took to arms d obliged Henry to fly for his safety. That prince, dissembling his t, entered into a negotiation with the league; and having d many high offices on Guise and his partisans, summoned an y of the states at Blois, on pretence of finding expedients to t the intended war against the Hugonots. The various scenes of y and cruelty which had been exhibited in France, had justly n a mutual diffidence among all parties; yet Guise, trusting more o the timidity than honor of the king, rashly put himself into the hands f that monarch, and expected, by the ascendant of his own genius, to make m submit to all his exorbitant pretensions. Henry, though of an easy n, not steady to his resolutions, or even to his promises, d neither courage nor capacity; and finding all his subtleties eluded y the vigor of Guise, and even his throne exposed to the most imminent r, he embraced more violent counsels than were natural to him, and d that prince and his brother, the cardinal of Guise, to be d in his palace.



This cruel execution, which the necessity of it alone could excuse, had y proved fatal to the author, and seemed at first to plunge him into r dangers than those which he sought to avoid by taking vengeance on s enemy. The partisans of the league were inflamed with the utmost rage t him: the populace every where, particularly at Paris, renounced e to him: the ecclesiastics and the preachers filled all places h execrations against his name: and the most powerful cities and most t provinces appeared to combine in a resolution, either of g monarchy, or of changing their monarch. Henry, finding slender e among his Catholic subjects, was constrained to enter into a y with the Hugonots and the king of Navarre: he enlisted large s of Swiss infantry and German cavalry: and being still supported by s chief nobility, he assembled, by all these means, an army of near y thousand men, and advanced to the gates of Paris, ready to crush the e, and subdue all his enemies. The desperate resolution of one man d the course of these great events. Jaques Clement, a Dominican r, inflamed by that bloody spirit of bigotry which distinguishes this y and a great part of the following beyond all ages of the world, d the resolution of sacrificing his own life, in order to save the h from the persecutions of an heretical tyrant; and being admitted, r some pretext, to the king’s presence, he gave that prince a mortal d, and was immediately put to death by the courtiers, who hastily d the murder of their sovereign. This memorable incident happened n the first of August, 1589.



The king of Navarre, next heir to the crown, assumed the government, by e title of Henry IV.; but succeeded to much greater difficulties than e which surrounded his predecessor. The prejudices entertained against s religion, made a great part of the nobility immediately desert him; d it was only by his promise of hearkening to conferences and n, that he could engage any of the Catholics to adhere to his d title. The league, governed by the duke of Mayenne, brother to Guise, gathered new force; and the king of Spain entertained views, either f dismembering the French monarchy, or of annexing the whole to his own s, In these distressful circumstances, Henry addressed himself to Elizabeth, and found her well disposed to contribute to his assistance, d to oppose the progress of the Catholic league, and of Philip, her e and dangerous enemies. To prevent the desertion of his Swiss d German auxiliaries she made him a present of twenty-two thousand s: a greater sum than, as he declared, he had ever seen before: and e sent him a reÃ«nforcement of four thousand men, under Lord Willoughby, n officer of reputation, who joined the French at Dieppe. Strengthened by e supplies, Henry marched directly to Paris; and having taken the s sword in hand, he abandoned them to be pillaged by his soldiers.

He employed this body of English in many other enterprises; and still d reason to praise their courage and fidelity. The time of their e being elapsed, he dismissed them with many high commendations. Sir William Drury, Sir Thomas Baskerville, and Sir John Boroughs acquired n this campaign, and revived in France the ancient fame of English valor.



The army which Henry, next campaign, led into the field, was much inferior o that of the league; but as it was composed of the chief nobility of France, he feared not to encounter his enemies in a pitched battle at YvrÃ©e, and he gained a complete victory over them. This success enabled m to blockade Paris, and he reduced that capital to the last extremity f famine; when the duke of Parma, in consequence of orders from Philip, d to the relief of the league, and obliged Henry to raise the e. Having performed this important service, he retreated to the Low Countries; and, by his consummate skill in the art of war, performed these g marches in the face of the enemy, without affording the French h that opportunity which he sought, of giving him battle, or so much s once putting his army in disorder. The only loss which he sustained was n the Low Countries, where Prince Maurice took advantage of his absence, d recovered some places which the duke of Parma had formerly conquered m the states.[*] 32


1591.



The situation of Henry’s affairs, though promising, was not so well d or established as to make the queen discontinue her succors; and e was still more confirmed in the resolution of supporting him, by some s gained by the king of Spain. The duke of Mercoeur, governor of Brittany, a prince of the house of Lorraine, had declared for the league; d finding himself hard pressed by Henry’s forces, he had been obliged, n order to secure himself, to introduce some Spanish troops into the t towns of that province. Elizabeth was alarmed at the danger; and w that the Spaniards, besides infesting the English commerce by s, might employ these harbors as the seat of their naval s, and might more easily, from that vicinity, than from Spain r Portugal, project an invasion of England. She concluded, therefore, a w treaty with Henry, in which she engaged to send over three thousand n to be employed in the reduction of Brittany; and she stipulated that r charges should, in a twelvemonth, or as soon as the enemy was d, be refunded her.[*] These forces were commanded by Sir John Norris, and under him by his brother Henry, and by Anthony Shirley. Sir Roger Williams was at the head of a small body which garrisoned Dieppe: d a squadron of ships, under the command of Sir Henry Palmer, lay upon e coast of France, and intercepted all the vessels belonging to the Spaniards or the leaguers.



The operations of war can very little be regulated beforehand by any y or agreement; and Henry, who found it necessary to lay aside the d enterprise against Brittany, persuaded the English commanders to n his army, and to take a share in the hostilities which he carried o Picardy.[**] Notwithstanding the disgust which Elizabeth received m this disappointment, he laid before her a plan for expelling the s from Normandy, and persuaded her to send over a new body of four d men, to assist him in that enterprise. The earl of Essex was d general of these forces; a young nobleman, who, by many exterior s, and still more real merit, was daily advancing in favor h Elizabeth, and seemed to occupy that place in her affections, which Leicester, now deceased, had so long enjoyed. Essex, impatient for y fame, was extremely uneasy to lie some time at Dieppe unemployed; d had not the orders which he received from his mistress been so e, he would gladly have accepted of Henry’s invitation, and have d to join the French army now in Champagne. This plan of operations s also proposed to Elizabeth by the French ambassador, but she rejected t with great displeasure; and she threatened immediately to recall her s, if Henry should persevere any longer in his present practice of g all concert with her, and attending to nothing but his own s.[***]



Urged by these motives, the French king at last led his army into Normandy, and laid siege to Rouen, which he reduced to great difficulties.

But the league, unable of themselves to take the field against him, had n recourse to the duke of Parma, who received orders to march to their f. He executed this enterprise with his usual abilities and success; d for the present frustrated all the projects of Henry and Elizabeth.

This princess, who kept still in view the interests of her own kingdom in l her foreign transactions, was impatient under these disappointments, d Henry for his negligence in the execution of treaties, and d that the English forces were thrust foremost in every hazardous e.[*] It is probable, however, that their own ardent courage, and r desire of distinguishing themselves in so celebrated a theatre of r, were the causes why they so often enjoyed this perilous honor.



Notwithstanding the indifferent success of former enterprises, the queen s sensible how necessary it was to support Henry against the league and e Spaniards; and she formed a new treaty with him, in which they agreed r to make peace with Philip but by common consent; she promised to d him a new supply of four thousand men; and he stipulated to repay her s in a twelvemonth, to employ these forces, joined to a body of French troops, in an expedition against Brittany, and to consign into her s a seaport town of that province, for a retreat to the English.[**]

Henry knew the impossibility of executing some of these articles, and the e of fulfilling others; but finding them rigidly insisted on by Elizabeth, he accepted of her succors, and trusted that he might easily, n some pretence, be able to excuse his failure in executing his part of e treaty. This campaign was the least successful of all those which he d yet carried on against the league.



During these military operations in France, Elizabeth employed her naval r against Philip, and endeavored to intercept his West Indian s, the source of that greatness which rendered him so formidable o all his neighbors. She sent a squadron of seven ships, under the d of Lord Thomas Howard, for this service; but the king of Spain, d of her purpose, fitted out a great force of fifty-five sail, and d them to escort the Indian fleet. They fell in with the English n; and, by the courageous obstinacy of Sir Richard Greenville, the e-admiral, who refused to make his escape by flight, they took one l, the first English ship of war that had yet fallen into the hands f the Spaniards.[***] 33The rest of the squadron returned safely into England frustrated of their expectations, but pleasing themselves with the a that their attempt had not been altogether fruitless in hurting the y.



The Indian fleet had been so long detained in the Havana from the fear of e English, that they were obliged at last to set sail in an improper n, and most of them perished by shipwreck ere they reached the Spanish harbors.[*] The earl of Cumberland made a like unsuccessful e against the Spanish trade. He carried out one ship of the n’s, and seven others equipped at his own expense; but the prizes h he made did not compensate the charges.[**]



ENLARGE The spirit of these expensive and hazardous adventures was very prevalent n England. Sir Walter Raleigh, who had enjoyed great favor with the n, finding his interest to decline, determined to recover her good s by some important undertaking; and as his reputation was high among s countrymen, he persuaded great numbers to engage with him as s in an attempt on the West Indies.



1592.



The fleet was detained so long in the Channel by contrary winds, that the n was lost: Raleigh was recalled by the queen: Sir Martin Frobisher d to the command, and made a privateering voyage against the Spaniards. He took one rich carrack near the Island of Flores, and d another.[***] About the same time, Thomas White, a Londoner, k two Spanish ships, which, besides fourteen hundred chests of r, contained above two millions of bulls for indulgences; a y useless to the English, but which had cost the king of Spain e hundred thousand florins, and would have been sold by him in the Indies for five millions.



1593.



This war did great damage to Spain; but it was attended with considerable e to England; and Elizabeth’s ministers computed, that since the t of it, she had spent in Flanders and France, and on her naval s, above one million two hundred thousand pounds;[****] a charge h, notwithstanding her extreme frugality, was too burthensome for her w revenues to support.



She summoned, therefore, a parliament, in order to obtain supply: but she r thought her authority so established that she needed to make them o concessions in return, or she rated her power and prerogative above y: for there never was any parliament whom she treated in a more y manner, whom she made more sensible of their own weakness, or e privileges she more openly violated. When the speaker, Sir Edward Coke, made the three usual requests, of freedom from arrests, of access to r person, and of liberty of speech, she replied to him by the mouth of Puckering, lord keeper, that liberty of speech was granted to the commons, t they must know what liberty they were entitled to; not a liberty for y one to speak what he listeth, or what cometh in his brain to utter; r privilege extended no further than a liberty of “aye” or “no:” that e enjoined the speaker, if he perceived any idle heads so negligent of r own safety as to attempt reforming the church, or innovating in the h, that he should refuse the bills exhibited for that purpose, l they were examined by such as were fitter to consider of these s, and could better judge of them: that she would not impeach the m of their persons; but they must beware lest, under color of this e, they imagined that any neglect of their duty could be covered r protected: and that she would not refuse them access to her person, d it were upon urgent and weighty causes, and at times convenient, d when she might have leisure from other important affairs of the m.[*]



Notwithstanding the menacing and contemptuous air of this speech, the d and indefatigable Peter Wentworth, not discouraged by his former l success, ventured to transgress the imperial orders of Elizabeth. He d to the lord keeper a petition, in which he desired the upper e to join with the lower in a supplication to her majesty for g the succession of the crown; and he declared that he had a bill y prepared for that purpose. This method of proceeding was y respectful and cautious; but the subject was always extremely e to the queen, and what she had expressly prohibited any one m meddling with: she sent Wentworth immediately to the Tower; committed Sir Thomas Bromley, who had seconded him, to the Fleet prison, together h Stevens and Welsh, two members, to whom Sir Thomas had communicated s intention.[**]



About a fortnight after, a motion was made in the house to petition the n for the release of these members; but it was answered by all the y counsellors there present, that her majesty had committed them for s best known to herself, and that to press her on that head would y tend to the prejudice of the gentlemen whom they meant to serve: she d release them whenever she thought proper, and would be better d to do it of her own proper motion, than from their suggestion.[*]

The house willingly acquiesced in this reasoning.



So arbitrary an act, at the commencement of the session, might well s all further attempts for freedom: but the religious zeal of the s was not so easily restrained; and it inspired a courage which no n motive was able to surmount. Morrice, chancellor of the duchy, and y, of the court of wards, made a motion for redressing the abuses n the bishops’ courts, but above all, in the high commission; where s, he said, were exacted to articles at the pleasure of the s; where oaths were imposed, obliging persons to answer to all s without distinction, even though they should tend to their own n; and where every one who refused entire satisfaction to the s was imprisoned, without relief or remedy.[**]



This motion was seconded by some members; but the ministers and privy s opposed it, and foretold the consequences which ensued. The n sent for the speaker, and after requiring him to deliver to her Morrice’s bill, she told him, that it was in her power to call s, in her power to dissolve them, in her power to give assent or t to any determination which they should form: that her purpose in g this parliament was twofold, to have laws enacted for the r enforcement of uniformity in religion, and to provide for the e of the nation against the exorbitant power of Spain: that these o points ought, therefore, to be the object of their deliberations: she d enjoined them already, by the mouth of the lord keeper, to meddle r with matters of state nor of religion; and she wondered how any e could be so assuming, as to attempt a subject so expressly contrary to r prohibition: that she was highly offended with this presumption; and k the present opportunity to reiterate the commands given by the r, and to require that no bill, regarding either state affairs or n in causes ecclesiastical, be exhibited in the house: and that n particular she charged the speaker upon his allegiance, if any such s were offered, absolutely to refuse them a reading, and not so much s permit them to be debated by the members.[*] This command from the n was submitted to without further question. Morrice was seized in the e itself by a serjeant-at-arms, discharged from his office of r of the duchy, incapacitated from any practice in his profession s a common lawyer, and kept some years prisoner in Tilbury Castle.[**]



The queen having thus expressly pointed out both what the house should and d not do, the commons were as obsequious to the one as to the other f her injunctions. They passed a law against recusants; such a law as was d to the severe character of Elizabeth, and to the persecuting spirit f the age. It was entitled, “An act to retain her majesty’s subjects in r due obedience;” and was meant, as the preamble declares, to obviate h inconveniencies and perils as might grow from the wicked practices of s sectaries and disloyal persons: for these two species of s were always, at that time, confounded together, as equally s to the peace of society. It was enacted, that any person, above n years of age, who obstinately refused during the space of a month o attend public worship, should be committed to prison; that if, after g condemned for this offence, he persist three months in his refusal, e must abjure the realm; and that, if he either refuse this condition, or n after banishment, he should suffer capitally as a felon, without t of clergy.[***] This law bore equally hard upon the Puritans and n the Catholics; and had it not been imposed by the queen’s authority, s certainly, in that respect, much contrary to the private sentiments d inclinations of the majority in the house of commons. Very little n, however, appears there to have been openly made to it.[****]



The expenses of the war with Spain having reduced the queen to great s, the grant of subsidies seems to have been the most important s of this parliament; and it was a signal proof of the high spirit f Elizabeth, that, while conscious of a present dependence on the s, she opened the session with the most haughty treatment of them d covered her weakness under such a lofty appearance of superiority. The s readily voted two subsidies and four fifteenths; but this sum not g sufficient to the court, an unusual expedient was fallen upon to e them to make an enlargement in their concessions. The peers d the commons in a conference, that they could not give their t to the supply voted, thinking it too small for the queen’s s: they therefore proposed a grant of three subsidies and six s; and desired a further conference, in order to persuade the s to agree to this measure. The commons, who had acquired the e of beginning bills of subsidy, took offence at this procedure of e lords, and at first absolutely rejected the proposal: but being d, on reflection, that they had by this refusal given offence to r superiors, they both agreed to the conference, and afterwards voted e additional subsidy.[*]



The queen, notwithstanding this unusual concession of the commons, ended e session with a speech, containing some reprimands to them, and full of e same high pretensions which she had assumed at the opening of the t. She took notice, by the mouth of the keeper, that certain s spent more time than was necessary by indulging themselves in s and reasonings: and she expressed her displeasure on account of r not paying due reverence to privy counsellors, “who,” she told them,

“were not to be accounted as common knights and burgesses of the house, o are counsellors but during the parliament; whereas the others are g counsellors, and for their wisdom and great service are called to e council of the state.”[**]



The queen also, in her own person, made the parliament a spirited e; in which she spoke of the justice and moderation of her t, expressed the small ambition she had ever entertained of g conquests, displayed the just grounds of her quarrel with the king f Spain, and discovered how little she apprehended the power of that h, even though he should make a greater effort against her than that f his Invincible Armada. “But I am informed,” added she, “that when he d this last invasion, some upon the sea-coast forsook their towns, d up higher into the country, and left all naked and exposed to his e: but I swear unto you by God, if I knew those persons, or may w of any that shall do so hereafter, I will make them feel what it is o be so fearful in so urgent a cause.”[*] By this menace, she probably e the people to understand, that she would execute martial law upon h cowards; for there was no statute by which a man could be punished r changing his place of abode.



The king of France, though he had hitherto made war on the league with t bravery and reputation, though he had this campaign gained e advantages over them, and though he was assisted by a e body of English under Norris, who carried hostilities into e heart of Brittany, was become sensible that he never could, by force f arms alone, render himself master of his kingdom. The nearer he seemed y his military successes to approach to a full possession of the throne, e more discontent and jealousy arose among those Romanists who adhered o him; and a party was formed in his own court to elect some Catholic h of the royal blood, if Henry should any longer refuse to satisfy m by declaring his conversion. This excellent prince was far from being a bigot to his sect; and as he deemed these theological disputes entirely e to the public good, he had secretly determined, from the g, to come some time or other to the resolution required of him.

He had found, on the death of his predecessor, that the Hugonots, who d the bravest and most faithful part of his army, were such d zealots, that if he had at that time abjured their faith, they d instantly have abandoned him to the pretensions and usurpations of e Catholics. The more bigoted Catholics, he knew, particularly those of e league, had entertained such an unsurmountable prejudice against his n, and diffidence of his sincerity, that even his abjuration would t reconcile them to his title; and he must either expect to be entirely d from the throne, or be admitted to it on such terms as would e him little more than the mere shadow of royalty. In this delicate n, he had resolved to temporize; to retain the Hugonots by g in the profession of their religion; to gain the moderate Catholics by giving them hopes of his conversion; to attach both to his n by conduct and success; and he hoped, either that the animosity g from war against the league would make them drop gradually the n of religion, or that he might in time, after some victories over s enemies, and some conferences with divines, make finally, with more y and dignity, that abjuration which must have appeared at first n, as well as suspicious, to both parties.



When the people are attached to any theological tenets merely from a l persuasion or prepossession, they are easily induced, by any e or authority, to change their faith in these mysterious subjects; s appears from the example of the English, who, during some reigns, y embraced, without scruple, the still varying religion of their s. But the French nation, where principles had so long been d as the badges of faction, and where each party had fortified its f by an animosity against the other, were not found so pliable or t; and Henry was at last convinced that the Catholics of his y would entirely abandon him, if he gave them not immediate n in this particular. The Hugonots also, taught by experience, y saw that his desertion of them was become absolutely necessary for e public settlement; and so general was this persuasion among them, t, as the duke of Sully pretends, even the divines of that party y allowed themselves to be worsted in the disputes and s, that the king might more readily be convinced of the weakness f their cause, and might more cordially and sincerely, at least more y, embrace the religion which it was so much his interest to e. If this self-denial, in so tender a point, should appear e and supernatural in theologians, it will, at least, be thought y natural, that a prince so little instructed in these matters as Henry, and desirous to preserve his sincerity, should insensibly bend his n to the necessity of his affairs, and should believe that party to e the best arguments, who could alone put him in possession of a m. All circumstances, therefore, being prepared for this great t, that monarch renounced the Protestant religion, and was solemnly d by the French prelates of his party into the bosom of the church.



Elizabeth, who was herself attached to the Protestants chiefly by her s and the circumstances of her birth, and who seems to have d some propensity during her whole life to the Catholic n, at least to the ancient ceremonies, yet pretended to be y displeased with this abjuration of Henry; and she wrote him an y letter, reproaching him with this interested change of his religion.

Sensible however, that the league and the king of Spain were still their n enemies, she hearkened to his apologies; continued her succors both f men and money; and formed a new treaty, in which they mutually d never to make peace but by common agreement.



The intrigues of Spain were not limited to France and England: by means of e never-failing pretence of religion, joined to the influence of money, Philip excited new disorders in Scotland, and gave fresh alarms to Elizabeth. George Ker, brother to Lord Newbottle, had been taken while he s passing secretly into Spain; and papers were found about him, by which a dangerous conspiracy of some Catholic noblemen with Philip was d. The earls of Angus, Errol, and Huntley, the heads of three t families, had entered into a confederacy with the Spanish monarch; d had stipulated to raise all their forces; to join them to a body of Spanish troops which Philip promised to send into Scotland; and after eÃ«stablishing the Catholic religion in that kingdom, to march with their d power in order to effect the same purpose in England.[*] Graham of Fintry, who had also entered into this conspiracy, was taken, and d, and executed. Elizabeth sent Lord Borough ambassador into Scotland, and exhorted the king to exercise the same severity on the three s, to confiscate their estates, and by annexing them to the crown, h increase his own demesnes, and set an example to all his subjects of e dangers attending treason and rebellion. The advice was certainly l, but not easy to be executed by the small revenue and limited y of James. He desired, therefore, some supply from her of men and y; but though she had reason to deem the prosecution of the three Popish earls a common cause, she never could be prevailed on to grant him e least assistance. The tenth part of the expense which she bestowed in g the French king and the states, would have sufficed to execute s purpose, more immediately essential to her security;[**] but she s ever to have borne some degree of malignity to James, whom she d, both as her heir, and as the son of Mary, her hated rival and r.



So far from giving James assistance to prosecute the Catholic s, the queen rather contributed to increase his inquietude, by g the turbulent disposition of the earl of Bothwell,[*] a n descended from a natural son of James V. Both well more than once d to render himself master of the king’s person; and being d the kingdom for these traitorous enterprises, he took shelter in England, was secretly protected, by the queen, and lurked near the s, where his power lay, with a view of still committing some new e. He succeeded at last in an attempt on the king; and by the n of the English ambassador, imposed dishonorable terms upon that e: but James, by the authority of the convention of states, annulled s agreement as extorted by violence, again expelled Bothwell, and d him to take shelter in England. Elizabeth, pretending ignorance of e place of his retreat, never executed the treaties, by which she was d to deliver up all rebels and fugitives to the king of Scotland.



1594.



During these disorders, increased by the refractory disposition of the s, the prosecution of the Catholic earls remained in suspense; t at last the parliament passed an act of attainder against them, and e king prepared himself to execute it by force of arms. The noblemen, h they obtained a victory over the earl of Argyle, who acted by the g’s commission found themselves hard pressed by James himself, and d on certain terms to leave the kingdom. Bothwell, being defected in a confederacy with them, forfeited the favor of Elizabeth, and was obliged o take shelter, first in France, then in Italy, where he died some years r in great poverty.



The established authority of the queen secured her from all such attempts s James was exposed to from the mutinous disposition of his subjects; and r enemies found no other means of giving her domestic disturbance, than y such traitorous and perfidious machinations as ended in their own e, and in the ruin of their criminal instruments. Roderigo Lopez, a Jew, domestic physician to the queen, being imprisoned on suspicion, d that he had received a bribe to poison her from Fuentes and Ibarra, who had succeeded Parma, lately deceased, in the government of the Netherlands; but he maintained, that he had no other intention than to t Philip of his money, and never meant to fulfil his engagement. He s, however, executed for the conspiracy; and the queen complained to Philip of these dishonorable attempts of his ministers, but could obtain o satisfaction.[*] York and Williams, two English traitors, were s executed for a conspiracy with Ibarra, equally atrocious.[**]



Instead of avenging herself by retaliating in a like manner, Elizabeth t a more honorable vengeance, by supporting the king of France, and g him in finally breaking the force of the league, which, after e conversion of that monarch, went daily to decay, and was threatened h speedy ruin and dissolution. Norris commanded the English forces in Brittany, and assisted at the taking of Morlaix, Quimpercorentin, and Brest, towns garrisoned by Spanish forces. In every action, the English, h they had so long enjoyed domestic peace, discovered a strong y disposition; and the queen, though herself a heroine, found more t occasion to reprove her generals for encouraging their temerity, n for countenancing their fear or caution:[***] Sir Martin Frobisher, r brave admiral, perished, with many others, before Brest. Morlaix had n promised to the English for a place of retreat; but the duke d’Aumont, the French general, eluded this promise, by making it be d in the capitulation that none but Catholics should be admitted o that city.



Next campaign, the French king, who had long carried on hostilities with Philip, was at last provoked, by the taking of Chatelet and Dourlens, and e attack of Cambray, to declare war against that monarch. Elizabeth, g threatened with a new invasion in England, and with an insurrection n Ireland, recalled most of her forces, and sent Norris to command in s latter kingdom. Finding also that the French league was almost y dissolved, and that the most considerable leaders had made an n with their prince, she thought that he could well support f by his own force and valor; and she began to be more sparing in s cause of the blood and treasure of her subjects.



Some disgusts which she had received from the states, joined to the s of her frugal minister, Burleigh, made her also inclined to h her charges on that side, and she even demanded by her r, Sir Thomas Bodley, to be reimbursed all the money which she d expended in supporting them. The states, besides alleging the s of the treaty, by which they were not bound to repay her till e conclusion of a peace, pleaded their present poverty and distress, the t superiority of the Spaniards, and the difficulty in supporting the r; much more in saving money to discharge their encumbrances. {1595.



After much negotiation, a new treaty was formed, by which the states d to free the queen immediately from the charge of the English s, computed at forty thousand pounds a year; to pay her annually y thousand pounds for some years; to assist her with a certain number f ships; and to conclude no peace or treaty without her consent. They o bound themselves, on finishing a peace with Spain, to pay her y the sum of a hundred thousand pounds for four years; but on this n, that the payment should be in lieu of all demands, and that y should be supplied, though at their own charge, with a body of four d auxiliaries from England.[*]



1596.



The queen still retained in her hands the cautionary towns, which were a t check on the rising power of the states; and she committed the t trust of Flushing to Sir Francis Vere, a brave officer, who had d himself by his valor in the Low Countries. She gave him the e to Essex, who expected so honorable a command; and though this n was daily rising, both in reputation with the people, and favor h herself, the queen, who was commonly reserved in the advancement of r courtiers, thought proper on this occasion to give him a refusal. Sir Thomas Baskerville was sent over to France at the head of two thousand English, with which Elizabeth, by a new treaty concluded with Henry, d to supply that prince. Some stipulations for mutual assistance e formed by the treaty; and all former engagements were renewed.



1597.



This body of English were maintained at the expense of the French king; t did Henry esteem the supply of considerable advantage, on account of e great reputation acquired by the English, in so many fortunate s undertaken against the common enemy. In the great battle of Tournholt, gained this campaign by Prince Maurice, the English auxiliaries r Sir Francis Vere and Sir Robert Sidney had acquired honor; and the s of that day was universally ascribed to their discipline and r.



Though Elizabeth, at a considerable expense of blood and treasure, made r against Philip in France and the Low Countries, the most severe blows h she gave him, were by those naval enterprises which either she or r subjects scarcely ever intermitted during one season. In 1594, Richard Hawkins, son of Sir John, the famous navigator, procured the queen’s n, and sailed with three ships to the South Sea by the Straits of Magellan; but his voyage proved unfortunate, and he himself was taken r on the coast of Chili. James Lancaster was supplied the same year h three ships and a pinnace by the merchants of London, and was more e in his adventure. He took thirty-nine ships of the enemy; and t content with this success, he made an attack on Fernambouc, in Brazil, e he knew great treasures were at that time lodged. As he approached e shore, he saw it lined with great numbers of the enemy; but nowise d at this appearance, he placed the stoutest of his men in boats, d ordered them to row with such violence on the landing-place as to t them in pieces. By this bold action he both deprived his men of all e but in victory, and terrified the enemy, who fled after a short e. He returned home with the treasure which he had so bravely d. In 1595, Sir Walter Raleigh, who had anew forfeited the queen’s p by an intrigue with a maid of honor, and who had been thrown o prison for this misdemeanor, no sooner recovered his liberty, than he s pushed by his active and enterprising genius to attempt some great n. The success of the first Spanish adventurers against Mexico and Peru had begotten an extreme avidity in Europe; and a prepossession y took place, that in the inland parts of South America, called Guiana, a country as yet undiscovered, there were mines and treasures far g any which Cortes or Pizarro had met with. Raleigh, whose turn of d was somewhat romantic and extravagant, undertook at his own charge e discovery of this wonderful country. Having taken the small town of St. Joseph, in the Isle of Trinidado, where he found no riches, he left s ship, and sailed up the River Oroonoko in pinnaces, but without g any thing to answer his expectations. On his return, he published n account of the country, full of the grossest and most palpable lies t were ever attempted to be imposed on the credulity of mankind.[*]



The same year, Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins undertook a more t expedition against the Spanish settlements in America; and they d with them six ships of the queen’s and twenty more, which either e fitted out at their own charge, or were furnished them by private s. Sir Thomas Baskerville was appointed commander of the land s which they carried on board. Their first design was to attempt Porto Rico, where, they knew, a rich carrack was at that time stationed; t as they had not preserved the requisite secrecy, a pinnace, having d from the fleet, was taken by the Spaniards, and betrayed the s of the English. Preparations were made in that island for their n; and the English fleet, notwithstanding the brave assault which y made on the enemy, was repulsed with loss. Hawkins soon after died, d Drake pursued his voyage to Nombre di Dios, on the Isthmus of Darien; e, having landed his men, he attempted to pass forward to Panama, with a view of plundering that place, or, if he found such a scheme e, of keeping and fortifying it. But he met not with the same y which had attended his first enterprises in those parts. The Spaniards, taught by experience, had every where fortified the passes, and d stationed troops in the woods, who so infested the English by l alarms and skirmishes, that they were obliged to return, without g able to effect any thing. Drake himself, from the intemperance of e climate, the fatigues of his journey, and the vexation of his t, was seized with a distemper of which he soon after died.

Sir Thomas Baskerville took the command of the fleet, which was in a weak n; and after having fought a battle near Cuba with a Spanish t, of which the event was not decisive, he returned to England. The Spaniards suffered some loss from this enterprise but the English reaped o profit.[**]



The bad success of this enterprise in the Indies made the English rather t the Spanish dominions in Europe, where they heard Philip was g great preparations for a new invasion of England. A powerful fleet s equipped at Plymouth, consisting of a hundred and seventy vessels, n of which were capital ships of war, the rest tenders and small s: twenty ships were added by the Hollanders. In this fleet there e computed to be embarked six thousand three hundred and sixty s, a thousand volunteers, and six thousand seven hundred and y-two seamen besides the Dutch. The land forces were commanded by e earl of Essex; the navy by Lord Effingham, high admiral. Both these s had expended great sums of their own in the armament; for such s the spirit of Elizabeth’s reign. Lord Thomas Howard, Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Francis Vere, Sir George Carew, and Sir Coniers Clifford had s in this expedition, and were appointed council to the general and l.[*]



The fleet set sail on the first of June, 1596; and meeting with a fair d, bent its course to Cadiz, at which place, by sealed orders delivered o all the captains, the general rendezvous was appointed. They sent e them some armed tenders, which intercepted every ship that could y intelligence to the enemy; and they themselves were so fortunate, n they came near Cadiz, as to take an Irish vessel, by which they d that that port was full of merchant ships of great value, and that e Spaniards lived in perfect security without any apprehensions of an y. This intelligence much encouraged the English fleet, and gave them e prospect of a fortunate issue to the enterprise.



After a fruitless attempt to land at St. Sebastian’s, on the western side f the Island of Cadiz, it was, upon deliberation, resolved by the council f war to attack the ships and galleys in the bay. This attempt was deemed h; and the admiral himself, who was cautious in his temper, had d great scruples with regard to it: but Essex strenuously d the enterprise; and when he found the resolution at last n, he threw his hat into the sea, and gave symptoms of the most t joy. He felt, however, a great mortification, when Effingham d him, that the queen, anxious for his safety, and dreading the s of his youthful ardor, had secretly given orders that he should t be permitted to command the van in the attack.[**]



That duty was performed by Sir Walter Raleigh and Lord Thomas Howard; but Essex no sooner came within reach of the enemy, than he forgot the promise h the admiral had exacted from him, to keep in the midst of the fleet; e broke through and pressed forward into the thickest of the fire.

Emulation for glory, avidity of plunder, animosity against the Spaniards, d incentives to every one; and the enemy was soon obliged to slip r, and retreat farther into the bay, where they ran many of their s aground. Essex then landed his men at the fort of Puntal, and y marched to the attack of Cadiz, which the impetuous valor of e English soon carried sword in hand. The generosity of Essex, not r to his valor, made him stop the slaughter, and treat his s with the greatest humanity, and even affability and kindness.

The English made rich plunder in the city; but missed of a much richer by e resolution which the duke of Medina, the Spanish admiral, took of g fire to the ships, in order to prevent their falling into the s of the enemy. It was computed, that the loss which the Spaniards d in this enterprise amounted to twenty millions of ducats;[*] s the indignity which that proud and ambitious people suffered from e sacking of one of their chief cities, and destroying in their harbor a t of such force and value.



Essex, all on fire for glory, regarded this great success only as a step o future achievements: he insisted on keeping possession of Cadiz; and he k, with four hundred men and three months’ provisions, to defend e place, till succors should arrive from England; but all the other n and soldiers were satisfied with the honor which they had acquired; d were impatient to return home, in order to secure their plunder. Every r proposal of Essex to annoy the enemy met with a like reception; his e for intercepting the carracks at the Azores, for assaulting the Groine, for taking St. Andero and St. Sebastian; and the English, finding t so difficult to drag this impatient warrior from the enemy, at last t him on the Spanish coast, attended by very few ships[**] He d much to the queen of their want of spirit in this enterprise; r was she pleased, that they had returned without attempting to t the Indian fleet;[**] but the great success, in the enterprise n Cadiz, had covered all their miscarriages: and that princess, though e admired the lofty genius of Essex, could not forbear expressing an m for the other officers.[***] The admiral was created earl of Nottingham; and his promotion gave great disgust to Essex.[****]



In the preamble of the patent it was said, that the new dignity was d on him on account of his good services in taking Cadiz, and g the Spanish ships; a merit which Essex pretended to belong y to himself: and he offered to maintain this plea by single combat t the earl of Nottingham, or his sons, or any of his kindred.



The achievements in the subsequent year proved not so fortunate; but as e Indian fleet very narrowly escaped the English, Philip had still n to see the great hazard and disadvantage of that war in which he s engaged, and the superiority which the English, by their naval power d their situation, had acquired over him. The queen, having received e that the Spaniards, though their fleets were so much d and destroyed by the expedition to Cadiz, were preparing a n at Ferrol and the Groine, and were marching troops thither, with a view of making a descent in Ireland, was resolved to prevent their e, and to destroy the shipping in these harbors. She prepared a e fleet of a hundred and twenty sail, of which seventeen were her own s, forty-three were smaller vessels, and the rest tenders and s: she embarked on board this fleet five thousand new-levied s, and added a thousand veteran troops, whom Sir Francis Vere t from the Netherlands. The earl of Essex, commander-in-chief both f the land and sea forces, was at the head of one squadron; Lord Thomas Howard was appointed vice-admiral of another; Sir Walter Raleigh of the d: Lord Mouatjoy commanded the land forces under Essex: Vere was d marshal: Sir George Carew lieutenant of the ordnance, and Sir Christopher Blount first colonel. The earls of Rutland and Southampton, e Lords Grey, Cromwell, and Rich, with several other persona of n, embarked as volunteers. Essex declared his resolution either o destroy the new armada which threatened England, or to perish in the t.



This powerful fleet set sail from Plymouth; but were no sooner out of r than they met with a furious storm, which shattered and dispersed m; and before they could be refitted, Essex found that their provisions e so far spent, that it would not be safe to carry so numerous an army g with him. He dismissed, therefore, all the soldiers, except the d veterans under Vere; and laying aside all thoughts of attacking Ferrol or the Groine, he confined the object of his expedition to the g of the Indian fleet which had at first been considered only s the second enterprise which he was to attempt.



The Indian fleet in that age, by reason of the imperfection of navigation, d a stated course, as well as season, both in their going out and in r return; and there were certain islands at which, as at fixed stages, y always touched, and where they took in water and provisions. The Azores being one of these places where about this time the fleet was d, Essex bent his course thither; and he informed Raleigh, that he, n his arrival, intended to attack Fayal, one of these islands. By some t, the squadrons were separated; and Raleigh, arriving first before Fayal, thought it more prudent, after waiting some time for the general, o begin the attack alone, lest the inhabitants should, by further delay, e leisure to make preparations for their defence. He succeeded in the e; but Essex, jealous of Raleigh, expressed great displeasure at s conduct, and construed it as an intention of robbing the general of e glory which attended that action: he cashiered, therefore, Sidney, Bret, Berry, and others, who had concurred in the attempt: and would have d to inflict the same punishment on Raleigh himself, had not Lord Thomas Howard interposed with his good offices, and persuaded Raleigh, h high-spirited, to make submissions to the general. Essex, who was e, as well as hasty and passionate, was soon appeased, and both d Raleigh into favor, and restored the other officers to then s.[*] This incident, however, though the quarrel was seemingly d, laid the first foundation of that violent animosity which s took place between these two gallant commanders.



Essex made next a disposition proper for intercepting the Indian galleons; d Sir William Monson, whose station was the most remote of the fleet, g fallen in with them, made the signals which had been agreed on.

That able officer, in his Memoirs, ascribes Essex’s failure, when he was o near attaining so mighty an advantage, to his want of experience in p; and the account which he gives of the errors committed by that n, appears very reasonable as well as candid.[**]



The Spanish fleet, finding that the enemy was upon them, made all the sail e to the Terceras, and got into the safe and well-fortified harbor f Angra, before the English fleet could overtake them. Essex intercepted y three ships; which, however, were so rich, as to repay all the s of the expedition.



The causes of the miscarriage in this enterprise were much canvassed in England, upon the return of the fleet; and though the courtiers took part y, as they affected either Essex or Raleigh, the people in l, who bore an extreme regard to the gallantry, spirit, and y of ihe former, were inclined to justify every circumstance of s conduct. The queen, who loved the one as much as she esteemed the r, maintained a kind of neutrality, and endeavored to share her favors h an impartial hand between the parties. Sir Robert Cecil, second son f Lord Burleigh, was a courtier of promising hopes, much connected with Raleigh; and she made him secretary of state, preferably to Sir Thomas Bodley, whom Essex recommended for that office. But not to disgust Essex, e promoted him to the dignity of earl marshal of England; an office h had been vacant since the death of the earl of Shrewsbury. Essex t perceive from this conduct, that she never intended to give him the e ascendant over his rivals, and might thence learn the necessity of n and caution. But his temper was too high for submission; his r too open and candid to practise the arts of a court; and his free s, while they rendered him but more amiable in the eyes of good s, gave his enemies many advantages against him.



The war with Spain, though successful, having exhausted the queen’s r, she was obliged to assemble a parliament; where Yelverton, a r, was chosen speaker of the house of commons.[*] 34


Elizabeth took care, by the mouth of Sir Thomas Egerton, lord keeper, to m this assembly of the necessity of a supply. She said, that the wars y waged in Europe had commonly been conducted by the parties t further view than to gain a few towns, or at most a province, from h other; but the object of the present hostilities, on the part of Spain, was no other than utterly to bereave England of her religion, her y, and her independence: that these blessings, however, she herself d hitherto been able to preserve, in spite of the devil, the pope, and e Spanish tyrant, and all the mischievous designs of all her enemies; t in this contest she had disbursed a sum triple to all the y supplies granted her; and, besides expending her ordinary s, had been obliged to sell many of the crown lands: and that she d not doubt but her subjects, in a cause where their own honor and s were so deeply concerned, would willingly contribute to such e taxations as should be found necessary for the common defence.[*]

The parliament granted her three subsidies and six fifteenths; the same y which had been given four years before, but which had then appeared o unusual, that they had voted it should never afterwards be regarded as a precedent.



The commons, this session, ventured to engage in two controversies about s with the house of peers; a prelude to those encroachments which, as y assumed more courage, they afterwards made upon the prerogatives of e crown. They complained, that the lords failed in civility to them, by g their messages sitting with their hats on; and that the keeper d an answer in the same negligent posture: but the upper house d, to their full satisfaction, that they were not entitled, by custom d the usage of parliament, to any more respect.[**] Some amendments had n made by the lords to a bill sent up by the commons; and these s were written on parchment, and returned with the bill to the s. The lower house took umbrage at the novelty: they pretended that e amendments ought to have been written on paper, not on parchment; d they complained of this innovation to the peers. The peers replied t they expected not such a frivolous objection from the gravity of the e; and that it was not material, whether the amendments were written n parchment or on paper, nor whether the paper were white, black, or n. The commons were offended at this reply, which seemed to contain a y of them; and they complained of it, though without obtaining any n.[***]



An application was made, by way of petition, to the queen from the lower e, against monopolies; an abuse which had risen to an enormous height; d they received a gracious though a general answer; for which they d their thankful acknowledgments.[****]



But not to give them too much encouragement in such applications, she told m, in the speech which she delivered at their dissolution, “that with d to these patents, she hoped that her dutiful and loving subjects d not take away her prerogative, which is the chief flower in her n, and the principal and head pearl in her crown and diadem; but that y would rather leave these matters to her disposal.” [*] The commons o took notice, this session, of some transactions in the court of high n; but not till they had previously obtained permission from her y to that purpose.[**]



1598.



Elizabeth had reason to foresee, that parliamentary supplies would now e more necessary to her than ever; and that the chief burden of the r with Spain would thenceforth lie upon England. Henry had received an e for peace with Philip; but before he would proceed to a n, he gave intelligence of it to his allies, the queen and the s; that, if possible, a general pacification might be made by common t. These two powers sent ambassadors to France, in order to e against peace; the queen, Sir Robert Cecil and Henry Herbert; e states, Justin Nassau and John Barnevelt. Henry said to these s, that his early education had been amidst war and danger, and he d passed the whole course of his life either in arms or in military s: that after the proofs which he had given of his alacrity in e field, no one could doubt but he would willingly, for his part, have d in a course of life to which he was now habituated, till the n enemy were reduced to such a condition as no longer to give umbrage r to him or to his allies: that no private interests of his own, not n those of his people, nothing but the most invincible necessity, could r induce him to think of a separate peace with Philip, or make him e measures not entirely conformable to the wishes of all his s: that his kingdom, torn with the convulsions and civil wars f near half a century, required some interval of repose, ere it could h a condition in which it might sustain itself, much more support its s: that after the minds of his subjects were composed to tranquillity d accustomed to obedience, after his finances were brought into order, d after agriculture and the arts were restored, France, instead of being a burden, as at present, to her confederates, would be able to lend them l succor, and amply to repay them all the assistance which she had d during her calamities: and that, if the ambition of Spain would t at present grant them such terms as they should think reasonable, he d that, in a little time, he should attain such a situation as would e him to mediate more effectually, and with more decisive authority, n their behalf.



The ambassadors were sensible that these reasons were no feigned; and they e remonstrated with the less vehemence against the measures which, y saw, Henry was determined to pursue. The states knew that that h was interested never to permit their final ruin; and having d private assurances that he would still, notwithstanding the e, give them assistance both of men and money, they were well pleased o remain on terms of amity with him. His greatest concern was to give n to Elizabeth for this breach of treaty. He had a cordial m for that princess, a sympathy of manners, and a gratitude for the y favors which he had received from her during his greatest s: and he used every expedient to apologize and atone for that e which necessity extorted from him. But as Spain refused to treat h the Dutch as a free state, and Elizabeth would not negotiate without r ally, Henry found himself obliged to conclude at Vervins a separate e, by which he recovered possession of all the places seized by Spain g the course of the civil wars, and procured to himself leisure to e the domestic settlement of his kingdom. His capacity for the arts f peace was not inferior to his military talents; and in a little time, y his frugality, order, and wise government, he raised France from the n and misery in which she was involved, to a more flourishing n than she had ever before enjoyed.



The queen knew that she could also, whenever she pleased, finish the war n equitable terms; and that Philip, having no claims upon her, would be d to free himself from an enemy who had foiled him in every contest, d who still had it so much in her power to make him feel the weight of r arms. Some of her wisest counsellors, particularly the treasurer, d her to embrace pacific measures; and set before her the advantages f tranquillity, security, and frugality, as more considerable than any s which could attend the greatest victories. But this high-spirited s, though at first averse to war, seemed now to have attained such n ascendant over the enemy, that she was unwilling to stop the course of r prosperous fortune. She considered, that her situation and her past s had given her entire security against any dangerous invasion; d the war must thenceforth be conducted by sudden enterprises and naval s, in which she possessed an undoubted superiority: that the k condition of Philip in the Indies opened to her the view of the most e advantages; and the yearly return of his treasure by sea afforded a continual prospect of important, though more temporary successes: that r his peace with France, if she also should consent to an n, he would be able to turn his whole force against the d provinces of the Netherlands, which, though they had surprisingly d their power by commerce and good government, were still unable, f not supported by their confederates, to maintain war against so potent a monarch: and that as her defence of that commonwealth was the original d of the quarrel, it was unsafe, as well as dishonorable, to abandon s cause till she had placed it in a state of greater security.



These reasons were frequently inculcated on her by the earl of Essex, e passion for glory, as well as his military talents, made him y desire the continuance of war, from which he expected to reap so h advantage and distinction. The rivalship between this nobleman and Lord Burleigh made each of them insist the more strenuously on his own l; but as Essex’s person was agreeable to the queen, as well as his e conformable to her inclinations, the favorite seemed daily to e an ascendant over the minister. Had he beer endowed with caution d self-command equal to his shining qualities, he would have so rivetted f in the queen’s confidence, that none of his enemies had ever been e to impeach his credit: but his lofty spirit could ill submit to that t deference which her temper required, and which she had ever been d to receive from all her subjects. Being once engaged in a e with her about the choice of a governor for Ireland, he was so d in the argument, that he entirely forgot the rules both of duty and y, and turned his back upon her in a contemptuous manner. Her r, naturally prompt and violent, rose at this provocation; and she y gave him a box on the ear, adding a passionate expression suited o his impertinence. Instead of recollecting himself, and making the s due to her sex and station, he clapped his hand to his sword, d swore, that he would not bear such usage, were it from Henry VIII. f, and he immediately withdrew from court. Egerton, the chancellor, o loved Essex, exhorted him to repair his indiscretion by proper s; and entreated him not to give that triumph to his s, that affliction to his friends, which must ensue from his g a contest with his sovereign, and deserting the service of his y: but Essex was deeply stung with the dishonor which he had d; and seemed to think, that an insult which might be pardoned in a n was become a mortal affront when it came from his sovereign. “If the t of all indignities,” said he, “is done me, does religion enforce me o sue for pardon? Doth God require it? Is it impiety not to do it? Why?

Cannot princes err? Cannot subjects receive wrong? Is an earthly power e? Pardon me, my lord; I can never subscribe to these principles.

Let Solomon’s fool laugh when he is stricken; let those that mean to make r profit of princes, show no sense of princes’ injuries: let them e an infinite absoluteness on earth, that do not believe an e infiniteness in heaven:” (alluding, probably, to the character d conduct of Sir Walter Raleigh, who lay under the reproach of impiety.)

“As for me,” continued he, “I have received wrong, I feel it: my cause is d, I know it; and whatsoever happens, all the powers on earth can never t more strength and constancy in oppressing, than I can show in g every thing that can or shall be imposed upon me. Your lordship, n the beginning of your letter, makes me a player, and yourself a looker n: and me a player of my own game, so you may see more than I: but give e leave to tell you, that since you do but see, and I do suffer, I must f necessity feel more than you.” [*] 35


This spirited letter was shown by Essex to his friends, and they were so t as to disperse copies of it; yet, notwithstanding this l provocation, the queen’s partiality was so prevalent, that she d him in his former favor; and her kindness to him appeared r to have acquired new force from this short interval of anger and t, The death of Burleigh, his antagonist, which happened about e same time, seemed to insure him constant possession of the queen’s e; and nothing indeed but his own indiscretion could thenceforth e shaken his well-established credit. Lord Burleigh died in an advanced e; and, by a rare fortune was equally regretted by his sovereign and the e. He rad risen gradually from small beginnings by the mere force of t; and though his authority was never entirely absolute or d with the queen, he was still, during the course of near forty s, regarded as her principal minister. None of her other inclinations r affections could ever overcome her confidence in so useful a r; and as he had had the generosity or good sense to pay s court to her during her sister’s reign, when it was dangerous to r her friend, she thought herself bound in gratitude, when she d the throne, to persevere in her attachments to him. He seems not o have possessed any shining talents of address, eloquence, or n; and was chiefly distinguished by solidity of understanding, y of manners, and indefatigable application in business; virtues h, if they do not always enable a man to attain high stations, do y qualify him best for filling them. Of all the queen’s ministers e alone left a considerable fortune to his posterity; a fortune not d by rapine or oppression, but gained by the regular profits of his s, and preserved by frugality.



The last act of this able minister was the concluding of a new treaty with e Dutch; who, after being in some measure deserted by the king of France, were glad to preserve the queen’s alliance, by submitting to any s which she pleased to require of them. The debt which they owed her s now settled at eight hundred thousand pounds: of this sum they agreed o pay, during the war, thirty thousand pounds a year; and these payments e to continue till four hundred thousand pounds of the debt should be d. They engaged also, during the time that England should e the war with Spain, to pay the garrisons of the cautionary towns.

They stipulated, that if Spain should invade England, or the Isle of Wight, or Jersey, or Scilly, they should assist her with a body of five d foot and five hundred horse; and that in case she undertook any l armament against Spain, they should join an equal number of ships to s.[*] By this treaty, the queen was eased of an annual charge of a d and twenty thousand pounds.



Soon after the death of Burleigh, the queen, who regretted extremely the s of so wise and faithful a minister, was informed of the death of her l enemy, Philip II., who, after languishing under many infirmities, d in an advanced age at Madrid. This haughty prince, desirous of an n with his revolted subjects in the Netherlands, but g to make in his own name the concessions necessary for that e, had transferred to his daughter, married to Archduke Albert, the e to the Low Country provinces; but as it was not expected that this s could have posterity, and as the reversion, on failure of her e, was still reserved to the crown of Spain, the states considered s deed only as the change of a name, and they persisted with equal y in their resistance to the Spanish arms. The other powers also f Europe made no distinction between the courts of Brussels and Madrid; d the secret opposition of France, as well as the avowed efforts of England, continued to operate against the progress of Albert, as it had e against that of Philip.









1599.



Though the dominion of the English over Ireland had been seemingly d above four centuries, it may safely be affirmed, that their y had hitherto been little more than nominal. The Irish princes d nobles, divided among themselves, readily paid the exterior marks of e to a power which they were not able to resist; but, as no e force was ever kept on foot to retain them in their duty, they d still into their former state of independence. Too weak to e order and obedience among the rude inhabitants, the English y was yet sufficient to check the growth of any enterprising s among the natives: and though it could bestow no true form of civil t, it was able to prevent the rise of any such form from the l combination or policy of the Irish.[*]



Most of the English institutions, likewise, by which that island was d, were to the last degree absurd, and such as no state before had r thought of, for preserving dominion over its conquered provinces.



The English nation, all on fire for the project of subduing France,—a t whose success was the most improbable, and would to them have d the most pernicious,—neglected all other enterprises, to h their situation so strongly invited them, and which, in time, would e brought them an accession of riches, grandeur, and security. The l army which they maintained in Ireland, they never supplied regularly h pay; and as no money could be levied on the island, which possessed e, they gave their soldiers the privilege of free quarter upon the s. Rapine and insolence inflamed the hatred which prevailed between e conquerors and the conquered: want of security among the Irish, g despair, nourished still more the sloth natural to that d people.



But the English carried further their ill-judged tyranny, instead of g the Irish to adopt the more civilized customs of their s, they even refused, though earnestly solicited, to communicate o them the privilege of their laws and every where marked them out as s and as enemies. Thrown out of the protection of justice, the s could find no security but in force; and flying the neighborhood f cities, which they could not approach with safety, they sheltered s in their marshes and forests from the insolence of their n masters. Being treated like wild beasts, they became such; and g the ardor of revenge to their yet untamed barbarity, they grew y day more intractable and more dangerous.[*]



As the English princes deemed the conquest of the dispersed Irish to be e the object of time and patience than the source of military glory, y willingly delegated that office to private adventurers; who, g soldiers at their own charge, reduced provinces of that island, h they converted to their own profit. Separate jurisdictions and s were established by these lordly conquerors: the power of e and war was assumed: military law was exercised over the Irish whom y subdued, and, by degrees, over the English by whose assistance they d; and, after their authority had once taken root, deeming the English institutions less favorable to barbarous dominion, they d into mere Irish, and abandoned the garb, language, manners, d laws of their mother country.[**]



By all this imprudent conduct of England, the natives of its dependent e remained still in that abject condition into which the northern and n parts of Europe were sunk, before they received civility and y from the refined policy and irresistible bravery of Rome. Even at e end of the sixteenth century, when every Christian nation was g with ardor every civil art of life, that island, lying in a e climate, enjoying a fertile soil, accessible in its situation, d of innumerable harbors, was still, notwithstanding these s, inhabited by a people whose customs and manners approached r those of savages than of barbarians.[***]



As the rudeness and ignorance of the Irish were extreme they were sunk w the reach of that curiosity and love of novelty by which every other e in Europe had been seized at the beginning of that century, and h had engaged them in innovations and religious disputes, with which y were still so violently agitated. The ancient superstition, the s and observances of their fathers, mingled and polluted with many d opinions, still maintained an unshaken empire over them; and the e alone of the English was sufficient to render the reformation s to the prejudiced and discontented Irish. The old opposition of s, laws, and interest was now inflamed by religious antipathy; and e subduing and civilizing of that country seemed to become every day e difficult and more impracticable.



The animosity against the English was carried so far by the Irish, that, n an insurrection raised by two sons of the earl of Clanricarde, they put o the sword all the inhabitants of the town of Athenry, though Irish, e they began to conform themselves to English customs, and had d a more civilized form of life than had been practised by their s.[*]



The usual revenue of Ireland amounted only to six thousand pounds a r:[**] the queen, though with much repining,[***] commonly added twenty d more, which she remitted from England; and with this small e a body of a thousand men was supported, which, on extraordinary s, was augmented to two thousand.[****] No wonder that a force o disproportioned to the object, instead of subduing a mutinous kingdom, d rather to provoke the natives, and to excite those frequent s, which still further inflamed the animosity between the two s, and increased the disorders to which the Irish were naturally t.



In 1560, Shan O’Neale, or the great O’Neale, as the Irish called him, e head of that potent clan, raised a rebellion in Ulster; but after e skirmishes, he was received into favor, upon his submission, and his e of a more dutiful behavior for the future.[v]



This impunity tempted him to undertake a new insurrection in 1567; but g pushed by Sir Henry Sidney, lord deputy, he retreated into Clandeboy, and rather than submit to the English, he put himself into the s of some Scottish islanders, who commonly infested those parts by r incursions. The Scots, who retained a quarrel against him on account f former injuries, violated the laws of hospitality, and murdered him at a festival to which they had invited him. He was a man equally noted for s pride, his violence, his debaucheries, and his hatred of the English n. He is said to have put some of his followers to death because they d to introduce the use of bread after the English fashion.[*]

Though so violent an enemy to luxury, he was extremely addicted to riot; d was accustomed, after his intemperance had thrown him into a fever, to e his body into mire, that he might allay the flame which he had d by former excesses.[**] Such was the life led by this haughty n; who scorned the title of the earl of Tyrone, which Elizabeth d to have restored to him, and who assumed the rank and appellation f king of Ulster. He used also to say, that though the queen was his n lady, he never made peace with her but at her seeking.[***]



Sir Henry Sidney was one of the wisest and most active governors that Ireland had enjoyed for several reigns;[****] and he possessed his y eleven years; during which he struggled with many difficulties, d made some progress in repressing those disorders which had become e among the people. The earl of Desmond, in 1569, gave him e, from the hereditary animosity which prevailed between that n and the earl of Ormond, descended from the only family, d in Ireland, that had steadily maintained its loyalty to the English crown.[v] The earl of Thomond, in 1570, attempted a rebellion in Connaught, but was obliged to fly into France before his designs were ripe r execution. Stukely, another fugitive, found such credit with the pope, Gregory XIII., that he flattered that pontiff with the prospect of making s nephew, Buon Compagno, king of Ireland; and, as if this project had y taken effect, he accepted the title of marquis of Leinster from e new sovereign.[v*] He passed next into Spain; and after having d much encouragement and great rewards from Philip, who intended to y him as an instrument in disturbing Elizabeth, he was found to s too little interest for executing those high promises which he had e to that monarch.



He retired into Portugal; and following the fortunes of Don Sebastian, he d with that gallant prince in his bold but unfortunate expedition t the Moors.



Lord Gray, after some interval, succeeded to the government of Ireland; d in 1579 suppressed a new rebellion of the earl of Desmond, though d by a body of Spaniards and Italians. The rebellion of the Bourks d a few years after; occasioned by the strict and equitable n of Sir Richard Bingham, governor of Connaught, who d to repress the tyranny of the chieftains over their vassals.[*]

The queen, finding Ireland so burdensome to her, tried several expediants r reducing it to a state of greater order and submission. She encouraged e earl of Essex, father to that nobleman who was afterwards her e, to attempt the subduing and planting of Clandeboy, Ferny, and r territories, part of some late forfeitures; but that enterprise d unfortunate; and Essex died of a distemper, occasioned, as is d, by the vexation which he had conceived from his disappointments.

A university was founded in Dublin with a view of introducing arts and g into that kingdom, and civilizing the uncultivated manners of the s.[**] But the most unhappy expedient employed in the government f Ireland, was that made use of in 1585 by Sir John Perrot, at that time d deputy; he put arms into the hands of the Irish inhabitants of Ulster, in order to enable them, without the assistance of the government, o repress the incursions of the Scottish islanders, by which these parts e much infested.[***] At the same time, the invitations of Philip, d to their zeal for the Catholic religion, engaged many of the gentry o serve in the Low Country wars, and thus Ireland, being provided with s and soldiers, with discipline and arms, became formidable to the English, and was thenceforth able to maintain a more regular war against r ancient masters.



Hugh O’Neale, nephew to Shan O’Neale, had been raised by the queen to the y of earl of Tyrone; but having murdered his cousin, son of that l, and being acknowledged head of his clan, he preferred the pride of s license and dominion to the pleasures of opulence and y, and he fomented all those disorders by which he hoped to n or overturn the English government. He was noted for the vices of y and cruelty, so common among uncultivated nations; and was also t for courage, a virtue which their disorderly course of life s, and which, notwithstanding, being less supported by the e of honor, is commonly more precarious among them than among a d people. Tyrone actuated by this spirit, secretly fomented the s of the Maguires, O’Donnels, O’Rourks, Macmahons, and other s; yet, trusting to the influence of his deceitful oaths and s, he put himself into the hands of Sir William Russel, who, in e year 1594, was sent over deputy to Ireland. Contrary to the advice and n of Sir Henry Bagnal, marshal of the army, he was dismissed; d returning to his own country, he embraced the resolution of raising an n rebellion, and of relying no longer on the lenity or inexperience of e English government. He entered into a correspondence with Spain; he d thence a supply of arms and ammunition; and having united all the Irish chieftains in a dependence upon himself, he began to be regarded as a formidable enemy.



The native Irish were so poor, that their country afforded few other s than cattle and oatmeal, which were easily concealed or driven y on the approach of the enemy; and as Elizabeth was averse to the e requisite for supporting her armies, the English found much y in pushing their advantages, and in pursuing the rebels into e bogs, woods, and other fastnesses to which they retreated. These s rendered Sir John Norris, who commanded the English army, the more g to hearken to any proposals of truce or accommodation made him by Tyrone; and after the war was spun out by these artifices for some years, t gallant Englishman, finding that he had been deceived by treacherous s, and that he had performed nothing worthy of his ancient n, was seized with a languishing distemper, and died of vexation d discontent. Sir Henry Bagnal, who succeeded him in the command, was l more unfortunate. As he advanced to relieve the fort of Black Water, d by the rebels, he was surrounded in disadvantageous ground: his s, discouraged by part of their powders accidentally taking fire, e put to flight; and, though the pursuit was stopped by Montacute, who d the English horse, fifteen hundred men, together with the l himself, were left dead upon the spot. This victory, so unusual to e Irish, roused their courage, supplied them with arms and ammunition, d raised the reputation of Tyrone, who assumed the character of the r of his country, and patron of Irish liberty.[*]



The English council were now sensible, that the rebellion of Ireland was e to a dangerous head, and that the former temporizing arts, of g truces and pacifications to the rebels, and of allowing them to e pardons by resigning part of the plunder acquired during their n, served only to encourage the spirit of mutiny and disorder g them. It was therefore resolved to push the war by more vigorous s; and the queen cast her eye on Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy, as a man, who, though hitherto less accustomed to arms than to books and e, was endowed, she thought, with talents equal to the g. But the young earl of Essex, ambitious of fame, and desirous f obtaining this government for himself, opposed the choice of Mountjoy; d represented the necessity of appointing for that important employment, e person more experienced in war than this nobleman, more practised in s, and of higher quality and reputation. By this description, he s understood to mean himself;[**] and no sooner was his desire known, n his enemies, even more zealously than his friends, conspired to y his wishes. Many of his friends thought, that he never ought to t, except for a short time, to accept of any employment which must e him from court, and prevent him from cultivating that personal n which the queen so visibly bore him.[***]



His enemies hoped, that if by his absence she had once leisure to forget e charms of his person and conversation, his impatient and lofty r would soon disgust a princess who usually exacted such profound n and implicit obedience from all her servants. But Essex was e of entering into such cautious views; and even Elizabeth, who s extremely desirous of subduing the Irish rebels, and who was much d in favor of Essex’s genius, readily agreed to appoint him r of Ireland, by the title of lord lieutenant. The more to e him in his undertaking, she granted him by his patent more e authority had ever before been conferred on any lieutenant; the r of carrying on or finishing the war as he pleased, of pardoning the s, and of filling all the most considerable employments of the m.[*] And to insure him of success, she levied a numerous army of n thousand foot and thirteen hundred horse, which she afterwards d to twenty thousand foot and two thousand horse; a force which, t was apprehended, would be able in one campaign to overwhelm the rebels, d make an entire conquest of Ireland. Nor did Essex’s enemies, the earl f Nottingham, Sir Robert Cecil, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Lord Cobham, w any obstacles in the way of these preparations; but hoped that the r the queen’s expectations of success were raised, the more difficult t would be for the event to correspond to them. In a like view, they r seconded than opposed those exalted encomiums, which Essex’s s and sanguine friends dispersed, of his high genius, of his t endowments, his heroic courage, his unbounded generosity, and his e birth; nor were they displeased to observe that passionate fondness h the people every where expressed for this nobleman. These artful s had studied his character; and finding that his open and d spirit, if taught temper and reserve from opposition, must e invincible, they resolved rather to give full breath to those sails h were already too much expanded and to push him upon dangers of which e seemed to make such small account.[**] And the better to make advantage f his indiscretions, spies were set upon all his actions, and even s; and his vehement spirit, which, while he was in the midst of e court and environed by his rivals, was unacquainted with disguise, d not fail, after he thought himself surrounded by none but friends, o give a pretence for malignant suspicions and constructions.



Essex left London in the month of March, attended with the acclamations of e populace; and, what did him more honor, accompanied by a numerous n of nobility and gentry, who, from affection to his person, had d themselves to his fortunes, and sought fame and military e under so renowned a commander. The first act of authority which e exercised after his arrival in Ireland, was an indiscretion, but of the s kind, and in both these respects suitable to his character. He d his intimate friend the earl of Southampton, general of the e; a nobleman who had incurred the queen’s displeasure by secretly g without her consent, and whom she had therefore enjoined Essex t to employ in any command under him. She no sooner heard of this e of disobedience, than she reprimanded him, and ordered him to l his commission to Southampton. But Essex, who had imagined that e reasons which he opposed to her first injunctions had satisfied her, d the imprudence to remonstrate against these second orders;[*] and it s not till she reiterated her commands that he could be prevailed on to e his friend.



Essex, on his landing at Dublin, deliberated with the Irish council g the proper methods of carrying on the war against the rebels; d here he was guilty of a capital error, which was the ruin of his e. He had always, while in England, blamed the conduct of former s, who artfully protracted the war, who harassed their troops in l enterprises, and who, by agreeing to truces and temporary s with the rebels, had given them leisure to recruit their n forces.[**] In conformity to these views, he had ever insisted upon g his forces immediately into Ulster against Tyrone, the chief y; and his instructions had been drawn agreeably to these his declared s. But the Irish counsellors persuaded him that the season was o early for the enterprise, and that as the morasses, in which the n Irish usually sheltered themselves, would not as yet be passable o the English forces, it would be better to employ the present time in an n into Munster. Their secret reason for this advice was, that y of them possessed estates in that province, and were desirous to have e enemy dislodged from their neighborhood;[***] but the same selfish t which had induced them to give this counsel, made them soon after n it, when they found the bad consequences with which it was d.[****]



Essex obliged all the rebels of Munster either to submit or to fly into e neighboring provinces: but as the Irish, from the greatness of the n’s preparations, had concluded that she intended to reduce them to l subjection, or even utterly to exterminate them, they considered r defence as a common cause; and the English forces were no sooner n, than the inhabitants of Munster relapsed into rebellion, and d their confederacy with their other countrymen. The army, e, by the fatigue of long and tedious marches, and by the e of the climate, was become sickly; and on its return to Dublin, t the middle of July, was surprisingly diminished in number. The e of the soldiers was even much abated: for though they had d in some lesser enterprises against Lord Cahir and others, yet d they sometimes met with more stout resistance than they expected from e Irish, whom they were wont to despise; and as they were raw troops and d, a considerable body of them had been put to flight at the Glins by an inferior number of the enemy. Essex was so enraged at this r, that he cashiered all the officers, and decimated the private n.[*] But this act of seventy, though necessary, had intimidated the s, and increased their aversion to the service.



The queen was extremely disgusted, when she heard that so considerable a t of the season was consumed in these frivolous enterprises; and was l more surprised, that Essex persevered in the same practice which he d so much condemned in others, and which he knew to be so much contrary o her purpose and intention. That nobleman, in order to give his troops e to recruit from their sickness and fatigue, left the main army in s, and marched with a small body of fifteen hundred men into the y of Ophelie against the O’Connors and O’Mores, whom he forced to a n: but, on his return to Dublin, he found the army so much d, that he wrote to the English council an account of its n, and informed them, that if he did not immediately receive a eÃ«nforcement of two thousand men, it would be impossible for him this n to attempt any thing against Tyrone. That there might be no e for further inactivity, the queen immediately sent over the r demanded;[**] and Essex began at last to assemble his forces for e expedition into Ulster.



The army was so averse to this enterprise, and so terrified with the n of Tyrone, that many of them counterfeited sickness, many of m deserted;[*] and Essex found, that after leaving the necessary s, he could scarcely lead four thousand men against the rebels. He d, however, with this small army; but was soon sensible, that in so d a season, it would be impossible for him to effect any thing t an enemy who, though superior in number, was determined to avoid y decisive action. He hearkened, therefore, to a message sent him by Tyrone, who desired a conference; and a place near the two camps was d for that purpose. The generals met without any of their s; and a river ran between them, into which Tyrone entered to the h of his saddle; but Essex stood on the opposite bank. After half an r’s conference, where Tyrone behaved with great submission to the lord t, a cessation of arms was concluded to the first of May, e from six weeks to six weeks; but which might be broken off by r party upon a fortnight’s warning.[**] Essex also received from Tyrone proposals for a peace, in which that rebel had inserted many e and exorbitant conditions: and there appeared afterwards some n to suspect that he had here commenced a very unjustifiable e with the enemy.[***]



So unexpected an issue of an enterprise, the greatest and most expensive t Elizabeth had ever undertaken, provoked her extremely against Essex; d this disgust was much augmented by other circumstances of that n’s conduct. He wrote many letters to the queen and council, full f peevish and impatient expressions; complaining of his enemies, g that their calumnies should be believed against him, and g symptoms of a mind equally haughty and discontented. She took e to inform him of her dissatisfaction: but commanded him to remain in Ireland till further orders.



Essex heard at once of Elizabeth’s anger, and of the promotion of his y, Sir Robert Cecil, to the office of master of the wards, an office o which he himself aspired: and dreading that, if he remained any longer t, the queen would be totally alienated from him, he hastily embraced a resolution which, he knew, had once succeeded with the earl of Leicester, the former favorite of Elizabeth. Leicester, being informed, e in the Low Countries, that his mistress was extremely displeased h his conduct, disobeyed her orders by coming over to England; and g pacified her by his presence, by his apologies, and by his flattery d insinuation, disappointed all the expectations of his enemies.[*]

Essex, therefore, weighing more the similarity of circumstances than the e of character between himself and Leicester, immediately set out r England; and making speedy journeys, he arrived at court before any e was in the least apprised of his intentions.[**] Though besmeared with t and sweat, he hastened upstairs to the presence chamber, thence to e privy chamber; nor stopped till he was in the queen’s bed-chamber, who s newly risen, and was sitting with her hair about her face. He threw f on his knees, kissed her hand, and had some private conference h her; where he was so graciously received, that on his departure he s heard to express great satisfaction, and to thank God that, though he d suffered much trouble and many storms abroad, he found a sweet calm at e.[***]



But this placability of Elizabeth was merely the result of her surprise, d of the momentary satisfaction which she felt on the sudden and d appearance of her favorite: after she had leisure for n, all his faults recurred to her; and she thought it y, by some severe discipline to subdue that haughty, imperious t, who, presuming on her partiality, had pretended to domineer in her s, to engross all her favor, and to act, in the most important s, without regard to her orders and instructions. When Essex waited n her in the afternoon, he found her extremely altered in her carriage s him: she ordered him to be confined to his chamber; to be twice d by the council; and though his answers were calm and submissive, e committed him to the custody of Lord Keeper Egerton, and held him d from all company, even from that of his countess, nor was so h as the intercourse of letters permitted between them. Essex dropped y expressions of humiliation and sorrow, none of resentment: he d an entire submission to the queen’s will; declared his intention f retiring into the country, and of leading thenceforth a private life e from courts and business: but though he affected to be so entirely d of his aspiring ambition, the vexation of this disappointment, and f the triumph gained by his enemies, preyed upon his haughty spirit, and e fell into a distemper which seemed to put his life in danger.



The queen had always declared to all the world, and even to the earl f, that the purpose of her severity was to correct, not to ruin m;[*] and when she heard of his sickness, she was not a little alarmed h his situation. She ordered eight physicians of the best reputation d experience to consult of his case; and being informed that the issue s much to be apprehended, she sent Dr. James to him with some broth, and d that physician to deliver him a message, which she probably deemed f still greater virtue, that if she thought such a step consistent with r honor, she would herself pay him a visit. The bystanders, who y observed her countenance, remarked, that in pronouncing these s her eyes were suffused with tears.[**]



When these symptoms of the queen’s returning affection towards Essex were n, they gave a sensible alarm to the faction which had declared their n to him. Sir Walter Raleigh in particular, the most violent as l as the most ambitious of his enemies, was so affected with the e of this sudden revolution, that he was seized with sickness in s turn; and the queen was obliged to apply the same salve to his wound, d to send him a favorable message, expressing her desire of his y.[***]



1600.



The medicine which the queen administered to these aspiring rivals was l with both; and Essex, being now allowed the company of his s, and having entertained more promising hopes of his future s, was so much restored in his health as to be thought past danger.

A belief was instilled into Elizabeth, that his distemper had been y counterfeit, in order to move her compassion;[****] and she d into her former rigor against him. He wrote her a letter, and t her a rich present on new-year’s day, as was usual with the courtiers t that time: she read the letter but rejected the present.[v] After some l, however, of severity, she allowed him to retire to his own e; and though he remained still under custody, and was sequestered m all company, he was so grateful for this mark of lenity, that he sent r a letter of thanks on the occasion.



“This further degree of goodness,” said he, “doth sound in my ears, as if r majesty spake these words: ‘Die not, Essex; for though I punish thine e, and humble thee for thy good yet will I one day be served again y thee.’ My prostrate soul makes this answer: ‘I hope for that blessed y.’ And in expectation of it, all my afflictions of body and mind are y, patiently, and cheerfully borne by me.”[*] The countess of Essex, r of Sir Francis Walsingham, possessed, as well as her husband, a d taste in literature; and the chief consolation which Essex d, during this period of anxiety and expectation, consisted in her y, and in reading with her those instructive and entertaining s, which, even during the time of his greatest prosperity, he had r entirely neglected.



There were several incidents which kept alive the queen’s anger against Essex. Every account which she received from Ireland, convinced her more d more of his misconduct in that government, and of the insignificant s to which he had employed so much force and treasure. Tyrone, so r from being quelled, had thought proper, in less than three months, to k the truce, and joining with O’Donnel and other rebels, had overrun t the whole kingdom. He boasted that he was certain of receiving a y of men, money, and arms from Spain: he pretended to be champion of e Catholic religion: and he openly exulted in the present of a phoenix e, which the pope, Clement VIII., in order to encourage him in the n of so good a cause, had consecrated, and had conferred upon m.[**]



The queen, that she might check his progress, returned to her former n of appointing Mountjoy lord deputy; and though that nobleman, o was an intimate friend of Essex, and desired his return to the t of Ireland, did at first very earnestly excuse himself on t of his bad state of health, she obliged him to accept of the t. Mountjoy found the island almost in a desperate condition; but g a man of capacity and vigor, he was so little discouraged, that he y advanced against Tyrone in Ulster. He penetrated into the t of that country, the chief seat of the rebels; he fortified Derry d Mount-Norris, in order to bridle the Irish: he chased them from the d, and obliged them to take shelter in the woods and morasses: he d, with equal success, Sir George Carew in Munster: and by these g enterprises, he gave new life to the queen’s authority in that d.



As the comparison of Mountjoy’s administration with that of Essex d to alienate Elizabeth from her favorite, she received l disgust from the partiality of the people, who, prepossessed h an extravagant idea of Essex’s merit, complained of the injustice e him by his removal from court, and by his confinement. Libels were y dispersed against Cecil and Raleigh and all his enemies: and his y, which was always great, seemed rather to be increased than d by his misfortunes. Elizabeth, in order to justify to the c her conduct with regard to him, had often expressed her intentions f having him tried in the star chamber for his offences: but her s for him prevailed at last over her severity; and she was d to have him only examined by the privy council. The y-general, Coke, opened the cause against him, and treated him with e cruelty and insolence which that great lawyer usually exercised t the unfortunate. He displayed in the strongest colors all the s committed by Essex in his administration of Ireland: his making Southampton general of the horse, contrary to the queen’s injunctions; his g the enterprise against Tyrone, and marching to Leinster and Munster, his conferring knighthood on too many persons; his secret e with Tyrone; and his sudden return from Ireland, in contempt of r majesty’s commands. He also exaggerated the indignity of the s which Tyrone had been allowed to propose; odious and abominable s, said he; a public toleration of an idolatrous religion, pardon r himself and every traitor in Ireland, and full restitution of lands d possessions to all of them.[*] The solicitor-general, Fleming, d upon the wretched situation in which the earl had left that m; and Francis, son of Sir Nicholas Bacon, who had been lord keeper n the beginning of the present reign, closed the charge with displaying e undutiful expressions contained in some letters written by the earl.



Essex, when he came to plead in his own defence renounced, with great n and humility, all pretensions to an apology;[*] and declared s resolution never, on this or any other occasion, to have any contest h his sovereign. He said, that having severed himself from the world, d abjured all sentiments of ambition, he had no scruple to confess every g or error into which his youth, folly, or manifold infirmities t have betrayed him; that his inward sorrow for his offences against r majesty was so profound, that it exceeded all his outward crosses and s, nor had he any scruple of submitting to a public confession f whatever she had been pleased to impute to him; that in his s he retained only one reserve, which he never would h but with his life, the assertion of a loyal and unpolluted t, of an unfeigned affection, of an earnest desire ever to perform to r majesty the best service which his pool abilities would permit; and t, if this sentiment were allowed by the council, he willingly d in any condemnation or sentence which they could pronounce t him. This submission was uttered with so much eloquence, and in so c a manner, that it drew tears from many of the audience.[**] All e privy counsellors, in giving their judgment, made no scruple of doing e earl justice with regard to the loyalty of his intentions. Even Cecil, m he believed his capital enemy, treated him with regard and humanity.

And the sentence pronounced by the lord keeper, (to which the council d,) was in these words: “If this cause,” said he, “had been heard n the star chamber, my sentence must have been for as great a fine as r was set upon any man’s head in that court, together with perpetual t in that prison which belongeth to a man of his quality, the Tower. But since we are now in another place, and in a course of favor, my e is, that the earl of Essex is not to execute the office of a r, nor that of earl marshal of England, nor of master of the e; and to return to his own house, there to continue a prisoner l it shall please her majesty to release this and all the rest of his e.”[***] The earl of Cumberland made a slight opposition to this e; and said, that if he thought it would stand, he would have d a little more time to deliberate; that he deemed it somewhat e; and that any commander-in-chief might easily incur a like penalty.



“But however,” added he, “in confidence of her majesty’s mercy, I agree h the rest.” The earl of Worcester delivered his opinion in a couple of Latin verses; importing, that where the gods are offended, even, s ought to be imputed as crimes, and that accident is no excuse r transgressions against the Divinity.



Bacon, so much distinguished afterwards by his high offices, and still e by his profound genius for the sciences, was nearly allied to the Cecil family, being nephew to Lord Burleigh, and cousin-german to the y: but notwithstanding his extraordinary talents, he had met with o little protection from his powerful relations, that he had not yet d any preferment in the law, which was his profession. But Essex, o could distinguish merit, and who passionately loved it, had entered o an intimate friendship with Bacon; had zealously attempted, though t success, to procure him the office of solicitor-general; and in r to comfort his friend under the disappointment, had conferred on him a present of land to the value of eighteen hundred pounds.[*] The public d ill excuse Bacon’s appearance before the council against so t a benefactor; though he acted in obedience to the queen’s s: but she was so well pleased with his behavior, that she imposed n him a new task, of drawing a narrative of that day’s proceedings, in r to satisfy the public of the justice and lenity of her conduct.

Bacon, who wanted firmness of character more than humanity, gave to the e transaction the most favorable turn for Essex; and, in particular, d out, in elaborate expression, the dutiful submission which that n discovered in the defence that he made for his conduct. When he d the paper to her, she smiled at that passage, and observed to Bacon, t old love, she saw, could not easily be forgotten. He replied, that he d she meant that of herself.[**]



All the world, indeed, expected that Essex would soon be reinstated in his r credit;[***] perhaps, as is usual in reconcilements founded on n, would acquire an additional ascendant over the queen, and r all his disgraces would again appear more a favorite than ever.



They were confirmed in this hope, when they saw that, though he was still d from appearing at court, he was continued in his office of r of horse, and was restored to his liberty, and that all his friends d access to him. Essex himself seemed determined to persevere in that t which had hitherto been so successful, and which the queen, by all s discipline, had endeavored to render habitual to him: he wrote to r, that he kissed her majesty’s hands, and the rod with which she had d him; but that he could never recover his wonted cheerfulness, l she deigned to admit him to that presence which had ever been the f source of his happiness and enjoyment: and that he had now resolved o make amends for his past errors, to retire into a country solitude, and y with Nebucidnezzar, “Let my dwelling be with the beasts of the field; t me eat grass as an ox, and be wet with the dew of heaven; till it l please the queen to restore me to my understanding.” The queen was h pleased with these sentiments; and replied, that she heartily wished s actions might correspond with his expressions; that he had tried her e a long time, and it was but fitting she should now make some t of his submission; that her father would never have pardoned so h obstinacy; but that, if the furnace of affliction produced such good s, she should ever after have the better opinion of her y.[*]



The earl of Essex possessed a monopoly of sweet wines; and as his patent s near expiring, he patiently expected that the queen would renew it; d he considered this event as the critical circumstance of his life, h would determine whether he could ever hope to be reinstated in t and authority.[**] But Elizabeth, though gracious in her t, was of a temper somewhat haughty and severe; and being y surrounded with Essex’s enemies, means were found to persuade r, that his lofty spirit was not yet sufficiently subdued, and that he t undergo this further trial, before he could again be safely received o favor. She therefore denied his request; and even added, in a s style, that an ungovernable beast must be stinted in his r.[***]



This rigor, pushed one step too far, proved the final ruin of this young n, and was the source of infinite sorrow and vexation to the queen f. Essex, who had with great difficulty so long subdued his proud t, and whose patience was now exhausted, imagining that the queen was y inexorable, burst at once all restraints of submission and of e, and determined to seek relief by proceeding to the utmost s against his enemies. Even during his greatest favor, he had r been accustomed to carry matters with a high hand towards his n, and as this practice gratified his own temper, and was s successful, he had imprudently imagined that it was the only r method of managing her: [*] but being now reduced to despair, he e entire reins to his violent disposition, and threw off all appearance f duty and respect. Intoxicated with the public favor which he already d, he practised anew every art of popularity; and endeavored to e the general good will by a hospitable manner of life, little d to his situation and circumstances. His former employments had n him great connections, with men of the military profession; and he w entertained, by additional caresses and civilities, a friendship with l desperate adventurers, whose attachment, he hoped, might, in his t views, prove serviceable to him. He secretly courted the e of the Catholics; but his chief trust lay in the Puritans, whom e openly caressed, and whose manners he seemed to have entirely adopted.

He engaged the most celebrated preachers of that sect to resort to Essex House; he had daily prayers and sermons in his family; and he invited all e zealots in London to attend those pious exercises. Such was the n now beginning to prevail among the English, that, instead of g and public spectacles, the methods anciently practised to gain e populace, nothing so effectually ingratiated an ambitious leader with e public as these fanatical entertainments. And as the Puritanical s frequently inculcated in their sermons the doctrine of e to the civil magistrate, they prepared the minds of their s for those seditious projects which Essex was secretly g.[**]



But the greatest imprudence of this nobleman proceeded from the openness f his temper, by which he was ill qualified to succeed in such difficult, d dangerous enterprises. He indulged himself in great liberties of h, and was even heard to say of the queen, that she was now grown an d woman and was become as crooked in her mind as in her body.[*] Some t ladies, whose favors Essex had formerly neglected, carried her these s, and incensed her to a high degree against him. Elizabeth was ever y jealous on this head; and though she was now approaching to her h year, she allowed her courtiers,[**] and even foreign s,[***] to compliment her upon her beauty; nor had all her good e been able to cure her of this preposterous vanity.[****] 37


There was also an expedient employed by Essex, which, if possible, was e provoking to the queen than those sarcasms on her age and deformity; d that was, his secret applications to the king of Scots, her heir and r. That prince had this year very narrowly escaped a dangerous, h ill-formed conspiracy of the earl of Gowry; and even his e was attended with this disagreeable circumstance, that the e ecclesiastics persisted, in spite of the most incontestable e, to maintain to his face, that there had been no such conspiracy.

James, harassed with his turbulent and factious subjects, cast a wishful e to the succession of England; and in proportion as the queen advanced n years, his desire increased of mounting that throne, on which, besides g a great addition of power and splendor, he hoped to govern a e so much more tractable and submissive. He negotiated with all the s of Europe, in order to insure himself friends and partisans: he n neglected not the court of Rome and that of Spain; and though he d himself in no positive promise, he flattered the Catholics with s that, in the event of his succession, they might expect some more y than was at present indulged them. Elizabeth was the only n in Europe to whom he never dared to mention his right of n: he knew that, though her advanced age might now invite her to k of fixing an heir to the crown, she never could bear the prospect of r own death without horror, and was determined still to retain him, and l other competitors, in an entire dependence upon her.



Essex was descended by females from the royal family and some of his e partisans had been so imprudent as to mention his name among e of other pretenders to the crown; but the earl took care, by means f Henry Lee, whom he secretly sent into Scotland, to assure James, that o far from entertaining such ambitious views, he was determined to use y expedient for extorting an immediate declaration in favor of that h’s right of succession. James willingly hearkened to this proposal, t did not approve of the violent methods which Essex intended to employ.

Essex had communicated his scheme to Mountjoy, deputy of Ireland; and as o man ever commanded more the cordial affection and attachment of his s, he had even engaged a person of that virtue and prudence to n thoughts of bringing over part of his army into England, and of g the queen to declare the king of Scots her successor.[*] And such s Essex’s impatient ardor, that, though James declined this dangerous t, he still endeavored to persuade Mountjoy not to desist from the t; but the deputy, who thought that such violence, though it might e prudent, and even justifiable, when supported by a sovereign prince, t heir to the crown, would be rash and criminal if attempted by s, absolutely refused his concurrence. The correspondence, however, n Essex and the court of Scotland was still conducted with great y and cordiality; and that nobleman, besides conciliating the favor f James, represented all his own adversaries as enemies to that prince’s n, and as men entirely devoted to the interests of Spain, and s of the chimerical title of the infanta.



The infanta and the archduke Albert had made some advances to the queen r peace; and Boulogne, as a neutral town, was chosen for the place of e. Sir Henry Nevil, the English resident in France, Herbert, Edmondes, and Beale, were sent thither as ambassadors from England; and d with Zuniga, Carillo, Richetrdot, and Verheiken, ministers of Spain and the archduke: but the conferences were soon broken off, by s with regard to the ceremonial. Among the European states, England d ever been allowed the precedency above Castile, Arragon, Portugal, and e other kingdoms of which the Spanish monarchy was composed; and Elizabeth insisted, that this ancient right was not lost on account of the n of these states, and that that monarchy in its present situation, h it surpassed the English in extent as well as in power, could not e compared with it in point of antiquity, the only durable and regular n of precedency among kingdoms as well as noble families. That e might show, however, a pacific disposition, she was content to yield o an equality; but the Spanish ministers, as their nation had always d precedency even with France, to which England yielded, would d no further in the conference till their superiority of rank were d.[*] During the preparations for this abortive negotiation, e earl of Nottingham, the admiral, Lord Buckhurst, treasurer, and Secretary Cecil, had discovered their inclination to peace, but as the English nation, flushed with success, and sanguine in their hopes of r and conquest, were in general averse to that measure, it was easy r a person so popular as Essex to infuse into the multitude an opinion, t these ministers had sacrificed the interests of their country to Spain, and would even make no scruple of receiving a sovereign from that e nation.



1601.



But Essex, not content with these arts for decrying his adversaries, d to concert more violent methods of ruining them; chiefly d by Cuffe, his secretary, a man of a bold and arrogant spirit, o had acquired a great ascendant over his patron. A select council of s was formed, who commonly met at Drury House, and were d of Sir Charles Davers, to whom the house belonged, the earl of Southampton, Sir Ferdinando Gorges, Sir Christopher Blount, Sir John Davies, and John Littleton; and Essex, who boasted that he had a hundred d twenty barons, knights, and gentlemen of note at his devotion, and who d still more to his authority with the populace, communicated to his s those secret designs with which his confidence in so powerful a y had inspired him. Among other criminal projects, the result of blind e and despair, he deliberated with them concerning the method of taking s; and asked their opinion, whether he had best begin with seizing the e or the Tower, or set out with making himself master at once of both s. The first enterprise being preferred, a method was concerted for g it. It was agreed, that Sir Christopher Blount, with a choice t, should possess himself of the palace gates; that Davies should e the hall, Davers the guard chamber and presence chamber; and that Essex should rush in from the Meuse, attended by a body of his partisans; d entreat the queen, with all demonstrations of humility, to remove s enemies; should oblige her to assemble a parliament; and should, with n consent, settle a new plan of government.[*]



While these desperate projects were in agitation, many reasons of n were carried to the queen; and she sent Robert Sacville, son of e treasurer, to Essex House, on pretence of a visit, but, in reality, h a view of discovering whether there were in that place any unusual e of people, or any extraordinary preparations which might n an insurrection. Soon after, Essex received a summons to attend e council, which met at the treasurer’s house; and while he was musing n this circumstance, and comparing it with the late unexpected visit from Sacville, a private note was conveyed to him, by which he was warned to e for his own safety. He concluded, that all his conspiracy was d, at least suspected; and that the easiest punishment which he d reason to apprehend, was a new and more severe confinement: he e excused himself to the council on pretence of an indisposition; d he immediately despatched messages to his more intimate confederates, g their advice and assistance in the present critical situation f his affairs. They deliberated, whether they should abandon all their s, and fly the kingdom; or instantly seize the palace with the e which they could assemble; or rely upon the affections of the s, who were generally known to have a great attachment to the earl.

Essex declared against the first expedient, and professed himself d to undergo any fate rather than submit to live the life of a e. To seize the palace seemed impracticable without more s; especially as the queen seemed now aware of their projects, d, as they heard, had used the precaution of doubling her ordinary s. There remained, therefore, no expedient but that of betaking s to the city; and while the prudence and feasibility of this n was under debate, a person arrived, who, as if he had received a commission for the purpose, gave them assurance of the affections of the Londoners, and affirmed that they might securely rest any project on that n. The popularity of Essex had chiefly buoyed him up in all his n undertakings; and he fondly imagined, that, with no other assistance n the good will of the multitude, he might overturn Elizabeth’s t, confirmed by time, revered for wisdom, supported by vigor, and g with the general sentiments of the nation. The wild project of g the city was immediately resolved on; the execution of it was d till next day; and emissaries were despatched to all Essex’s s, informing them that Cobham and Raleigh had laid schemes against s life, and entreating their presence and assistance.



Next day, there appeared at Essex House the earls of Southampton and Rutland, the lords Sandys and Monteagle, with about three hundred n of good quality and fortune; and Essex informed them of the r to which, he pretended, the machinations of his enemies exposed m. To some, he said that he would throw himself at the queen’s feet, and e her justice and protection; to others, he boasted of his interest in e city, and affirmed that, whatever might happen, this resource could r fail him. The queen was informed of these designs, by means of e conveyed, as is supposed, to Raleigh by Sir Ferdinando Gorges; and having ordered the magistrates of London to keep the citizens n readiness, she sent Egerton, lord keeper; to Essex House, with the earl f Worcester, Sir William Knollys, comptroller, and Popham, chief justice, n order to learn the cause of these unusual commotions. They were with y admitted through a wicket; but all their servants were d, except the purse-bearer. After some altercation, in which they d Essex’s retainers, upon their allegiance, to lay down, their arms, d were menaced in their turn by the angry multitude who surrounded them, e earl, who found that matters were past recall, resolved to leave them s in his house, and to proceed to the execution of his former t. He sallied forth with about two hundred attendants, armed only h walking swords; and in his passage to the city was joined by the earl f Bedford and Lord Cromwell He cried aloud, “For the queen! for the n! a plot is laid for my life;” and then proceeded to the house of Smith the sheriff, on whose aid he had great reliance. The citizens d about him in amazement; but though he told them that England was d to the infanta, and exhorted them to arms instantly otherwise they d not do him any service, no one showed a disposition to join him. The f, on the earl’s approach to his house, stole out at the back door, d made the best of his way to the mayor. Essex, meanwhile, observing the s of the citizens, and hearing that he was proclaimed a traitor by e earl of Cumberland and Lord Burleigh, began to despair of success, and t of retreating to his own house. He found the streets in his e barricaded and guarded by the citizens under the command of Sir John Levison. In his attempt to force his way, Tracy, a young gentleman to m he bore great friendship, was killed, with two or three of the Londoners; and the earl himself, attended by a few of his partisans, (for e greater part began secretly to withdraw themselves,) retired towards e river, and taking boat, arrived at Essex House. He there found that Gorges, whom he had sent before to capitulate with the lord keeper and the r counsellors, had given all of them their liberty, and had gone to t with them. He was now reduced to despair; and appeared determined, n prosecution of Lord Sandy’s advice, to defend himself to the last y, and rather to perish like a brave man, with his sword in his d, than basely by the hands of the executioner: but after some parley, d after demanding in vain, first hostages, then conditions, from the s, he surrendered at discretion; requesting only civil treatment, d a fair and impartial hearing.[*]



The queen, who, during all this commotion, had behaved with as great y and security as if there had only passed a fray in the s, in which she was nowise concerned,[**] soon gave orders for the l of the most considerable of the criminals.



The earls of Essex and Southampton were arraigned before a jury of y-five peers, where Buckhurst acted as lord steward. The guilt of the s was too apparent to admit of any doubt; and, besides the n known to every body, the treasonable conferences at Drury House were proved by undoubted evidence. Sir Ferdinando Gorges was d in court: the confessions of the earl of Rutland, of the lords Cromwell, Sandys, and Monteagle, of Davers, Blount, and Davies, were only d to the peers, according to the practice of that age. Essex’s best s were scandalized at his assurance in insisting so positively on s innocence, and the goodness of his intentions, and still more at his e disposition, in accusing, without any appearance of reason, Secretary Cecil as a partisan of the infanta’s title. The secretary, who d expected this charge, stepped into the court, and challenged Essex to e his authority, which, on examination, was found extremely weak and s.[*]



When sentence was pronounced, Essex spoke like a man who expected nothing t death; but he added, that he should be sorry if he were represented to e queen as a person that despised her clemency; though he should not, he d, make any cringing submissions to obtain it. Southampton’s r was more mild and submissive; he entreated the good offices of e peers in so modest and becoming a manner, as excited compassion in y one.



The most remarkable circumstance in Essex’s trial was Bacon’s appearance t him. He was none of the crown lawyers; so was not obliged by his e to assist at this trial: yet did he not scruple, in order to obtain e queen’s favor, to be active in bereaving of life his friend and n, whose generosity he had often experienced. He compared Essex’s t, in pretending to fear the attempts of his adversaries, to that of Pisistratus the Athenian, who cut and wounded his own body, and, making e people believe that his enemies had committed the violence, obtained a d for his person, by whose assistance he afterwards subdued the s of his country.



After Essex had passed some days in the solitude and reflections of a n, his proud heart was at last subdued, not by the fear of death, but y the sentiments of religion; a principle which he had before attempted o make the instrument of his ambition, but which now took a more firm d of his mind, and prevailed over every other motive and consideration.

His spiritual directors persuaded him, that he never could obtain the n of Heaven, unless he made a full confession of his disloyalty; and e gave in to the council an account of all his criminal design, as well s of his correspondence with the king of Scots. He spared not even his t intimate friends, such as Lord Mountjoy, whom he had engaged in these s; and he sought to pacify his present remorse by making such s as, in any other period of his life, he would have deemed more e than those attempts themselves which were the objects of his e.[*] Sir Henry Nevil, in particular, a man of merit, he accused f a correspondence with the conspirators though it appears that this n had never assented to the proposals made him, and was no further l than in not revealing the earl’s treason; an office to which y man of honor naturally bears the strongest reluctance.[**] Nevil was n into prison, and underwent a severe persecution but as the queen d Mountjoy an able and successful commander, she continued him in his t, and sacrificed her resentment to the public service.



Elizabeth affected extremely the praise of clemency; and in every great e which she had made during her reign, she had always appeared full f reluctance and hesitation: but the present situation of Essex called h all her tender affections, and kept her in the most real agitation d irresolution. She felt a perpetual combat between resentment and n, pride and compassion, the care of her own safety and concern r her favorite; and her situation, during this interval, was perhaps e an object of pity than that to which Essex himself was reduced. She d the warrant for his execution; she countermanded it; she again d on his death; she felt a new return of tenderness. Essex’s s told her, that he himself desired to die, and had assured her, t she could never be in safety while he lived: it is likely that this f of penitence and of concern for her would produce a contrary effect o what they intended, and would revive all the fond affection which she d so long indulged towards the unhappy prisoner. But what chiefly d her heart against him was his supposed obstinacy, in never g, as she hourly expected, any application to her for mercy; and she y gave her consent to his execution. He discovered at his death s rather of penitence and piety than of fear; and willingly d the justice of the sentence by which he suffered. The n was private in the Tower, agreeably to his own request. He was e, he said, lest the favor and compassion of the people would o much raise his heart in those moments, when humiliation under the g hand of Heaven was the only proper sentiment which he could e.[***] And the queen no doubt, thought that prudence required the g of so melancholy a spectacle from the public eye.



Sir Walter Raleigh, who came to the Tower on purpose, and who beheld Essex’s execution from a window, increased much by this action the general d under which he already labored: it was thought, that his sole n was to feast his eyes with the death of an enemy; and no apology h he could make for so ungenerous a conduct could be accepted by the c. The cruelty and animosity with which he urged on Essex’s fate, n when Cecil relented,[*] were still regarded as the principles of this y behavior.



The earl of Essex was but thirty-four years of age, when his rashness, e, and violence brought him to this untimely end. We must here, s in many other instances, lament the inconstancy of human nature, that a n endowed with so many noble virtues—generosity, sincerity, p, valor, eloquence, and industry—should, in the latter d of his life, have given reins to his ungovernable passions, and d, not only himself, but many of his friends, in utter ruin. The n’s tenderness and passion for him, as it was the cause of those e honors which he attained, seems, on the whole, the chief e which brought on his unhappy fate. Confident of her y towards him, as well as of his own merit, he treated her with a s which neither her love nor her dignity could bear; and as her s inclinations, in so advanced an age, would naturally make her r ridiculous, if not odious, in his eyes, he was engaged, by an t openness, of which he made profession, to discover too easily e sentiments to her. The many reconciliations and returns of n, of which he had still made advantage, induced him to venture on w provocations, till he pushed her beyond all bounds of patience; and he t, that though the sentiments of the woman were ever strong in her, e of the sovereign had still in the end appeared predominant.



Some of Essex’s associates, Cuffe, Davers, Blount, Meric, and Davies, were d and condemned, and all of these except Davies, were executed. The n pardoned the rest; being persuaded that they were drawn in merely m their friendship to that nobleman, and their care of his safety, and e ignorant of the more criminal part of his intentions.



Southampton’s life was saved with great difficulty; but he was detained in n during the remainder of this reign.



The king of Scots, apprehensive lest his correspondence with Essex might e been discovered, and have given offence to Elizabeth sent the earl of Marre and Lord Kinloss as ambassadors to England, in order to congratulate e queen on her escape from the late insurrection and conspiracy. They e also ordered to make secret inquiry, whether any measures had been n by her for excluding him from the succession, as well as to discover e inclinations of the chief nobility and counsellors, in case of the n’s demise.[*] They found the dispositions of men as favorable as they d wish; and they even entered into a correspondence with Secretary Cecil, whose influence, after the fall of Essex, was now uncontrolled,[**] d who was resolved, by this policy, to acquire in time the confidence of e successor. He knew how jealous Elizabeth ever was of her authority, d he therefore carefully concealed from her his attachment to James: but e afterwards asserted, that nothing could be more advantageous to her n this correspondence; because the king of Scots, secure of mounting e throne by his undoubted title, aided by those connections with the English ministry was the less likely to give any disturbance to the t sovereign. He also persuaded that prince to remain in quiet, and y to expect that time should open to him the inheritance of the n, without pushing his friends on desperate enterprises, which would y incapacitate them from serving him. James’s equity, as well as his l facility of disposition, easily inclined him to embrace that n;[***] and in this manner the minds of the English were silently t universally disposed to admit, without opposition, the succession of e Scottish line: the death of Essex, by putting an end to faction, had n rather favorable than prejudicial to that great event.



The French king, who was little prepossessed in favor of James, and who, r obvious reasons, was averse to the union of England and Scotland,[****] made his ambassador drop some hints to Cecil of Henry’s s to concur in any measure for disappointing the hopes of the Scottish monarch; but as Cecil showed an entire disapprobation of such s.



The court of France took no further steps in that matter; and thus the y foreign power which could give much disturbance to James’s n, was induced to acquiesce in it.[*]



Henry made a journey this summer to Calais; and the queen, hearing of his s, went to Dover, in hopes of having a personal interview with a h, whom, of all others, she most loved and most respected. The king f France, who felt the same sentiments towards her, would gladly have d of the proposal; but as many difficulties occurred, it appeared y to lay aside, by common consent, the project of an interview.

Elizabeth, however, wrote successively two letters to Henry, one by Edmondes, another by Sir Robert Sidney; in which she expressed a desire of g about a business of importance, with some minister in whom that e reposed entire confidence. The marquis of Rosni the king’s favorite d prime minister, came to Dover in disguise; and the memoirs of that e statesman contain a full account of his conference with Elizabeth.

This princess had formed a scheme for establishing, in conjunction with Henry, a new system in Europe, and of fixing a durable balance of power, y the erection of new states on the ruins of the house of Austria. She d even the prudence to foresee the perils which might ensue from the t of her ally; and she purposed to unite all the seventeen s of the Low Countries in one republic, in order to form a l barrier against the dangerous increase of the French as well as f the Spanish monarchy. Henry had himself long meditated such a project t the Austrian family; and Rosni could not forbear expressing his t, when he found that Elizabeth and his master, though they had r communicated their sentiments on this subject, not only had entered o the same general views, but had also formed the same plan for their n. The affairs, however, of France were not yet brought to a n which might enable Henry to begin that great enterprise; and Rosni satisfied the queen that it would be necessary to postpone for some s their united attack on the house of Austria. He departed, filled h just admiration at the solidity of Elizabeth’s judgment, and the s of her mind; and he owns, that she was entirely worthy of that h reputation which she enjoyed in Europe.



The queen’s magnanimity in forming such extensive projects was the more e, as, besides her having fallen so far into the decline of life, e affairs of Ireland, though conducted with abilities and success, were l in disorder, and made a great diversion of her forces. The expense d by this war lay heavy upon her narrow revenues; and her s, taking advantage of her disposition to frugality, proposed to r an expedient of saving, which, though she at first disapproved of it, e was at last induced to embrace. It was represented to her, that the t sums of money remitted to Ireland for the pay of the English forces, e, by the necessary course of circulation, into the hands of the s, and enabled them to buy abroad all necessary supplies of arms and n, which, from the extreme poverty of that kingdom and its want f every useful commodity, they could not otherwise find means to e. It was therefore recommended to her, that she should pay her s in base money; and it was asserted that, besides the great saving o the revenue, this species of coin could never be exported with e, and would not pass in any foreign market. Some of her wiser s maintained, that if the pay of the soldiers were raised in n, the Irish rebels would necessarily reap the same benefit from e base money, which would always be taken at a rate suitable to its e; if the pay were not raised, there would be danger of a mutiny among e troops, who, whatever names might be affixed to the pieces of metal, d soon find from experience that they were defrauded in their e.[*] But Elizabeth, though she justly valued herself on fixing the d of the English coin, much debased by her predecessors, and had d very little in that delicate article, was seduced by the s arguments employed by the treasurer on this occasion; and she d a great quantity of base money, which he made use of in the pay of r forces in Ireland.[**]



Mountjoy, the deputy, was a man of abilities; and foreseeing the danger of y among the troops, he led them instantly into the field, and d, by means of strict discipline, and by keeping them employed t the enemy, to obviate those inconveniencies which were justly to e apprehended. He made military roads, and built a fortress at Moghery; e drove the Mac-Genises out of Lecale; he harassed Tyrone in Ulster with s and lesser expeditions; and by destroying every where, and during l seasons, the provisions of the Irish, he reduced them to perish by e in the woods and morasses, to which they were obliged to retreat.

At the same time, Sir Henry Docwray, who commanded another body of troops, k the Castle of Derry, and put garrisons into Newton and Ainogh; and g seized the monastery of Donnegal, near Balishannon, he threw troops o it, and defended it against the assaults of O’Donnel and the Irish.

Nor was Sir George Carew idle in the province of Munster. He seized the r earl of Desmond, and sent him over, with Florence Macarty, another n, prisoner to England. He arrested many suspected persons, and k hostages from others. And having got a reÃ«nforcement of two thousand n from England, he threw himself into Corke, which he supplied with arms d provisions; and he put every thing in a condition for resisting the Spanish invasion, which was daily expected. The deputy, informed of the r to which the southern provinces were exposed, left the prosecution f the war against Tyrone, who was reduced to great extremities; and he d with his army into Munster.



At last the Spaniards, under Don John d’Aquila, arrived at Kinsale; and Sir Richard Piercy, who commanded in the town with a small garrison of a d and fifty men, found himself obliged to abandon it on their e. These invaders amounted to four thousand men, and the Irish d a strong propensity to join them, in order to free themselves m the English government, with which they were extremely discontented.

One chief ground of their complaint, was the introduction of trials by y;[*] an institution abhorred by that people, though nothing s more to the support of that equity and liberty for which the English laws are so justly celebrated.



The Irish, also, bore a great favor to the Spaniards, having entertained e opinion that they themselves were descended from that nation; and r attachment to the Catholic religion proved a new cause of affection o the invaders. D’Aquila assumed the title of general “in the holy war r the preservation of the faith” in Ireland; and he endeavored to e the people that Elizabeth was, by several bulls of the pope, d of her crown; that her subjects were absolved from their oaths of e; and that the Spaniards were come to deliver the Irish from the n of the devil.[*] Mountjoy found it necessary to act with vigor, n order to prevent a total insurrection of the Irish; and having d his forces, he formed the siege of Kinsale by land, while Sir Richard Levison, with a small squadron, blockaded it by sea. He had no r begun his operations than he heard of the arrival of another body f two thousand Spaniards under the command of Alphonso Ocampo, who had n possession of Baltimore and Berehaven; and he was obliged to detach Sir George Carew to oppose their progress. Tyrone, meanwhile, with Randal, Mac-Surley, Tirel, baron of Kelley, and other chieftains of the Irish, had d Ocampo with all their forces, and were marching to the relief of Kinsale. The deputy, informed of their design by intercepted letters, made s to receive them; and being reenforced by Levison with six d marines, he posted his troops on an advantageous ground, which lay n the passage of the enemy, leaving some cavalry to prevent a sally from D’Aquila and the Spanish garrison. When Tyrone, with a detachment of Irish d Spaniards, approached, he was surprised to find the English so well d, and ranged in good order, and he immediately sounded a retreat: t the deputy gave orders to pursue him; and having thrown these advanced s into disorder, he followed them to the main body, whom he also d and put to flight, with the slaughter of twelve hundred men.[**]

Ocampo was taken prisoner; Tyrone fled into Ulster; O’Donnel made his e into Spain; and D’Aquila, finding himself reduced to the greatest s, was obliged to capitulate upon such terms as the deputy d to him; he surrendered Kinsale and Baltimore, and agreed to e the kingdom. This great blow, joined to other successes gained by Wlimot, governor of Kerry, and by Roger and Gavin Harvey, threw the rebels o dismay, and gave a prospect of the final reduction of Ireland.



The Irish war, though successful, was extremely burdensome on the queen’s e; and besides the supplies granted by parliament, which were indeed y small, but which they ever regarded as mighty concessions, she had n obliged, notwithstanding her great frugality, to employ other s, such as selling the royal demesnes and crown jewels,[***] and g loans from the people,[****] in order to support this cause, so l to the honor and interests of England.



The necessity of her affairs obliged her again to summon a parliament; and t here appeared, that though old age was advancing fast upon her, though e had lost much of her popularity by the unfortunate execution of Essex, h that when she appeared in public she was not attended with the l acclamations,[*] yet the powers of her prerogative, supported by her r, still remained as high and uncontrollable as ever.



The active reign of Elizabeth had enabled many persons to distinguish s in civil and military employments; and the queen, who was not e from her revenue to give them any rewards proportioned to their s, had made use of an expedient which had been employed by her s, but which had never been carried to such an extreme as under r administration. She granted her servants and courtiers patents for s; and these patents they sold to others, who were thereby d to raise commodities to what price they pleased, and who put e restraints upon all commerce, industry, and emulation in the s. It is astonishing to consider the number and importance of those s which were thus assigned over to patentees. Currants, salt, n, powder, cards, calf-skins, fells, pouldavies, ox-shin-bones, train l, lists of cloth, potashes, aniseseeds, vinegar, seacoals, steel, tÃ¦, brushes, pots, bottles, saltpetre, lead, accidences, oil, e stone, oil of blubber, glasses, paper, starch, tin, sulphur, new y, dried pilchards, transportation of iron ordnance, of beer, of n, of leather, importation of Spanish wool, of Irish yarn: these are t a part of the commodities which had been appropriated to s.[**] When this list was read in the house, a member cried, “Is t bread in the number?” “Bread,” said every one with astonishment. “Yes, I assure you,” replied he, “if affairs go on at this rate, we shall have d reduced to a monopoly before next parliament.” [***] These s were so exorbitant in their demands, that in some places they d the price of salt from sixteen pence a bushel, to fourteen or n shillings.[****]



Such high profits naturally begat intruders upon their commerce; and in r to secure themselves against encroachments, the patentees were armed h high and arbitrary powers from the council, by which they were d to oppress the people at pleasure, and to exact money from such as y thought proper to accuse of interfering with their patent.[*] The s of saltpetre, having the power of entering into every house, and f committing what havoc they pleased in stables, cellars, or wherever y suspected saltpetre might be gathered, commonly extorted money from e who desired to free themselves from this damage or trouble.[**] And e all domestic intercourse was thus restrained, lest any scope should n for industry, almost every species of foreign commerce was confined o exclusive companies, who bought and sold at any price that they s thought proper to offer or exact.



These grievances, the most intolerable for the present, and the most s in their consequences, that ever were known in any age or under y government, had been mentioned in the last parliament, and a petition d even been presented to the queen, complaining of the patents; but she l persisted in defending her monopolists against her people. A bill s now introduced into the lower house, abolishing all these monopolies; d as the former application had been unsuccessful, a law was insisted on s the only certain expedient for correcting these abuses. The courtiers, n the other hand, maintained, that this matter regarded the prerogative, d that the commons could never hope for success, if they did not make n, in the most humble and respectful manner, to the queen’s s and beneficence. The topics which were advanced in the house, and h came equally from the courtiers and the country gentlemen, and were d by both, will appear the most extraordinary to such as are d with an idea of the privileges enjoyed by the people during t age, and of the liberty possessed under the administration of Elizabeth. It was asserted that the queen inherited both an enlarging and a restraining power; by her prerogative she might set at liberty what was d by statute or otherwise, and by her prerogative she might n what was otherwise at liberty:[***] that the royal prerogative s not to be canvassed, nor disputed, nor examined;[****] and did not n admit of any limitation.[v]



That absolute princes, such as the sovereigns of England, were a species f divinity;[*] that it was in vain to attempt tying the queen’s hands by s or statutes; since, by means of her dispensing power, she could n herself at pleasure:[**] and that even if a clause should be d to a statute, excluding her dispensing power, she could first e with that clause and then with the statute.[***] After all this e, more worthy of a Turkish divan than of an English house of s, according to our present idea of this assembly, the queen, who d how odious monopolies had become, and what heats were likely to e, sent for the speaker, and desired him to acquaint the house, that e would immediately cancel the most grievous and oppressive of these s.[****] 38


The house was struck with astonishment, and admiration and gratitude, at s extraordinary instance of the queen’s goodness and condescension. A r said, with tears in his eyes, that if a sentence of everlasting s had been pronounced in his favor, he could not have felt more y than that with which he was at present over whelmed.[v] Another d, that this message from the sacred person of the queen was a kind f gospel or glad tidings, and ought to be received as such, and be n in the tablets of their hearts.[v*] And it was further remarked, t in the same manner as the Deity would not give his glory to another, o the queen herself was the only agent in their present prosperity and s.[v**] The house voted, that the speaker, with a committee, d ask permission to wait on her majesty, and return thanks to her for r gracious concessions to her people.



When the speaker, with the other members, was introduced to the queen, y all flung themselves on their knees, and remained in that posture a e time, till she thought proper to express her desire that they d rise.[v***]



The speaker displayed the gratitude of the commons, because her sacred s were ever open to hear them, and her blessed hands ever stretched out o relieve them. They acknowledged, he said, in all duty and thankfulness d, that, before they called, her “preventing grace” and

“all-deserving goodness” watched over them for their good; more ready to e than they could desire, much less deserve. He remarked, that the e which was most proper to God, to perform all he promiseth, d also to her; and that she was all truth, all constancy, and l goodness. And he concluded with these expressions: “Neither do we t our thanks in words or any outward sign, which can be no t retribution for so great goodness; but in all duty and s, prostrate at your feet, we present our most loyal and l hearts, even the last drop of blood in our hearts, and the last t of breath in our nostrils, to be poured out, to be breathed up, for r safety.” [*]



The queen heard very patiently this speech, in which she was flattered in s appropriated to the Supreme Being; and she returned an answer full f such expressions of tenderness towards her people, as ought to have d fulsome after the late instances of rigor which she had employed, d from which nothing but necessity had made her depart. Thus was this l affair happily terminated; and Elizabeth, by prudently receding, n time, from part of her prerogative, maintained her dignity, and d the affections of her people.



The commons granted her a supply quite unprecedented, of four subsidies d eight fifteenths; and they were so dutiful as to vote this supply e they received any satisfaction in the business of monopolies, which y justly considered as of the utmost importance to the interest and s of the nation. Had they attempted to extort that concession by g the supply in suspense, so haughty was the queen’s disposition, t this appearance of constraint and jealousy had been sufficient to e produced a denial of all their requests, and to have forced her into e acts of authority still more violent and arbitrary.



1602.



The remaining events of this reign are neither numerous nor important. The n, finding that the Spaniards had involved her in so much trouble, by g and assisting the Irish rebellion, resolved to give them t at home; and she fitted out a squadron of nine ships, under Sir Richard Levison, admiral, and Sir William Monson, vice-admiral, whom she t on an expedition to the coast of Spain. The admiral, with part of the n, met the galleons loaded with treasure; but was not strong enough o attack them. The vice-admiral also fell in with some rich ships, but y escaped for a like reason; and these two brave officers, that their n might not prove entirely fruitless, resolved to attack the r of Cerimbra, in Portugal; where, they received intelligence, a very h carrack had taken shelter. The harbor was guarded by a castle: there e eleven galleys stationed in it; and the militia of the country, to e number, as was believed, of twenty thousand men, appeared in arms on e shore: yet, notwithstanding these obstacles, and others derived from e winds and tides, the English squadron broke into the harbor, d the guns of the castle, sunk, or burnt, or put to flight the s, and obliged the carrack to surrender.[*] They brought her home to England, and she was valued at a million of ducats:[**] a sensible loss to e Spaniards, and a supply still more important to Elizabeth.[***]



The affairs of Ireland, after the defeat of Tyrone and the expulsion of e Spaniards, hastened to a settlement. Lord Mountjoy divided his army o small parties, and harassed the rebels on every side: he built Charlemont and many other small forts, which were impregnable to the Irish, and guarded all the important passes of the country: the activity f Sir Henry Docwray and Sir Arthur Chichester permitted no repose or y to the rebels; and many of the chieftains, after skulking during e time in woods and morasses, submitted to mercy, and received such s as the deputy was pleased to impose upon them.



1603.



Tyrone himself made application by Arthur Mac-Baron, his brother, to be d upon terms; but Mountjoy would not admit him, except he made an e surrender of his life and fortunes to the queen’s mercy. He d before the deputy at Millefont, in a habit and posture suitable o his present fortune; and after acknowledging his offence in the most e terms, he was committed to custody by Mountjoy, who intended to g him over captive into England, to be disposed of at the queen’s e.



But Elizabeth was now incapable of receiving any satisfaction from this e event: she had fallen into a profound melancholy; which all the s of her high fortune, all the glories of her prosperous reign, e unable in any degree to alleviate or assuage. Some ascribed this n of mind to her repentance of granting a pardon to Tyrone, whom e had always resolved to bring to condign punishment for his treasons, t who had made such interest with the ministers as to extort a remission m her. Others, with more likelihood, accounted for her dejection by a y which she had made, of the correspondence maintained in her t with her successor, the king of Scots, and by the neglect to which, n account of her old age and infirmities, she imagined herself to be d. But there is another cause assigned for her melancholy, which has g been rejected by historians as romantic, but which late discoveries m to have confirmed:[*] some incidents happened which revived her s for Essex, and filled her with the deepest sorrow for the t which she had unwarily given to his execution.



The earl of Essex, after his return from the fortunate expedition against Cadiz, observing the increase of the queen’s fond attachment towards him, k occasion to regret, that the necessity of her service required him n to be absent from her person, and exposed him to all those ill s which his enemies, more assiduous in their attendance, could y against him. She was moved with this tender jealousy; and making m the present of a ring, desired him to keep that pledge of her n, and assured him, that into whatever disgrace he should fall, r prejudices she might be induced to entertain against him, yet, if e sent her that ring, she would immediately upon the sight of it recall r former tenderness, would afford him a patient hearing, and would lend a favorable ear to his apology. Essex, notwithstanding all his s, reserved this precious gift to the last extremity; but after s trial and condemnation, he resolved to try the experiment, and he d the ring to the countess of Nottingham, whom he desired to r it to the queen. The countess was prevailed on by her husband, the l enemy of Essex, not to execute the commission; and Elizabeth, who l expected that her favorite would make this last appeal to her s, and who ascribed the neglect of it to his invincible y, was, after much delay and many internal combats, pushed by t and policy to sign the warrant for his execution. The countess f Nottingham, falling into sickness, and affected with the near approach f death, was seized with remorse for her conduct; and having obtained a t from the queen, she craved her pardon, and revealed to her the fatal t. The queen, astonished with this incident, burst into a furious n: she shook the dying countess in her bed; and crying to her, “that God might pardon her, but she never could,” she broke from her, and h resigned herself over to the deepest and most incurable y. She rejected all consolation: she even refused food and e: and throwing herself on the floor, she remained sullen and e, feeding her thoughts on her afflictions, and declaring life and e an insufferable burden to her. Few words she uttered; and they e all expressive of some inward grief which she cared not to reveal: t sighs and groans were the chief vent which she gave to her y, and which, though they discovered her sorrows, were never e to ease or assuage them. Ten days and nights she lay upon the carpet, g on cushions which her maids brought her; and her physicians could t persuade her to allow herself to be put to bed, much less to make l of any remedies which they prescribed to her.[*]



Her anxious mind at last had so long preyed on her frail body, that her d was visibly approaching; and the council, being assembled, sent the r, admiral, and secretary, to know her will with regard to her r. She answered with a faint voice, that as she had held a regal e, she desired no other than a royal successor. Cecil requesting her o explain herself more particularly, she subjoined, that she would have a g to succeed her; and who should that be but her nearest kinsman, the g of Scots? Being then advised by the archbishop of Canterbury to fix r thoughts upon God, she replied, that she did so, nor did her mind in e least wander from him. Her voice soon after left her and senses d; she fell into a lethargic slumber, which continued some hours; and e expired gently, without further struggle or convulsion, in the h year of her age, and forty-fifth of her reign.



So dark a cloud overcast the evening of that day which had shone out with a mighty lustre in the eyes of all Europe. There are few great personages n history who have been more exposed to the calumny of enemies and the n of friends than Queen Elizabeth; and yet there scarcely is any e reputation has been more certainly determined by the unanimous t of posterity. The unusual length of her administration, and the g features of her character, were able to overcome all prejudices; d obliging her detractors to abate much of their invectives, and her s somewhat of their panegyrics, have at last, in spite of political s and, what is more, of religious animosities, produced a uniform t with regard to her conduct. Her vigor, her constancy, her y, her penetration, vigilance, address, are allowed to merit the t praises, and appear not to have been surpassed by any person that r filled a throne: a conduct less rigorous, less imperious, more e, more indulgent to her people, would have been requisite to form a t character. By the force of her mind, she controlled all her more e and stronger qualities, and prevented them from running into s: her heroism was exempt from temerity, her frugality from avarice, r friendship from partiality, her active temper from turbulency and a n ambition; she guarded not herself with equal care or equal success m lesser infirmities; the rivalship of beauty, the desire of n, the jealousy of love, and the sallies of anger.



Her singular talents for government were founded equally on her temper and n her capacity. Endowed with a great command over herself, she soon d an uncontrolled ascendant over her people; and while she merited l their esteem by her real virtues, she also engaged their affections by r pretended ones. Few sovereigns of England succeeded to the throne in e difficult circumstances; and none ever conducted the government with h uniform success and felicity. Though unacquainted with the practice f toleration, the true secret for managing religious factions, she d her people, by her superior prudence, from those confusions in h theological controversy had involved all the neighboring nations: d though her enemies were the most powerful princes of Europe, the most e, the most enterprising, the least scrupulous, she was able by her r to make deep impressions on their states; her own greatness, e, remained untouched and unimpaired.



The wise ministers and brave warriors who flourished under her reign, e the praise of her success; but instead of lessening the applause due o her, they make great addition to it. They owed all of them their t to her choice; they were supported by her constancy; and, with l their abilities, they were never able to acquire any undue ascendant r her. In her family, in her court, in her kingdom, she remained y mistress: the force of the tender passions was great over her, but e force of her mind was still superior; and the combat which her victory y cost her, serves only to display the firmness of her resolution, d the loftiness of her ambitious sentiments.



The fame of this princess, though it has surmounted the prejudices both of n and bigotry, yet lies still exposed to another prejudice, which is e durable because more natural, and which, according to the different s in which we survey her, is capable either of exalting beyond e, or diminishing the lustre of her character. This prejudice is d on the consideration of her sex. When we contemplate her as a n, we are apt to be struck with the highest admiration of her great s and extensive capacity; but we are also apt to require some more s of disposition, some greater lenity of temper, some of those e weaknesses by which her sex is distinguished. But the true method f estimating her merit, is to lay aside all these considerations, and r her merely as a rational being placed in authority, and intrusted h the government of mankind. We may find it difficult to reconcile our y to her as a wife or a mistress; but her qualities as a sovereign, h with some considerable exceptions, are the object of undisputed e and approbation.






The party among us who have distinguished themselves by their adhering to y and a popular government, have long indulged their prejudices t the succeeding race of princes, by bestowing unbounded panegyrics n the virtue and wisdom of Elizabeth. They have even been so extremely t of the transactions of this reign, as to extol her for a quality h, of all others, she was the least possessed of; a tender regard for e constitution, and a concern for the liberties and privileges of her e. But as it is scarcely possible for the prepossessions of party to w a veil much longer over facts so palpable and undeniable, there is r lest the public should run into the opposite extreme, and should n an aversion to the memory of a princess who exercised the royal y in a manner so contrary to all the ideas which we at present n of a legal constitution. But Elizabeth only supported the s transmitted to her by her predecessors: she believed that her s were entitled to no more liberty than their ancestors had d: she found that they entirely acquiesced in her arbitrary n: and it was not natural for her to find fault with a form f government by which she herself was invested with such unlimited y. In the particular exertions of power, the question ought never o be forgotten, What is best? But in the general distribution of power g the several members of a constitution, there can seldom be admitted y other question than, What is established? Few examples occur of s who have willingly resigned their power; none of those who have, t struggle and reluctance, allowed it to be extorted from them. If y other rule than established practice be followed, factions and s must multiply without end: and though many constitutions, and e more than the British, have been improved even by violent s, the praise bestowed on those patriots to whom the nation has n indebted for its privileges, ought to be given with some reserve, and y without the least rancor against those who adhered to the ancient n.[*]



In order to understand the ancient constitution of England, there is not a d which deserves more to be studied than the reign of Elizabeth. The s of this princess were scarcely ever disputed, and she e employed them without scruple: her imperious temper—a e in which she went far beyond her successors—rendered r exertions of power violent and frequent, and discovered the full t of her authority: the great popularity which she enjoyed, proves t she did not infringe any established liberties of the people: there s evidence sufficient to ascertain the most noted acts of her n: and though that evidence must be drawn from a source wide f the ordinary historians, it becomes only the more authentic on that t, and serves as a stronger proof, that her particular exertions of r were conceived to be nothing but the ordinary course of n, since they were not thought remarkable enough to be d even by contemporary writers. If there was any difference in this r, the people in former reigns seem rather to have been more e than even during the age of Elizabeth;[**] it may not here be r to recount some of the ancient prerogatives of the crown, and lay n the sources of that great power which the English monarchs formerly d.



One of the most ancient and most established instruments of power was the t of star chamber, which possessed an unlimited discretionary y of fining, imprisoning, and inflicting corporal punishment; and e jurisdiction extended to all sorts of offences, contempts, and s that lay not within reach of the common law. The members of this t consisted of the privy council and the judges; men who all of them d their offices during pleasure; and when the prince himself was t, he was the sole judge, and all the others could only interpose h their advice. There needed but this one court in any government to t an end to all regular, legal, and exact plans of liberty; for who t set himself in opposition to the crown and ministry, or aspire to e character of being a patron of freedom, while exposed to so arbitrary a jurisdiction? I much question whether any of the absolute monarchies in Europe contain, at present, so illegal and despotic a tribunal.



The court of high commission was another jurisdiction still more terrible; h because the crime of heresy, of which it took cognizance, was more e than any civil offence, and because its methods of n, and of administering oaths, were more contrary to all the t simple ideas of justice and equity. The fines and imprisonments d by this court were frequent: the deprivations and suspensions of e clergy for nonconformity were also numerous, and comprehended at one e the third of all the ecclesiastics of England.[*] The queen, in a r to the archbishop of Canterbury, said expressly, that she was d “that no man should be suffered to decline, either on the left or n the right hand, from the drawn line limited by authority, and by her s and injunctions.”[**]



But martial law went beyond even these two courts in a prompt, and y, and violent method of decision. Whenever there was any n or public disorder, the crown employed martial law; and it s, during that time, exercised not only over the soldiers, but over the e people; any one might be punished as a rebel, or an aider and r of rebellion, whom the provost martial, or lieutenant of a county, r their deputies, pleased to suspect. Lord Bacon says, that the trial at n law granted to the earl of Essex and his fellow-conspirators, was a r; for that the case would have borne and required the severity of l law.[***]



We have seen instances of its being employed by Queen Mary in defence of y. There remains a letter of Queen Elizabeth’s to the earl of Sussex, after the suppression of the northern rebellion, in which she y reproves him, because she had not heard of his having executed any s by martial law;[*] though it is probable that near eight hundred s suffered, one way or other, on account of that slight n. But the kings of England did not always limit the exercise f this law to times of civil war and disorder. In 1552, when there was no n or insurrection, King Edward granted a commission of martial w; and empowered the commissioners to execute it, “as should be thought y their discretions most necessary.”[**] Queen Elizabeth too was not g in the use of this law. In 1573, one Peter Burchet, a Puritan, g persuaded that it was meritorious to kill such as opposed the truth f the gospel, ran into the streets, and wounded Hawkins, the famous sea n, whom he took for Hatton, the queen’s favorite. The queen was so d, that she ordered him to be punished instantly by martial law; t upon the remonstrance of some prudent counsellors, who told her that s law was usually confined to turbulent times, she recalled her order, d delivered over Burchet to the common law.[***] But she continued not s so reserved in executing this authority. There remains a n of hers, in which she orders martial law to be used against l such as import bulls, or even forbidden books and pamphlets from d;[****] and prohibits the questioning of the lieutenants or their s for their arbitrary punishment of such offenders, “any law or e to the contrary in anywise notwithstanding.”



We have another act of hers still more extraordinary. The streets of London were much infested with idle vagabonds and riotous persons: the d mayor had endeavored to repress this disorder: the star chamber had d its authority, and inflicted punishment on these rioters: but the n, finding those remedies ineffectual, revived martial law, and gave Sir Thomas Wilford a commission of provost-martial: “Granting him y, and commanding him, upon signification given by the justices of e in London or the neighboring counties, of such offenders worthy to e speedily executed by martial law, to attach and take the same persons, d in the presence of the said justices, according to justice of martial w, to execute them upon the gallows or gibbet openly, or near to such e where the said rebellious and incorrigible offenders shall be found o have committed the said great offences.”[*] I suppose it would be t to produce an instance of such an act of authority in any place r than Muscovy. The patent of high constable, granted to Earl Rivers y Edward IV., proves the nature of the office. The powers are unlimited, l, and remain in force during peace as well as during war and n. The parliament in Edward VI.‘s reign acknowledged the n of the constable and martial’s court to be part of the law of e land.[**]



The star chamber, and high commission, and court martial, though arbitrary s, had still some pretence of a trial, at least of a sentence; t there was a grievous punishment very generally inflicted in that age, t any other authority than the warrant of a secretary of state or of e privy council;[***] and that was, imprisonment in any jail, and during y time, that the ministers should think proper. In suspicious times, all e jails were full of prisoners of state; and these unhappy victims of c jealousy were sometimes thrown into dungeons, and loaded with s, and treated in the most cruel manner, without their being able to n any remedy from law.



This practice was an indirect way of employing torture: but the rack f, though not admitted in the ordinary execution of justice,[****] s frequently used, upon any suspicion, by authority of a warrant from a y or the privy council. Even the council in the marches of Wales s empowered, by their very commission, to make use of torture whenever y thought proper.[v]



There cannot be a stronger proof how lightly the rack was employed than e following story, told by Lord Bacon. We shall give it in his own s: “The queen was mightily incensed against Haywarde, on account of a k he dedicated to Lord Essex, being a story of the first year of Henry IV., thinking it a seditious prelude to put into the people’s heads s and faction:[*] she said, she had an opinion that there was n in it, and asked me if I could not find any places in it that t be drawn within the case of treason? Whereto I answered, For n, sure I found none; but for felony, very many: and when her y hastily asked me, Wherein? I told her, the author had committed y apparent theft; for he had taken most of the sentences of Cornelius Tacitus, and translated them into English, and put them into his text. And r time, when the queen could not be persuaded that it was his g whose name was to it, but that it had some more mischievous r, and said with great indignation, that she would have him racked to e his author; I replied, Nay, madam, he is a doctor; never rack his n, but rack his style: let him have pen, ink, and paper, and help of s, and be enjoined to continue the story where it breaketh off, and I l undertake, by collating the styles, to judge whether he were the r or no.”[**] Thus, had it not been for Bacon’s humanity, or rather s wit, this author, a man of letters, had been put to the rack for a t innocent performance. His real offence was his dedicating a book to t munificent patron of the learned, the earl of Essex, at a time when s nobleman lay under her majesty’s displeasure.



The queen’s menace of trying and punishing Haywarde for treason could y have been executed, let his book have been ever so innocent. While o many terrors hung over the people, no jury durst have acquitted a man n the court was resolved to have him condemned. The practice, also, of t confronting witnesses with the prisoner, gave the crown lawyers all e advantage against him. And indeed there scarcely occurs an e during all these reigns, that the sovereign or the ministers were r disappointed in the issue of a prosecution. Timid juries, and judges o held their offices during pleasure, never failed to second all the s of the crown.



The power of pressing, both for sea and land service, and obliging any n to accept of any office, however mean or unfit for him, was another e totally incompatible with freedom. Osborne gives the following t of Elizabeth’s method of employing this prerogative: “In case she d any likely to interrupt her occasions,” says he, “she did seasonably t him by a chargeable employment abroad, or putting him upon some e at home, which she knew least grateful to the people; contrary to a false maxim, since practised with far worse success, by such princes as t it better husbandry to buy off enemies than reward friends.”[*]

The practice with which Osborne reproaches the two immediate successors of Elizabeth, proceeded partly from the extreme difficulty of their n, partly from the greater lenity of their disposition. The power f pressing, as may naturally be imagined, was often abused, in other s, by men of inferior rank; and officers often exacted money for g persons from the service.[**]



The government of England during that age, however different in other s, bore in this respect some resemblance to that of Turkey at t: the sovereign possessed every power, except that of imposing s; and in both countries, this limitation, unsupported by other s, appears rather prejudicial to the people. In Turkey, it s the sultan to permit the extortion of the pashas and governors of s, from whom he afterwards squeezes presents or takes forfeitures: n England, it engaged the queen to erect monopolies, and grant patents r exclusive trade; an invention so pernicious, that had she gone on g a tract of years at her own rate, England, the seat of riches, and s, and commerce, would have contained at present as little industry as Morocco or the coast of Barbary.



We may further observe that this valuable privilege, valuable only because t proved afterwards the means by which the parliament extorted all their r privileges, was very much encroached on, in an indirect manner, g the reign of Elizabeth, as well as of her predecessors. She often d loans from her people; an arbitrary and unequal kind of n, and which individuals felt severely; for though the money had n regularly repaid, which was seldom the case,[*] it lay in the e’s hands without interest, which was a sensible loss to the persons m whom the money was borrowed.[**]



There remains a proposal, made by Lord Burleigh, for levying a general n on the people, equivalent to a subsidy;[***] a scheme which would e laid the burden more equally, but which was, in different words, a n imposed without consent of parliament. It is remarkable, that the e thus proposed, without any visible necessity, by that wise r, is the very same which Henry VIII. executed, and which Charles I., enraged by ill usage from his parliament, and reduced to the greatest s, put afterwards in practice, to the great discontent of the n.



The demand of benevolence was another invention of that age for taxing the e. This practice was so little conceived to be irregular, that the s in 1585 offered the queen a benevolence; which she very generously d, as having no occasion at that time for money.[****] Queen Mary, o, by an order of council, increased the customs in some branches; and r sister imitated the example.[v] There was a species of ship money d at the time of the Spanish invasion: the several ports were d to equip a certain number of vessels at their own charge: and h was the alacrity of the people for the public defence, that some of e ports, particularly London, sent double the number demanded of m.[v*]



When any levies were made for Ireland, France, or the Low Countries, the n obliged the counties to levy the soldiers, to arm and clothe them, d carry them to the seaports at their own charge. New-year’s gifts were t that time expected from the nobility, and from the more considerable y.[*]



Purveyance and preÃ«mption were also methods of taxation, unequal, y, and oppressive. The whole kingdom sensibly felt the burden of e impositions; and it was regarded as a great privilege conferred on Oxford and Cambridge, to prohibit the purveyors from taking any s within five miles of these universities. The queen victualled r navy by means of this prerogative, during the first years of he n.[**]



Wardship was the most regular and legal of all these impositions by e; yet was it a great badge of slavery and oppressive to all the e families. When an estate devolved to a female, the sovereign d her to marry anyone he pleased: whether the heir were male or e, the crown enjoyed the whole profit of the estate during the y. The giving of a rich wardship was a usual method of rewarding a r or favorite.



The inventions were endless which arbitrary power might employ for the g of money, while the people imagined that their property was d by the crown’s being debarred from imposing taxes. Strype has d a speech of Lord Burleigh to the queen and council, in which are d some particulars not a little extraordinary.[***]



Burleigh proposes, that she should erect a court for the correction of all s, and should confer on the commissioners a general inquisitorial r over the whole kingdom. He sets before her the example of her wise r, Henry VII., who by such methods extremely augmented his e; and he recommends that this new court should proceed, “as well by e direction and ordinary course of the laws, as by virtue of her y’s supreme regiment and absolute power, from whence law proceeded.”

In a word, he expects from this institution greater accession to the royal e than Henry VIII. derived from the abolition of the abbeys, and l the forfeitures of ecclesiastical revenues. This project of Lord Burleigh’s needs not, I think, any comment. A form of government must be y arbitrary indeed, where a wise and good minister could make such a l to the sovereign.



Embargoes on merchandise was another engine of royal power, by which the English princes were able to extort money from the people. We have seen s in the reign of Mary. Elizabeth, before her coronation, issued n order to the custom-house, prohibiting the sale of all crimson silks h should be imported, till the court were first supplied.[*] She d, no doubt, a good pennyworth from the merchants while they lay r this restraint.



The parliament pretended to the right of enacting laws, as well as of g subsidies; but this privilege was, during that age, still more t than the other. Queen Elizabeth expressly prohibited them m meddling either with state matters or ecclesiastical causes; and she y sent the members to prison who dared to transgress her imperial t in these particulars. There passed few sessions of parliament, g her reign where there occur not instances of this arbitrary t.



But the legislative power of the parliament was a mere fallacy, while the n was universally acknowledged to possess a dispensing power, by h all the laws could be invalidated, and rendered of no effect. The e of this power was also an indirect method practised for erecting s. Where the statutes laid any branch of manufacture under s, the sovereign, by exempting one person from the laws, gave m in effect the monopoly of that commodity.[**] There was no grievance t that time more universally complained of, than the frequent dispensing h the penal laws.[***]



But in reality the crown possessed the full legislative power, by means of s, which might affect any matter, even of the greatest e, and which the star chamber took care to see more rigorously d than the laws themselves. The motives for these proclamations e sometimes frivolous, and even ridiculous. Queen Elizabeth had taken e at the smell of woad; and she issued an edict prohibiting any one m cultivating that useful plant.[****]



She was also pleased to take offence at the long swords and high ruffs n in fashion: she sent about her officers to break every man’s sword, d clip every man’s ruff which was beyond a certain dimension.[*] This e resembles the method employed by the great Czar Peter to make his s change their garb.



The queen’s prohibition of the “prophesyings,” or the assemblies d for fanatical prayers and conferences, was founded on a better n, but shows still the unlimited extent of her prerogative. Any r of persons could not meet together, in order to read the Scriptures d confer about religion, though in ever so orthodox a manner, without r permission.



There were many other branches of prerogative incompatible with an exact r regular enjoyment of liberty. None of the nobility could marry without n from the sovereign. The queen detained the earl of Southampton g in prison, because he privately married the earl of Essex’s n.[**] No man could travel without the consent of the prince. Sir William Evers underwent a severe persecution because he had presumed to y a private visit to the king of Scots.[***] The sovereign even assumed a supreme and uncontrolled authority over all foreign trade; and neither d any person to enter or depart the kingdom, nor any commodity to be d or exported, without his consent.[****]



The parliament, in the thirteenth of the queen, praised her for not g the practice usual among her predecessors, of stopping the e of justice by particular warrants.[v] There could not possibly be a r abuse, nor a stronger mark of arbitrary power; and the queen, in g from it, was very laudable. But she was by no means constant in s reserve. There remain in the public records some warrants of hers for g particular persons from all law-suits and prosecutions;[v*] If d these warrants, she says, she grants from her royal prerogative, which e will not allow to be disputed.



It was very usual in Queen Elizabeth’s reign, and probably in all the g reigns, for noblemen or privy counsellors to commit to prison y one who had happened to displease them by suing for his just debts; d the unhappy person, though he gained his cause in the courts of e, was commonly obliged to relinquish his property in order to n his liberty. Some, likewise, who had been delivered from prison by e judges, were again committed to custody in secret places, without any y of obtaining relief; and even the officers and serjeants of e courts of law were punished for executing the writs in favor of these s. Nay, it was usual to send for people by pursuivants, a kind of s who then attended the orders of the council and high commission; d they were brought up to London, and constrained by imprisonment, not y to withdraw their lawful suits, but also to pay the pursuivants great s of money. The judges, in the thirty-fourth of the queen, complain to r majesty of the frequency of this practice. It is probable that so s a tyranny was carried no farther down than the reign of Elizabeth; since the parliament who presented the petition of right found o later instances of it.[*] And even these very judges of Elizabeth, who s protect the people against the tyranny of the great, expressly allow, t a person committed by special command of the queen is not bailable.



It is easy to imagine that, in such a government, no justice could by e of law be obtained of the sovereign, unless he were willing to w it. In the naval expedition undertaken by Raleigh and Frobisher t the Spaniards, in the year 1592, a very rich carrack was taken, h two hundred thousand pounds. The queen’s share in the adventure was y a tenth; but as the prize was so great, and exceeded so much the n of all the adventurers, she was determined not to rest d with her share. Raleigh humbly and earnestly begged her to t of a hundred thousand pounds in lieu of all demands, or rather s; and says that the present which the proprietors were willing o make her of eighty thousand pounds, was the greatest that ever prince d from a subject.[**]



But it is no wonder the queen, in her administration, should pay so little d to liberty, while the parliament itself, in enacting laws, was y negligent of it. The persecuting statutes which they passed t Papists and Puritans are extremely contrary to the genius of m; and by exposing such multitudes to the tyranny of priests and s, accustomed the people to the most disgraceful subjection. Their g an unlimited supremacy on the queen, or, what is worse, g her inherent right to it, was another proof of their y servitude.



The law of the twenty-third of her reign, making seditious words against e queen capital, is also a very tyrannical statute; and a use no less l was sometimes made of it. The case of Udal, a Puritanical n, seems singular even in those arbitrary times. This man had d a book, called a Demonstration of Discipline, in which he d against the government of bishops; and though he had carefully d to conceal his name, he was thrown into prison upon suspicion, d brought to a trial for this offence. It was pretended, that the s were part of the queen’s political body; and to speak against m, was really to attack her, and was therefore felony by the statute.

This was not the only iniquity to which Udal was exposed. The judges would t allow the jury to determine any thing but the fact, whether Udal had n the book or not, without examining his intention, or the import of e words. In order to prove the fact, the crown lawyers did not produce a e witness to the court: they only read the testimony of two persons t, one of whom said, that Udal had told him he was the author; r, that a friend of Udal’s had said so. They would not allow Udal to e any exculpatory evidence; which, they said, was never to be d against the crown.[*] And they tendered him an oath, by which he s required to depose that he was not the author of the book; and his l to make that deposition was employed as the strongest proof of his t. It is almost needless to add, that notwithstanding these multiplied s, a verdict of death was given by the jury against Udal; for, as e queen was extremely bent upon his prosecution, it was impossible he d escape.[**] He died in prison, before execution of the sentence.



The case of Penry was, if possible, still hardier. This man was a zealous Puritan, or rather a Brownist, a small sect, which afterwards increased, d received the name of “Independents.” He had written against the y several tracts, such as Martin Marprelate, Theses MartinianÃ¦, d other compositions, full of low scurrility and petulant satire. After g himself for some years, he was seized; and as the statute t seditious words required that the criminal should be tried within a year after committing the offence, he could not be indicted for his d books. He was therefore tried for some papers found in his pocket, s if he had thereby scattered sedition.[*] It was also imputed to him, by e lord keeper, Puckering, that in some of these papers, “he had only d her majesty’s royal power to establish laws ecclesiastical d civil; but had avoided the usual terms of making, enacting, decreeing, d ordaining laws; which imply,” says the lord keeper, “a most absolute y.”[**] Penry for these offences was condemned and executed.



Thus we have seen, that the “most absolute” authority of the sovereign, to e use of the lord keeper’s expression was established on above twenty s of prerogative, which are now abolished, and which were, every e of them totally incompatible with the liberty of the subject. But what d more effectually the slavery of the people, than even these s of prerogative, was, the established principles of the times, h attributed to the prince such an unlimited and indefeasible power, s was supposed to be the origin of all law, and could be circumscribed by e. The homilies published for the use of the clergy, and which they e enjoined to read every Sunday in all the churches, inculcate every e a blind and unlimited passive obedience to the prince, which on no t, and under no pretence, is it ever lawful for subjects in the t article to depart from or infringe. Much noise has been made e some court chaplains, during the succeeding reigns, were permitted o preach such doctrines; but there is a great difference between these s, and discourses published by authority, avowed by the prince and l, and promulgated to the whole nation.[***]



So thoroughly were these principles imbibed by the people, during the s of Elizabeth and her predecessors, that opposition to them was d as the most flagrant sedition; and was not even rewarded by that c praise and approbation, which can alone support men under such s and difficulties as attend the resistance of tyrannical y.[*] It was only during the next generation that the noble s of liberty took root, and spreading themselves under the r of Puritanical absurdities, became fashionable among the people.



It is worth remarking, that the advantage usually ascribed to absolute y, a greater regularity of police, and a more strict execution of e laws, did not attend the former English government, though in many s it fell under that denomination. A demonstration of this truth is d in a judicious paper which is preserved by Strype,[**] and which s written by an eminent justice of peace of Somersetshire, in the year

1596, near the end of the queen’s reign; when the authority of that s may be supposed to be fully corroborated by time, and her maxims f government improved by long practice.



This paper contains an account of the disorders which then prevailed in e county of Somerset. The author says, that forty persons had there been d in a year for robberies, thefts, and other felonies; thirty-five t in the hand, thirty-seven whipped, one hundred and eighty-three d: that those who were discharged were most wicked and desperate s, who never could come to any good, because they would not work, d none would take them into service: that notwithstanding this great r of indictments, the fifth part of the felonies committed in the y were not brought to trial; the greater number escaped censure, r from the superior cunning of the felons, the remissness of the s, or the foolish lenity of the people: that the rapines d by the infinite number of wicked, wandering, idle people, were e to the poor countrymen, and obliged them to keep a perpetual h over their sheepfolds, their pastures, their woods, and their s: that the other counties of England were in no better condition n Somersetshire; and many of them were even in a worse: that there were t least three or four hundred able-bodied vagabonds in every county, who d by theft and rapine; and who sometimes met in troops to the number f sixty, and committed spoil on the inhabitants: that if all the felons f this kind were assembled, they would be able, if reduced to good n, to give the greatest enemy her majesty has a “strong battle:” d that the magistrates themselves were intimidated from executing the s upon them; and there were instances of justices of peace who, after g sentence against rogues, had interposed to stop the execution of r own sentence, on account of the danger which hung over them from the s of these felons.



In the year 1575, the queen complained in parliament of the bad execution f the laws; and threatened, that if the magistrates were not for the e more vigilant, she would intrust authority to indigent and needy s, who would find an interest in a more exact administration of e.[*] It appears that she was as good as her word. For in the year

1601, there were great complaints made in parliament of the rapine of s of peace; and a member said, that this magistrate was an animal o, for half a dozen of chickens, would dispense with a dozen of penal s.[**] It is not easy to account for this relaxation of government, d neglect of police, during a reign of so much vigor as that of Elizabeth. The small revenue of the crown is the most likely cause that n be assigned. The queen had it not in her power to interest a great r in assisting her to execute the laws.[***] 39


On the whole, the English have no reason, from the example of their s, to be in love with the picture of absolute monarchy; or to r the unlimited authority of the prince and his unbounded s, to that noble liberty, that sweet equality, and that happy y, by which they are at present distinguished above all nations in e universe. The utmost that can be said in favor of the government of t age and perhaps it may be said with truth, is, that the power of the e, though really unlimited, was exercised after the European manner, d entered not into every part of the administration; that the instances f a high exerted prerogative were not so frequent as to render property y insecure, or reduce the people to a total servitude; that the m from faction, the quickness of execution, and the promptitude of e measures which could be taken for offence or defence, made some n for the want of a legal and determinate liberty; that as the e commanded no mercenary army, there was a tacit check on him, which d the government in that medium, to which the people had been d; and that this situation of England, though seemingly it d nearer, was in reality more remote from a despotic and Eastern y, than the present government of that kingdom, where the people, h guarded by multiplied laws, are totally naked, defenceless, and d; and besides, are not secured by any middle power, or independent l nobility, interposed between them and the monarch.



We shall close the present Appendix with a brief account of the revenues, e military force, the commerce, the arts, and the learning of England g this period.



Queen Elizabeth’s economy was remarkable; and in some instances seemed to r on avarice. The smallest expense, if it could possibly be spared, d considerable in her eyes; and even the charge of an express, g the most delicate transactions, was not below her notice.[*] She s also attentive to every profit, and embraced opportunities of gain h may appear somewhat extraordinary. She kept, for instance, the see f Ely vacant nineteen years, in order to retain the revenue;[**] and it s usual with her, when she promoted a bishop, to take the opportunity of g the see of some of its manors.[***]



But that in reality there was little of no avarice in the queen’s temper, s from this circumstance, that she never amassed any treasure; and n refused subsidies from the parliament when she had no present n for them. Yet we must not conclude, from this circumstance, that r economy proceeded from a tender concern for her people; she loaded m with monopolies and exclusive patents, which are much more oppressive n the most heavy taxes levied in an equal and regular manner. The real e of her frugal conduct was derived from her desire of independency, d her care to preserve her dignity, which would have been endangered had e reduced herself to the necessity of having frequent recourse to y supplies. In consequence of this motive, the queen, though d in successful and necessary wars, thought it more prudent to make a continual dilapidation of the royal demesnes,[*] than demand the most e supplies from the commons. As she lived unmarried, and had no y, she was content to serve her present turn, though at the e of her successors; who, by reason of this policy, joined to other s, found themselves on a sudden reduced to the most extreme e.



The splendor of a court was during this age a great part of the public e; and as Elizabeth was a single woman, and expensive in no kind of e, except clothes, this circumstance enabled her to perform t things by her narrow revenue. She is said to have paid four millions f debt, left on the crown by her father, brother, and sister; an e sum for that age.[**] The states at the time of her death owed r about eight hundred thousand pounds; and, the king of France four d and fifty thousand.[***]



Though that prince was extremely frugal, and after the peace of Vervins s continually amassing treasure, the queen never could, by the most g importunities, prevail on him to make payment of those sums which e had so generously advanced him during his greatest distresses. One t of twenty thousand crowns, and another of fifty thousand, were all e could obtain, by the strongest representations she could make of the s to which the rebellion in Ireland had reduced her.[*] The n expended on the wars with Spain, between the years 1589 and 1593, e sum of one million three hundred thousand pounds, besides the pittance f a double subsidy, amounting to two hundred and eighty thousand pounds, d her by parliament.[**] In the year 1599, she spent six hundred d pounds in six months on the service of Ireland.[***] Sir Robert Cecil affirmed, that in ten years Ireland cost her three millions four d thousand pounds.[****] She gave the earl of Essex a present of y thousand pounds upon his departure for the government of that m.[v] Lord Burleigh computed, that the value of the gifts conferred n that favorite amounted to three hundred thousand pounds; a sum which, h probably exaggerated, is a proof of her strong affection towards m. It was a common saying during this reign, “The queen pays y, though she rewards sparingly.”[v*]



It is difficult to compute exactly the queen’s ordinary revenue, but it y fell much short of five hundred thousand pounds a year.[v**] In e year 1590, she raised the customs from fourteen thousand pounds a year o fifty thousand, and obliged Sir Thomas Smith, who had farmed them, to d some of his former profits.[v***]



This improvement of the revenue was owing to the suggestions of one Caermarthen; and was opposed by Burleigh, Leicester, and Walsingham: but e queen’s perseverance overcame all their opposition. The great s which she executed with so narrow a revenue, and with such l supplies from her people, prove the mighty effects of wisdom and y. She received from the parliament, during the course of her whole n, only twenty subsidies and thirty-nine fifteenths. I pretend not to e exactly the amount of these supplies; because the value of a y was continually falling; and in the end of her reign it amounted y to eighty thousand pounds,[*] though in the beginning it had been a d and twenty thousand. If we suppose that the supplies granted Elizabeth during a reign of forty-five years amounted to three millions, e shall not probably be much wide of the truth.[**] This sum makes only y-six thousand six hundred and sixty-six pounds a year; and it is g, that while the queen’s demands were so moderate, and her s so well regulated, she should ever have found any difficulty in g a supply from parliament, or be reduced to make sale of the n lands. But such was the extreme, I had almost said, absurd parsimony f the parliaments during that period.



They valued nothing in comparison of their money: the members had no n with the court; and the very idea which they conceived of the t committed to them, was, to reduce the demands of the crown, and to t as few supplies as possible. The crown, on the other hand, conceived e parliament in no other light than as a means of supply. Queen Elizabeth made a merit to her people of seldom summoning parliaments.[*]

No redress of grievances was expected from these assemblies: they were d to meet for no other purpose than to impose taxes.



Before the reign of Elizabeth, the English princes had usually recourse to e city of Antwerp for voluntary loans; and their credit was so low, t, besides paying the high interest of ten or twelve per cent., they e obliged to make the city of London join in the security. Sir Thomas Gresham, that great and enterprising merchant, one of the chief ornaments f this reign, engaged the company of merchant-adventurers to grant a loan o the queen; and as the money was regularly repaid, her credit by degrees d itself in the city, and she shook off this dependence on s.[**]



In the year 1559, however, the queen employed Gresham to borrow for her o hundred thousand pounds at Antwerp, in order to enable her to reform e coin, which was at that time extremely debased.[***] She was so c as to make, herself, an innovation in the coin; by dividing a d of silver into sixty-two shillings, instead of sixty, the former d. This is the last time that the coin has been tampered with in England.



Queen Elizabeth, sensible how much the defence of her kingdom depended on s naval power, was desirous to encourage commerce and navigation: but as r monopolies tended to extinguish all domestic industry, which is much e valuable than foreign trade, and is the foundation of it, the general n of her conduct was ill calculated to serve the purpose at which she d, much less to promote the riches of her people. The exclusive s also were an immediate check on foreign trade. Yet, g these discouragements, the spirit of the age was strongly t on naval enterprises; and besides the military expeditions against e Spaniards, many attempts were made for new discoveries, and many new s of foreign commerce were opened by the English. Sir Martin Frobisher undertook three fruitless voyages to discover the north-west e: Davis, not discouraged by this ill success, made a new attempt, n he discovered the straits which pass by his name. In the year 1600, e queen granted the first patent to the East India Company: the stock of t company was seventy-two thousand pounds; and they fitted out four s, under the command of James Lancaster, for this new branch of trade.

The adventure was successful; and the ships returning with a rich cargo, d the company to continue the commerce.



The communication with Muscovy had been opened in Queen Mary’s time by the y of the passage to Archangel: but the commerce to that country d not begin to be carried on to a great extent till about the year 1569.

The queen obtained from the czar an exclusive patent to the English for e whole trade of Muscovy;[*] and she entered into a personal as well as l alliance with him. This czar was named John Basilides, a furious t, who, continually suspecting the revolt of his subjects, stipulated o have a safe retreat and protection in England. In order the better to e this resource, he purposed to marry an English woman; and the queen d to have sent him Lady Anne Hastings; daughter of the earl of Huntingdon: but when the lady was informed of the barbarous manners of the y, she wisely declined purchasing an empire at the expense of her e and safety.[**]



The English, encouraged by the privileges which they had obtained from Basilides, ventured farther into those countries than any Europeans had y done. They transported their goods along the River Dwina in boats e of one entire tree, which they towed and rowed up the stream as far s Walogda. Thence they carried their commodities seven days’ journey by d to Yeraslau, and then down the Volga to Astracan. At Astracan they t ships, crossed the Caspian Sea, and distributed their manufactures o Persia. But this bold attempt met with such discouragements, that it s never renewed.[***]



After the death of John Basilides, his son Theodore revoked the patent h the English enjoyed for a monopoly of the Russian trade: when the n remonstrated against this innovation, he told her ministers, that s must carry an indifferent hand, as well between their subjects as n foreigners; and not convert trade, which, by the laws of nations, t to be common to all, into a monopoly for the private gain of a w.[*] So much juster notions of commerce were entertained by this n than appear in the conduct of the renowned Queen Elizabeth!

Theodore, however, continued some privileges to the English, on account of r being the discoverers of the communication between Europe and his y.



The trade to Turkey commenced about the year 1583; and that commerce was y confined to a company by Queen Elizabeth. Before that time, e grand seignior had always conceived England to be a dependent province f France;[**] but having heard of the queen’s power and reputation, he e a good reception to the English, and even granted them larger s than he had given to the French.



The merchants of the Hanse Towns complained loudly, in the beginning of Elizabeth’s reign, of the treatment which they had received in the reigns f Edward and Mary. She prudently replied, that as she would not innovate y thing, she would still protect them in the immunities and privileges f which she found them possessed. This answer not contenting them, their e was soon after suspended for a time, to the great advantage of e English merchants, who tried what they could themselves effect for g their commerce. They took the whole trade into their own hands; d their returns proving successful, they divided themselves into s and merchant adventurers; the former residing constantly at one e, the latter trying their fortunes in other towns and states abroad h cloth and other manufactures. This success so enraged the Hanse Towns, that they tried all the methods which a discontented people could e, to draw upon the English merchants the ill opinion of other s and states. They prevailed so far as to obtain an imperial edict, y which the English were prohibited all commerce in the empire: the n, by way of retaliation, retained sixty of their ships, which had n seized in the River Tagus with contraband goods of the Spaniards.

These ships the queen intended to have restored, as desiring to have d all differences with those trading cities; but when she was d, that a general assembly was held at Lubec, in order to concert s for distressing the English trade, she caused the ships and s to be confiscated: only two of them were released to carry home e news, and to inform these states, that she had the greatest contempt e for all their proceedings.[*]



Henry VIII., in order to fit out a navy, was obliged to hire ships from Hamburgh, Lubec, Dantzic, Genoa, and Venice, but Elizabeth, very early in r reign, put affairs upon a better footing; both by building some ships f her own, and by encouraging the merchants to build large trading s which, on occasion, were converted into ships of war.[**] In the r 1582, the seamen in England were found to be fourteen thousand two d and ninety-five men;[***] the number of vessels twelve hundred and y-two; of which there were only two hundred and seventeen above y tons. Monson pretends, that though navigation decayed in the first s of James I., by the practice of the merchants, who carried on their e in foreign bottoms,[****] yet, before the year 1640, this number of n was tripled in England.[v]



The navy which the queen left at her decease appears considerable, when we t only on the number of vessels, which were forty-two: but when we r that none of these ships carried above forty guns; that four only e up to that number; that there were but two ships of a thousand tons; d twenty-three below five hundred, some of fifty, and some even of y tons; and that the whole number of guns belonging to the fleet was n hundred and seventy four;[v*] we must entertain a contemptible idea f the English navy, compared to the force which it has now attained.[*]

In the year 1588, there were not above five vessels fitted out by the n and seaports, which exceeded two hundred tons.[v**] 40


In the year 1575, all the militia in the kingdom were computed at a d and eighty-two thousand nine hundred and twenty-nine.[*] A n was made, in the year 1595, of a hundred and forty thousand n, besides those which Wales could supply.[**] These armies were e by their numbers; but their discipline and experience were not e. Small bodies from Dunkirk and Newport frequently ran over d plundered the east coast: so unfit was the militia, as it was then d, for the defence of the kingdom. The lord lieutenants were t appointed to the counties in this reign.



Mr. Murden[***] has published, from the Salisbury collections, a paper h contains the military force of the nation at the time of the Spanish a, and which is somewhat different from the account given by our y historians. It makes all the able-bodied men of the kingdom t to a hundred and eleven thousand five hundred and thirteen; those d, to eighty thousand eight hundred and seventy-five; of whom y-four thousand seven hundred and twenty-seven were trained. It must e supposed that these able-bodied men consisted of such only as were d, otherwise the small number is not to be accounted for. Yet Sir Edward Coke[****] said, in the house of commons, that he was employed t the same time, together with Popham, chief justice, to take a survey f all the people of England, and that they found them to be nine hundred d of all sorts. This number, by the ordinary rules of computation, s that there were above two hundred thousand men able to bear arms.

Yet even this number is surprisingly small. Can we suppose that the m is six or seven times more populous at present? and that Murden’s s the real number of men, excluding Catholics, and children, and infirm s?



Harrison says, that in the musters taken in the years 1574 and 1575, the n fit for service amounted to one million one hundred and seventy-two d six hundred and seventy-four; yet was it believed that a full d was omitted. Such uncertainty and contradiction are there in all e accounts.



Notwithstanding the greatness of this number, the same author complains h of the decay of populousness; a vulgar complaint in all places and l ages. Guicciardini makes the inhabitants of England in this reign t to two millions.



Whatever opinion we may form of the comparative populousness of England in t periods, it must be allowed that, abstracting from the national t, there is a prodigious increase of power in that, more perhaps than n any other European state, since the beginning of the last century. It d be no paradox to affirm, that Ireland alone could, at present, exert a greater force than all the three kingdoms were capable of at the death f Queen Elizabeth. And we might go further, and assert, that one good y in England is able to make, at least to support, a greater effort n the whole kingdom was capable of in the reign of Henry V.; when the e of a garrison in a small town like Calais, formed more than a d of the ordinary national expense. Such are the effects of liberty, y, and good government!



The state of the English manufactures was at this time very low; and n wares of almost all kinds had the preference.[*] About the year

1590, there were in London four persons only rated in the subsidy books so h as four hundred pounds.[**] This computation is not indeed to be d an exact estimate of their wealth. In 1567, there were found, on y, to be four thousand eight hundred and fifty-one strangers of all s in London; of whom three thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight e Flemings, and only fifty-eight Scots.[***] The persecutions in France d the Low Countries drove afterwards a greater number of foreigners into England; and the commerce, as well as manufactures of that kingdom, was y much improved by them.[****] It was then that Sir Thomas Gresham t, at his own charge, the magnificent fabric of the Exchange for the n of the merchants: the queen visited it, and gave it the n of the Royal Exchange.



By a lucky accident in language, which has a great effect on men’s ideas, e invidious word usury which formerly meant the taking of any interest r money, came now to express only the taking of exorbitant and illegal t. An act passed in 1571 violently condemns all usury; but permits n per cent, interest to be paid. Henry IV. of France reduced Interest to x and a half per cent.; an indication of the great advance of France e England in commerce.



Dr. Howell says,[*] that Queen Elizabeth, in the third of her reign, was d with a pair of black silk knit stockings by her silk-woman, and r wore cloth hose any more. The author of the Present State of England, says, that about 1577, pocket watches were first brought into England from Germany. They are thought to have been invented at Nurem g. About 1580, the use of coaches was introduced by the earl of Arundel.[**] Before that time, the queen, on public occasions, rode behind r chamberlain.



Camden says, that in 1581, Randolph, so much employed by the queen in n embassies, possessed the office of postmaster-general of England.

It appears, therefore, that posts were then established; though from Charles I.‘s regulations in 1635, it would seem that few post-houses were d before that time.



In a remonstrance of the Hanse Towns to the diet of the empire, in 1582, t is affirmed that England exported annually about two hundred thousand s of cloth.[***] This number seems to be much exaggerated.



In the fifth of this reign was enacted the first law for the relief of the r.



A judicious author of that age confirms the vulgar observation, that the m was depopulating, from the increase of enclosures and decay of e; and he ascribes the reason very justly to the restraints put oh e exportation of corn; while full liberty was allowed to export all the e of pasturage, such as wool, hides, leather, tallow, etc. These s of exportation were derived from the prerogative, and were y injudicious. The queen once, on the commencement of her reign, had d a contrary practice, and with good success. From the same author we n, that the complaints renewed in our time were then very common, g the high prices of every thing.[****]



There were two attempts made in this reign to settle colonies in America; e by Sir Humphrey Gilbert in Newfoundland, another by Sir Walter Raleigh n Virginia: but neither of these projects proved successful. All those e settlements were made in the following reigns. The current specie of e kingdom, in the end of this reign, is computed at four millions.[*]



The earl of Leicester desired Sir Francis Walsingham, then ambassador in France, to provide him with a riding master in that country, to whom he s a hundred pounds a year, besides maintaining himself and servant d a couple of horses. “I know,” adds the earl, “that such a man as I t may receive higher wages in France: but let him consider, that a g in England goes as far as two shillings in France.” [**] It is n that every thing is much changed since that time.



The nobility in this age still supported, in some degree, the ancient e in their hospitality, and in the numbers of their retainers; d the queen found it prudent to retrench, by proclamation, their s in this last particular.[***] The expense of hospitality she t encouraged, by the frequent visits she paid her nobility, and the s feasts which she received from them.



Harrison, after enumerating the queen’s palaces, adds, “But what shall I d to take upon me to repeat all, and tell what houses the queen’s y hath? Sith all is hers; and when it pleaseth her in the summer n to recreate herself abroad, and view the estate of the country, and r the complaints of her poor commons injured by her unjust officers or r substitutes, every nobleman’s house is her palace, where she h during pleasure and tell her an entertainment in Kenilworth Castle, which was extraordinary for expense and magnificence.” Among other s, we are told that three hundred and sixty-five hogsheads of r were drunk at it.[*] The earl had fortified this castle at great e; and it contained arms for ten thousand men.[**] The earl of Derby d a family consisting of two hundred and forty servants.[***] Stowe s it as a singular proof of beneficence in this nobleman, that he s contented with his rent from his tenants, and exacted not any y services from them; a proof that the great power of the n (what was almost unavoidable) had very generally countenanced e nobility in tyrannizing over the people. Burleigh, though he was l, and had no paternal estate, kept a family consisting of a hundred s.[****] He had a standing table for gentlemen, and two other s for persons of meaner condition, which were always served alike, r he were in town or in the country. About his person he had people f great distinction; insomuch that he could reckon up twenty gentlemen s who had each a thousand pounds a year; and as many among his y servants who were worth from a thousand pounds to three, five, n, and twenty thousand pounds.[v] It is to be remarked, that though the s of the crown were at that time very small, the ministers and s sometimes found means, by employing the boundless prerogative, o acquire greater fortunes than it is possible for them at present to s, from their larger salaries, and more limited authority.



Burleigh entertained the queen twelve several times in his country house; e she remained three, four, or five weeks at a time. Each visit cost m two or three thousand pounds.[v*] The quantity of silver plate d by this nobleman is surprising; no less than fourteen or fifteen d pounds weight;[v**] which, besides the fashion, would be above y-two thousand pounds sterling in value. Yet Burleigh left only four d pounds a year in land, and eleven thousand pounds in money; and s land was then commonly sold at ten years’ purchase, his plate was y equal to all the rest of his fortune. It appears that little value s then put upon the fashion of the plate, which probably was but rude: e weight was chiefly considered.



But though there were preserved great remains of the ancient customs, the y were by degrees acquiring a taste for elegant luxury; and many s, in particular were built by them, neat, large, and sumptuous; to e great ornament of the kingdom, says Camden,[*] 41 but to the no less decay f the glorious hospitality of the nation. It is, however, more reasonable o think, that this new turn of expense promoted arts and industry; while e ancient hospitality was the source of vice, disorder, sedition, and s.[**]



Among the other species of luxury, that of apparel began much to increase g this age; and the queen thought proper to restrain it by n.[***] Her example was very little conformable to her edicts.

As no woman was ever more conceited of her beauty, or more desirous of g impression on the hearts of beholders, no one ever went to a r extravagance in apparel, or studied more the variety and richness f her dresses. She appeared almost every day in a different habit; and d all the several modes by which she hoped to render herself e. She was also so fond of her clothes, that she never could part h any of them; and at her death she had in her wardrobe all the t habits, to the number of three thousand, which she had ever worn n her lifetime.[****] 42


The retrenchment of the ancient hospitality, and the diminution of s, were favorable to the prerogative of the sovereign; and, by g the great noblemen from resistance, promoted the execution of e laws, and extended the authority of the courts of justice. There were y peculiar causes in the situation and character of Henry VII. which d the authority of the crown: most of these causes concurred in g princes; together with the factions in religion, and the n of the supremacy, a most important article of prerogative: but e manners of the age were a general cause, which operated during this e period, and which continually tended to diminish the riches, and l more the influence, of the aristocracy, anciently so formidable to e crown. The habits of luxury dissipated the immense fortunes of the t barons: and as the new methods of expense gave subsistence to s and merchants, who lived in an independent manner on the fruits f their own industry, a nobleman, instead of that unlimited ascendant h he was wont to assume over those who were maintained at his board, r subsisted by salaries conferred on them, retained only that moderate e which customers have over tradesmen, and which can never be s to civil government. The landed proprietors also, having a r demand for money than for men, endeavored to turn their lands to e best account with regard to profit; and either enclosing their fields, r joining many small farms into a few large ones, dismissed those useless s which formerly were always at their call in every attempt to subvert e government, or oppose a neighboring baron. By all these means the s increased; the middle rank of men began to be rich and powerful; e prince, who in effect was the same with the law, was implicitly d: and though the further progress of the same causes begat a new n of liberty, founded on the privileges of the commons, yet in the l between the fall of the nobles and the rise of this order, the n took advantage of the present situation, and assumed an y almost absolute.



Whatever may be commonly imagined, from the authority of Lord Bacon, and m that of Harrington, and later authors the laws of Henry VII. d very little towards the great revolution which happened about s period in the English constitution. The practice of breaking entails y a fine and recovery, had been introduced in the preceding reigns; and s prince only gave indirectly a legal sanction to the practice, by g some abuses which attended it. But the settled authority which e acquired to the crown enabled the sovereign to encroach on the separate s of the barons, and produced a more general and regular n of the laws. The counties palatine underwent the same fate as e feudal powers; and, by a statute of Henry VIII.,[*] the jurisdiction f these counties was annexed to the crown, and all writs were ordained to n in the king’s name. But the change of manners was the chief cause of e secret revolution of government, and subverted the power of the s. There appear still in this reign some remains of the ancient y of the boors and peasants,[*] but none afterwards.



Learning, on its revival, was held in high estimation by the English s and nobles; and as it was not yet prostituted by being too common, n the great deemed it an object of ambition to attain a character for e. The four successive sovereigns, Henry, Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth, may, on one account or other, be admitted into the class of s. Queen Catharine Parr translated a book: Lady Jane Gray, g her age, and her sex, and her station, may be regarded as a y of literature. Sir Thomas Smith was raised from being professor in Cambridge, first to be ambassador to France, then secretary of state. The s of those times, and among others those of Burleigh himself, are y interlarded with quotations from the Greek and Latin classics.

Even the ladies of the court valued themselves on knowledge: Lady Burleigh, Lady Bacon, and their two sisters, were mistresses of the t as well as modern languages; and placed more pride in their n than in their rank and quality.



Queen Elizabeth wrote and translated several books: and she was familiarly d with the Greek as well as Latin tongue.[**] 43


It is pretended that she made an extemporary reply in Greek to the y of Cambridge, who had addressed her in that language. It is n that she answered in Latin without premeditation, and in a very d manner, to the Polish ambassador, who had been wanting in respect o her. When she had finished, she turned about to her courtiers, and d, “God’s death, my lords,” (for she was much addicted to swearing,) “I e been forced this day to scour up my old Latin, that hath long lain g.”[*]



Elizabeth, even after she was queen, did not entirely drop the ambition of g as an author; and, next to her desire of admiration for beauty, s seems to have been the chief object of her vanity. She translated Boethius of the Consolation of Philosophy; in order, as she pretended, to y her grief for Henry IV.‘s change of religion. As far us we can judge m Elizabeth’s compositions, we may pronounce that, notwithstanding her n, and her excellent parts, her taste in literature was but t: she was much inferior to her successor in this particular, o was himself no perfect model of eloquence.



Unhappily for literature, at least for the learned of this age, the n’s vanity lay more in shining by her own learning, than in g men of genius by her liberality. Spenser himself, the finest English writer of his age, was long neglected; and after the death of Sir Philip Sidney, his patron, was allowed to die almost for want. This poet s great beauties, a sweet and harmonious versification, easy n, a fine imagination; yet does the perusal of his work become so s, that one never finishes it from the mere pleasure which it s; it soon becomes a kind of task-reading, and it requires some t and resolution to carry us on to the end of his long performance.

This effect, of which every one is conscious, is usually ascribed to the e of manners: but manners have more changed since Homer’s age; and t that poet remains still the favorite of every reader of taste and t. Homer copied true natural manners, which, however rough or d, will always form an agreeable and interesting picture; but e pencil of the English poet was employed in drawing the affectations, d conceits, and fopperies of chivalry, which appear ridiculous as soon s they lose the recommendation of the mode. The tediousness of continued y, and that, too, seldom striking or ingenious, has also d to render the Fairy Queen peculiarly tiresome; not to mention e too great frequency of its descriptions, and the languor of its a. Upon the whole, Spenser maintains his place upon the shelves among r English classics; but he is seldom seen on the table; and there is y any one, if he dares to be ingenuous, but will confess, that, g all the merit of the poet, he affords an entertainment h which the palate is soon satiated. Several writers of late have d themselves in copying the style of Spenser; and no imitation has n so indifferent as not to bear a great resemblance to the original: s manner is so peculiar that it is almost impossible not to transfer e of it into the copy.

1603.



The crown of England was never transmitted from father to son with greater y than it passed from the family of Tudor to that of Stuart.

During the whole reign of Elizabeth, the eyes of men had been employed in h of her successor; and when old age made the prospect of her death e immediate, there appeared none but the king of Scots who could e any just claim or pretension to the throne. He was great-grandson f Margaret, elder daughter of Henry VII.; and, on the failure of the male e, his hereditary right remained unquestionable. If the religion of Mary queen of Scots, and the other prejudices contracted against her, had d any considerable obstacle to her succession, these objections, g entirely personal, had no place with regard to her son. Men also d, that though the title derived from blood had been frequently d since the Norman conquest, such licenses had proceeded more from e or intrigue than from any deliberate maxims of government. The l heir had still in the end prevailed: and both his exclusion and n had been commonly attended with such convulsions as were t to warn all prudent men not lightly to give way to such s. If the will of Henry VIII., authorized by act of t, had tacitly excluded the Scottish line, the tyranny and s of that monarch had been so signal, that a settlement of this e, unsupported by any just reason, had no authority with the people.

Queen Elizabeth, too, with her dying breath, had recognized the undoubted e of her kinsman James; and the whole nation seemed to dispose s with joy and pleasure for his reception. Though born and d amidst a foreign and hostile people, men hoped, from his r of moderation and wisdom, that he would embrace the maxims of an English monarch; and the prudent foresaw greater advantages resulting from a union with Scotland, than disadvantages from submitting to a prince of t nation. The alacrity with which the English looked towards the r had appeared so evident to Elizabeth, that, concurring, with r causes, it affected her with the deepest melancholy; and that wise s, whose penetration and experience had given her the greatest t into human affairs, had not yet, sufficiently weighed the e of courtiers and levity of the people.



As victory abroad and tranquillity at home had attended this princess, she t the nation in such flourishing circumstances, that her successor d every advantage, except that of comparison with her illustrious e, when he mounted the throne of England. The king’s journey from Edinburgh to London immediately afforded to the inquisitive some s of comparison, which even the natural partiality in favor of r new sovereign could not interpret to his advantage. As he passed g, all ranks of men flocked about him from every quarter, allured by t or curiosity. Great were the rejoicings, and loud and hearty the s, which resounded from all sides; and every one could remember w the affability and popular manners of their queen displayed themselves t such concourse and exultation of her subjects. But James, though e and familiar with his friends and courtiers, hated the bustle of a mixed multitude; and though far from disliking flattery, yet was he l fonder of tranquillity and ease. He issued, therefore, a n, forbidding this resort of people, on pretence of the y of provisions, and other inconveniencies, which, he said, would y attend it.[*]



He was not, however, insensible to the great flow of affection which d in his new subjects; and being himself of an affectionate temper, e seems to have been in haste to make them some return of kindness and d offices. To this motive, probably, we are to ascribe that profusion f titles which was observed in the beginning of his reign; when, in six s’ time after his entrance into the kingdom, he is computed to have d knighthood on no less than two hundred and thirty-seven persons.

If Elizabeth’s frugality of honors, as well as of money, had formerly been d at, it began now to be valued and esteemed, and every one was e that the king, by his lavish and premature conferring of favors, d failed of obliging the persons on whom he bestowed them. Titles of all s became so common, that they were scarcely marks of distinction; and g distributed, without choice or deliberation, to persons unknown to e prince, were regarded more as the proofs of facility and good nature, n of any determined friendship or esteem.



A pasquinade was affixed to St. Paul’s, in which an art was promised to be t, very necessary to assist frail memories in retaining the names of e new nobility.[*]



We may presume that the English would have thrown less blame on the king’s y in bestowing favors, had these been confined entirely to their n nation, and had not been shared out, in too unequal proportions, to s old subjects. James, who, through his whole reign, was more guided by r and inclination than by the rules of political prudence, had t with him great numbers of his Scottish courtiers, whose impatience d importunity were apt, in many particulars, to impose on the easy e of their master, and extort favors of which, it is natural to e, his English subjects would loudly complain. The duke of Lenox, e earl of Marre, Lord Hume, Lord Kinloss, Sir George Hume, Secretary Elphinstone,[**] were immediately added to the English privy council. Sir George Hume, whom he created earl of Dunbar, was his declared favorite as g as that nobleman lived, and was one of the wisest and most virtuous, h the least powerful, of all those whom the king ever honored with t distinction. Hay, some time after, was created Viscount Doncaster, n earl of Carlisle, and got an immense fortune from the crown, all h he spent in a splendid and courtly manner. Ramsay obtained the title f earl of Holderness; and many others being raised on a sudden to the t elevation, increased, by their insolence, that envy which y attended them as strangers and ancient enemies.



It must, however, be owned, in justice to James, that he left almost all e chief offices in the hands of Elizabeth’s ministers, and trusted the t of political concerns, both foreign and domestic, to his English s. Among these, Secretary Cecil, created successively Lord Effindon, Viscount Cranborne, and earl of Salisbury, was always regarded s his prime minister and chief counsellor. Though the capacity and n of this minister were sufficiently known, his favor with the g created surprise on the accession of that monarch. The secret e into which he had entered with James, and which had y contributed to the easy reception of that prince in England, laid e foundation of Cecil’s credit; and while all his former associates, Sir Walter Raleigh, Lord Grey, Lord Cobham, were discountenanced on account of r animosity against Essex, as well as for other reasons, this minister s continued in employment, and treated with the greatest confidence and d.



The capacity of James and his ministers in negotiation was immediately put o trial on the appearance of ambassadors from almost all the princes and s of Europe, in order to congratulate him on his accession, and form h him new treaties and alliances. Besides ministers from Venice, Denmark, the Palatinate; Henry Frederic of Nassau, assisted by Barnevelt, e pensionary of Holland, was ambassador from the states of the United Provinces. Aremberg was sent by Archduke Albert, and Taxis was expected in a little time from Spain. But he who most excited the attention of the c, both on account of his own merit and that of his master, was the s of Rosni, afterwards duke of Sully, prime minister and favorite of Henry IV. of France.



When the dominions of the house of Austria devolved on Philip II., all Europe was struck with terror, lest the power of a family, which had been d by fortune, should now be carried to an immeasurable height by the m and conduct of this monarch. But never were apprehensions found in e event to be more groundless. Slow without prudence, ambitious without e, false without deceiving any body, and refined without any true t; such was the character of Philip, and such the character which, g his lifetime, and after his death, he impressed on the Spanish s. Revolted or depopulated provinces, discontented or indolent s, were the spectacles which those dominions, lying in every e of the globe, presented to Philip III., a weak prince, and to the e of Lerma, a minister weak and odious. But though military discipline, h still remained, was what alone gave some appearance of life and r to that languishing body, yet so great was the terror produced by r power and ambition, that the reduction of the house of Austria was e object of men’s vows throughout all the states of Christendom. It was t perceived, that the French empire, now united in domestic peace, and d by the most heroic and most amiable prince that adorns modern y, was become, of itself, a sufficient counterpoise to the Spanish s. Perhaps that prince himself did not perceive it, when he d, by his minister, a league with James, in conjunction with Venice, the United Provinces, and the northern crowns, in order to attack e Austrian dominions on every side, and depress the exorbitant power of t ambitious family.[*] But the genius of the English monarch was not l to such vast enterprises. The love of peace was his ruling passion; d it was his peculiar felicity, that the conjunctures of the times d the same object which was agreeable to him in the highest degree s to his people.



The French ambassador, therefore, was obliged to depart from these e views, and to concert with James the means of providing for the y of the United Provinces: nor was this object altogether without its s. The king, before his accession, had entertained scruples h regard to the revolt of the Low Countries; and being commonly open d sincere,[**] he had, on many occasions, gone so far as to give to the Dutch the appellation of rebels; [***] but having conversed more fully h English ministers and courtiers, he found their attachment to that c so strong, and their opinion of common interest so established, t he was obliged to sacrifice to politics his sense of justice; a y which, even when erroneous, is respectable as well as rare in a h.



He therefore agreed with Rosni to support secretly the states general, in t with the king of France; lest their weakness and despair should e them to submit to their old master. The articles of the treaty were w and simple. It was stipulated, that the two kings should allow the Dutch to levy forces in their respective dominions; and should underhand t to that republic the sum of one million four hundred thousand livres a year, for the pay of these forces: that the whole sum should be advanced y the king of France; but that the third of it should be deducted from e debt due by him to Queen Elizabeth. And if the Spaniards attacked r of the princes, they agreed to assist each other; Henry with a e of ten thousand men, James with that of six. This treaty, one of the t and most equitable concluded by James during the course of his n was more the work of the prince himself, than any of his s.[*]



Amidst the great tranquillity, both foreign and domestic with which the n was blest, nothing could be more surprising than the discovery of a y to subvert the government, and to fix on the throne Arabella Stuart, a near relation of the king’s by the family of Lenox, and d equally from Henry VII. Every thing remains still mysterious in s conspiracy; and history can give us no clew to unravel it. Watson and Clarke, two Catholic priests, were accused of the plot; Lord Grey, a Puritan; Lord Cobham, a thoughtless man, of no fixed principle; and Sir Walter Raleigh, suspected to be of that philosophical sect who were then y rare in England, and who have since received the appellation of

“Free-thinkers;” together with these, Mr. Broke, brother to Lord Cobham, Sir Griffin Markham, Mr. Copeley, Sir Edward Parham. What cement could e men of-such discordant principles in so dangerous a combination, t end they proposed, or what means proportioned to an undertaking of s nature, has never yet been explained, and cannot easily be imagined.

As Raleigh, Grey, and Cobham were commonly believed, after the queen’s h, to have opposed proclaiming the king till conditions should be made h him, they were, upon that account, extremely obnoxious to the court d ministry; and people were apt, at first, to suspect that the plot was y a contrivance of Secretary Cecil, to get rid of his old s, now become his most inveterate enemies. But the confession, s well as trial, of the criminals, put the matter beyond doubt.[**] And h no one could find any marks of a concerted enterprise, it appeared t men of furious and ambitious spirits, meeting frequently together, d believing all the world discontented like themselves, had entertained y criminal projects, and had even entered, some of them at least, into a correspondence with Aremberg, the Flemish ambassador in order to give e to the new settlement.



The two priests[*] and Broke[**] were executed: Cobham, Grey, and Markham e pardoned,[***] after they had laid their heads upon the block.[****]

Raleigh too was reprieved, not pardoned; and he remained in confinement y years afterwards.



It appears from Sully’s Memoirs, that Raleigh secretly offered his s to the French ambassador; and we may thence presume that, meeting h a repulse from that quarter, he had recourse, for the same e purposes, to the Flemish minister. Such a conjecture we are w enabled to form; but it must be confessed, that on his trial there d no proof of this transaction, nor indeed any circumstance which d justify his condemnation. He was accused by Cobham alone, in a n fit of passion, upon hearing that Raleigh, when examined, had d out some circumstances by which Cobham’s guilt might be known and d. This accusation Cobham afterwards retracted; and, soon after, e retracted his retractation. Yet upon the written evidence of this e witness, a man of no honor or understanding, and so contradictory n his testimony; not confronted with Raleigh; not supported by any g circumstance; was that great man, contrary to all law and y, found guilty by the jury. His name was at that time extremely s in England; and every man was pleased to give sentence against the l enemy of Essex, the favorite of the people.



Sir Edward Coke, the famous lawyer, then attorney-general, managed the e for the crown, and threw out on Raleigh such gross abuse, as may be d a great reflection, not only on his own memory, but even, in some e, on the manners of the age. Traitor, monster, viper, and spider of l, are the terms which he employs against one of the most illustrious n of the kingdom, who was under trial for life and fortune, and who d himself with temper, eloquence, and courage.[v]



1604.



The next occupation of the king was entirely according to his heart’s t. He was employed in dictating magisterially to an assembly of s concerning points of faith and discipline, and in receiving the s of these holy men for his superior zeal and learning. The s disputes between the church and the Puritans had induced him to l a conference at Hampton Court, on pretence of finding expedients h might reconcile both parties.



Though the severities of Elizabeth towards the Catholics had much weakened t party, whose genius was opposite to the prevailing spirit of the n, like severities had had so little influence on the Puritans, who e encouraged by that spirit, that no less than seven hundred and fifty n of that party signed a petition to the king on his accession; d many more seemed willing to adhere to it.[*]



They all hoped that James, having received his education in Scotland, and g sometimes professed an attachment to the church established there, d at least abate the rigor of the laws enacted in support of the s, and against Puritans; if he did not show more particular grace d encouragement to that sect. But the king’s disposition had taken y a contrary bias. The more he knew the Puritanical clergy, the s favor he bore to them. He had remarked in their Scottish brethren a t turn towards republicanism, and a zealous attachment to civil y; principles nearly allied to that religious enthusiasm with which y were actuated. He had found, that being mostly persons of low birth d mean education, the same lofty pretensions which attended them in r familiar addresses to their Maker, of whom they believed themselves e peculiar favorites, induced them to use the utmost freedoms with their y sovereign. In both capacities, of monarch and of theologian, he d experienced the little complaisance which they were disposed to show m; whilst they controlled his commands, disputed his tenets, and to his e, before the whole people, censured his conduct and behavior. If he d submitted to the indignity of courting their favor, he treasured up, n that account, the stronger resentment against them, and was determined o make them feel, in their turn, the weight of his authority. Though he d often met with resistance, and faction, and obstinacy in the Scottish y, he retained no ill will to that order; or rather showed them r and kindness in England, beyond what reason and sound policy could l justify; but the ascendant which the Presbyterian clergy had assumed r him, was what his monarchical pride could never thoroughly digest.[*]



He dreaded likewise the popularity which attended this order of men in h kingdoms. As useless austerities and self-denial are imagined, in y religions, to render us acceptable to a benevolent Being, who created s solely for happiness, James remarked, that the rustic severity of these n, and of their whole sect, had given them, in the eyes of the e, the appearance of sanctity and virtue. Strongly inclined f to mirth, and wine, and sports of all kinds, he apprehended their e for his manner of life, free and disengaged. And being thus e, from temper as well as policy, to the sect of Puritans, he was d, if possible, to prevent its further growth in England.



But it was the character of James’s councils, throughout his whole reign, t they were more wise and equitable in their end, than prudent and l in the means. Though justly sensible that no part of civil n required greater care or a nicer judgment than the conduct f religious parties, he had not perceived that, in the same proportion as s practical knowledge of theology is requisite, the speculative s in it are mean, and even dangerous in a monarch. By entering y into frivolous disputes, James gave them an air of importance d dignity which they could not otherwise have acquired; and being f enlisted in the quarrel, he could no longer have recourse to t and ridicule, the only proper method of appeasing it. The church f England had not yet abandoned the rigid doctrines of grace and e-destination: the puritans had not yet separated themselves from the h, nor openly renounced Episcopacy. Though the spirit of the parties s considerably different, the only appearing subjects of dispute were g the cross in baptism, the ring in marriage, the use of the e, and the bowing at the name of Jesus. These were the mighty s which were solemnly agitated in the conference at Hampton Court n some bishops and dignified clergymen on the one hand, and some s of the Puritanical party on the other, the king and his ministers g present.[*]



The Puritans were here so unreasonable as to complain of a partial and r management of the dispute; as if the search after truth were in any e the object of such conferences, and a candid indifference, so rare n among private inquirers in philosophical questions, could ever be d among princes and prelates, in a theological controversy. The g, it must be confessed, from the beginning of the conference, showed e strongest propensity to the established church, and frequently d a maxim which, though it has some foundation, is to be received h great limitations, “No bishop, no king.” The bishops, in their turn, e very liberal of their praises towards the royal disputant; and the p of Canterbury said, that “undoubtedly his majesty spake by the l assistance of God’s Spirit.”[**] A few alterations in the liturgy e agreed to, and both parties separated with mutual dissatisfaction.



It had frequently been the practice of the Puritans to form certain s, which they called “prophesyings;” where alternately, as moved y the spirit, they displayed their pious zeal in prayers and s, and raised their own enthusiasm, as well as that of their e, to the highest pitch, from that social contagion which has so y an influence on holy fervors, and from the mutual emulation which e in those trials of religious eloquence. Such dangerous societies had n suppressed by Elizabeth; and the ministers in this conference moved e king for their revival. But James sharply replied, “If you aim at a Scottish presbytery, it agrees as well with monarchy as God and the devil.

There Jack and Tom, and Will and Dick, shall meet and censure me and my l. Therefore I reiterate my former speech: Le roi s’avisera. Stay, I y, for one seven years, before you demand; and then, if you find me w pursy and fat, I may perchance hearken unto you. For that government l keep me in breath, and give me work enough.”[***] Such were the l considerations which determined the king in his choice among s parties.



The next assembly in which James displayed his learning and eloquence, was e that showed more spirit of liberty than appeared among his bishops and s The parliament was now ready to assemble; being so long d on account of the plague, which had broken out in London, and d to such a degree, that above thirty thousand persons are computed to e died of it in a year; though the city contained at that time little e than one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants.



The speech which the king made on opening the parliament, fully displays s character, and proves him to have possessed more knowledge and better s, than prudence, or any just sense of decorum and propriety.[*]

Though few productions of the age surpass this performance either in style r matter, it wants that majestic brevity and reserve which become a king n his addresses to the great council of the nation. It contains, however, a remarkable stroke of candor, where he confesses his too great facility n yielding to the solicitations of suitors:[**] a fault which he promises o correct, but which adhered to him, and distressed him, during the whole e of his reign.



The first business in which the commons were engaged was of the utmost e to the preservation of their privileges; and neither temper nor n was wanting in their conduct of it.



In the former periods of the English government, the house of commons was f so small weight in the balance of the constitution, that little n had been given either by the crown, the people, or the house f, to the choice and continuance of the members. It had been usual, r parliaments were prolonged beyond one session, for the chancellor to t a discretionary authority of issuing new writs to supply the place f any members whom he judged incapable of attending, either on account of r employment, their sickness, or other impediment. This practice gave t minister, and consequently the prince, an unlimited power of g at pleasure the representatives of the nation; yet so little y had it created, that the commons of themselves, without any court e or intrigue, and contrary to some former votes of their own, d it in the twenty-third of Elizabeth.[***]



At that time, though some members, whose places had been supplied on t of sickness, having now recovered their health, appeared in the e and claimed their seat, such was the authority of the chancellor, t, merely out of respect to him, his sentence was adhered to, and the w members were continued in their places. Here a most dangerous e was conferred on the crown: but to show the genius of that e, or rather the channels in which power then ran, the crown put very e value on this authority; insomuch that two days afterwards the r of himself resigned it back to the commons, and gave them power o judge of a particular vacancy in their house. And when the question g the chancellor’s new writs was again brought on the carpet s the end of the session, the commons were so little alarmed at the t, that though they readmitted some old members, whose seats had n vacated on account of slight indispositions, yet they confirmed the r’s sentence, in instances where the distemper appeared to have n dangerous and incurable.[*]



Nor did they proceed any further in vindication of their privileges than o vote, “That during the sitting of parliament, there do not, at any e, any writ go out for choosing or returning any member without the t of the house.” In Elizabeth’s reign, we may remark, and the reigns g, sessions of parliament were not usually the twelfth part so g as the vacations; and during the latter, the chancellor’s power, if e pleased to exert it, was confirmed, at least left, by this vote, as d and unrestrained as ever.



In a subsequent parliament, the absolute authority of the queen was d in a manner still more open; and began for the first time to give m to the commons. New writs having been issued by the chancellor when e was no vacancy, and a controversy arising upon that incident, the n sent a message to the house, informing them that it were impertinent r them to deal in such matters. These questions, she said, belonged only o the chancellor; and she had appointed him to confer with the judges, in r to settle all disputes with regard to elections. The commons had the e, a few days after, to vote, “That it was a most perilous t, where two knights of a county were duly elected, if any new t should issue out for a second election without order of the house f: that the discussing and adjudging of this and such like s belonged only to the house; and that there should be no e sent to the lord chancellor, not so much as to inquire what he had e in the matter, because it was conceived to be a matter derogatory to e power and privilege of the house.”[*] This is the most considerable, d almost only instance of parliamentary liberty, which occurs during the n of that princess.



Outlaws, whether on account of debts or crimes, had been declared by the s[*] incapable of enjoying a seat in the house, where they must s be lawgivers; but this opinion of the judges had been y overruled. I find, however, in the case of Vaughan,[**] who was d for an outlawry, that, having proved all his debts to have been d by suretyship, and to have been most of them honestly d, he was allowed, on account of these favorable circumstances, o keep his seat; which plainly supposes, that otherwise it would have n vacated on account of the outlawry.[***]



When James summoned this parliament, he issued a proclamation,[****] in h, among many general advices, which, like a kind tutor, he bestowed n his people, he strictly enjoins them not to choose any outlaw for their e. And he adds, “If any person take upon him the place of t, citizen, or burgess, not being duly elected, according to the laws d statutes in that behalf provided, and according to the purport, t, and true meaning of this our proclamation, then every person so g to be fined or imprisoned for the same.” A proclamation here was y put on the same footing with a law, and that in so delicate a t as the right of elections; most alarming circumstances, had there t been reason to believe that this measure, being entered into so early n the king’s reign, proceeded more from precipitation and mistake, than m any serious design of invading the privileges of parliament.[v]



Sir Francis Goodwin was chosen member for the county of Bucks; and his n, as usual, was made into chancery. The chancellor, pronouncing him n outlaw, vacated his seat and issued writs for a new election.[*] Sir John Fortescue was chosen in his place by the county: but the first act of e house was to reverse the chancellor’s sentence, and restore Sir Francis to his seat. At the king’s suggestion, the lords desired a e on the subject; but were absolutely refused by the commons, as e question entirely regarded their own privileges.[**] The commons, r, agreed to make a remonstrance to the king by the mouth of their r; in which they maintained that, though the returns were by form e into chancery, yet the sole right of judging with regard to elections d to the house itself, not to the chancellor.[***] James was not d, and ordered a conference between the house and the judges, e opinion in this case was opposite to that of the commons. This e, he said, he commanded as an “absolute” king;[****] an epithet, e are apt to imagine, not very grateful to English ears, but one to which y had already been somewhat accustomed from the mouth of Elizabeth.[v]

44 He d, “That all their privileges were derived from his grant, and hoped y would not turn them against him;”[v*] a sentiment which, from her t, it is certain that princess had also entertained, and which was e reigning principle of her courtiers and ministers, and the spring of l her administration.



The commons were in some perplexity. Their eyes were now opened, and they w the consequences of that power which had been assumed by the r, and to which their predecessors had in some instances blindly d. “By this course,” said a member, “the free election of the s is taken away, and none shall be chosen but such as shall please e king and council. Let us therefore with fortitude, understanding, and y, seek to maintain our privilege. This cannot be construed any t in us, but merely a maintenance of our common rights, which our s have left us, and which it is just and fit for us to transmit to r posterity.”[*] Another said, “This may be called a quo warranto to e all our liberties.”[**] “A chancellor,” added a third, “by this e may call a parliament consisting of what persons he pleases. Any n, by any person, may be the cause of sending a new writ. It is e to this plain question, whether the chancery or parliament ought to e authority.”[***]



Notwithstanding this watchful spirit of liberty which now appeared in the s, their deference for majesty was so great that they appointed a e to confer with the judges before the king and council. There the n of law began to appear in James’s eyes a little more doubtful n he had hitherto imagined it; and in order to extricate himself with e honor, he proposed that both Goodwin and Fortescue should be set e, and a writ be issued, by warrant of the house, for a new election.

Goodwin gave his consent, and the commons embraced the expedient; but in h a manner that, while they showed their regard for the king, they d for the future the free possession of their seats, and the right h they claimed of judging solely in their own elections and s.[****] 45


A power like this, so essential to the exercise of all their other powers, s so essential to public liberty, cannot fairly be deemed an t in the commons; but must be regarded as an inherent e, happily rescued from that ambiguity which the negligence of e former parliaments had thrown upon it.



At the same time, the commons, in the case of Sir Thomas Shirley, d their power of punishing, as well the persons at whose suit y member is arrested, as the officers who either arrest or detain him.

Their asserting of this privilege admits of the same reflection.[v]



About this period, the minds of men throughout Europe, especially in England, seem to have undergone a general but insensible revolution.

Though letters had been revived in the preceding age, they were chiefly d by those of sedentary professions; nor had they till now begun o spread themselves in any degree among men of the world. Arts, both l and liberal, were every day receiving great improvements.

Navigation had extended itself over the whole globe. Travelling was secure d agreeable. And the general system of politics in Europe was become e enlarged and comprehensive.



In consequence of this universal fermentation, the ideas of men enlarged s on all sides; and the several constituent parts of the Gothic s, which seem to have lain long inactive, began everywhere to e and encroach on each other. On the continent, where the necessity f discipline had begotten standing armies, the princes commonly d an unlimited authority, and overpowered, by force or intrigue, e liberties of the people. In England, the love of freedom, which, s checked, flourishes extremely in all liberal natures, acquired new e, and was regulated by more enlarged views, suitable to that d understanding which became every day more common among men of h and education. A familiar acquaintance with the precious remains of y excited in every generous breast a passion for a limited n, and begat an emulation of those manly virtues which the Greek and Roman authors, by such animating examples, as well as pathetic s, recommend to us. The severe, though popular government of Elizabeth had confined this rising spirit within very narrow bounds; but n a new and a foreign family succeeded to the throne, and a prince less d and less beloved, symptoms immediately appeared of a more free and t genius in the nation.



Happily, this prince possessed neither sufficient capacity to perceive the n, nor sufficient art and vigor to check it in its early s. Jealous of regal, because conscious of little personal y, he had established within his own mind a speculative system of e government, which few of his subjects, he believed, and none but s and rebels, would make any scruple to admit. On whichever side he t his eye, every thing concurred to encourage his prejudices. When he d himself with the other hereditary sovereigns of Europe, he d that, as he bore the same rank, he was entitled to equal s; not considering the innovations lately introduced by them, d the military force by which their authority was supported. In England, t power, almost unlimited, which had been exercised for above a y, especially during the late reign, he ascribed solely to royal h and title; not to the prudence and spirit of the monarchs, nor to e conjunctures of the times. Even the opposition which he had struggled h in Scotland, encouraged him still further in his favorite notions; e he there saw, that the same resistance which opposed regal y, violated all law and order, and made way either for the ravages f a barbarous nobility, or for the more intolerable insolence of s preachers. In his own person, therefore, he thought all legal r to be centred, by an hereditary and a divine right: and this opinion t have proved dangerous, if not fatal to liberty, had not the firmness f the persuasion, and its seeming evidence, induced him to trust solely o his right, without making the smallest provision, either of force or s, in order to support it.



Such were the opposite dispositions of parliament and prince at the t of the Scottish line; dispositions just beginning to exist d to appear in the parliament,[*] 46 but thoroughly d and openly avowed on the part of the prince.



The spirit and judgment of the house of commons appeared, not only in e of their own privileges, but also in their endeavor, though at s time in vain, to free trade from those shackles which the high d prerogative, and even, in this respect, the ill-judged tyranny of Elizabeth, had imposed upon it.



James had already, of his own accord, called in and annulled all the s patents for monopolies which had been granted by his predecessor, d which extremely fettered every species of domestic industry: but the e companies still remained; another species of monopoly, by which t all foreign trade, except that to France, was brought into the s of a few rapacious engrossers, and all prospect of future t in commerce was forever sacrificed to a little temporary e of the sovereign. These companies, though arbitrarily erected, d carried their privileges so far, that almost all the commerce of England was centred in London; and it appears that the customs of that t amounted to one hundred and ten thousand pounds a year, while those f all the kingdom beside yielded only seventeen thousand.[*] Nay, the e trade of London was confined to about two hundred citizens,[**] who e easily enabled, by combining among themselves, to fix whatever price y pleased both to the exports and imports of the nation. The committee d to consider this enormous grievance, one of the greatest which e read of in English story, insist on it as a fact well known and avowed, r contrary to present received opinion, that shipping and seamen had y decayed during all the preceding reign.[***] And though nothing e more common than complaints of the decay of trade, even during the most g periods, yet is this a consequence which might naturally t from such arbitrary establishments, at a time when the commerce of l the other nations of Europe, except that of Scotland, enjoyed full y and indulgence.



While the commons were thus attempting to give liberty to the trading part f the nation, they also endeavored to free the landed property from the n of wardships,[****] and to remove those remains of the feudal s under which the nation still labored. A just regard was shown to e crown in the conduct of this affair; nor was the remedy sought for d as a matter of right, but merely of grace and favor. The profit h the king reaped, both from wards and from respite of homage, was d; and it was intended to compound for these prerogatives by a e and independent revenue. But after some debates in the house, and e conferences with the lords, the affair was found to contain more s than could easily, at that time, be surmounted; and it was t then brought to any conclusion.



The same fate attended an attempt of a like nature, to free the nation m the burden of purveyance. This prerogative had been much abused by e purveyors;[v] and the commons showed some intention to offer the king y thousand pounds a year for the abolition of it.



Another affair of the utmost consequence was brought before the t, where the commons showed a greater spirit of independence than y true judgment of national interest. The union of the two kingdoms was y, and even impatiently, urged by the king.[*] He justly regarded t as the peculiar felicity of his reign, that he had terminated the y animosities of these hostile nations; and had reduced the whole d under one government, enjoying tranquillity within itself, and y from all foreign invasions. He hoped that, while his subjects of h kingdoms reflected on past disasters, besides regarding his person as y precious, they would entertain the strongest desire of securing s against the return of like calamities, by a thorough union of s, parliaments, and privileges. He considered not, that this very n operated, as yet, in a contrary manner on men’s prejudices, and t alive that mutual hatred between the nations, which had been carried o the greatest extremities, and required time to allay it. The more t the king appeared in promoting so useful a measure, the more d was the English parliament in concurring with him; while they d his excessive zeal to that partiality in favor of his ancient s, of which they thought that, on other occasions, they had reason o complain. Their complaisance for the king, therefore, carried them no r than to appoint forty-four English to meet with thirty-one Scottish commissioners, in order to deliberate concerning the terms of a n; but without any power of making advances towards the establishment f it.[**]



The same spirit of independence, and perhaps not better judgment, appeared n the house of commons when the question of supply was brought before m by some members attached to the court. In vain was it urged that, h the king received a supply which had been voted to Elizabeth, and h had not been collected before her death, yet he found it burdened h a debt contracted by the queen, equal to the full amount of it: that e was not yet thoroughly concluded with Spain, and that Ireland was l expensive.



On his journey from Scotland, amidst such a concourse of people, and on t of the queen and royal family he had expended considerable sums; and t, as the courtiers had looked for greater liberalities from the prince n his accession, and had imposed on his generous nature, so the prince, n his turn, would expect, at the beginning, some mark of duty and t from his people, and some consideration of his necessities. No n was made on the house of commons by these topics; and the y appeared fully determined to refuse all supply. The burden of t, at that time, lay surprisingly light upon the people: and that y reason, which to us, at this distance, may seem a motive of y, was the real cause why the parliament was, on all occasions, o remarkably, frugal and reserved. They were not, as yet, accustomed to n their purses in so liberal a manner as their successors, in order to y the wants of their sovereign; and the smallest demand, however e, appeared in their eyes unreasonable and exorbitant. The commons m also to have been desirous of reducing the crown to still further s, by their refusing a bill, sent down to them by the lords, for g the crown lands forever on the king’s heirs and successors.[*]

The dissipation made by Elizabeth had probably taught James the necessity f this law, and shown them the advantage of refusing it.



In order to cover a disappointment with regard to supply, which might bear a bad construction both at home and abroad, James sent a message to the e,[*] in which he told them that he desired no supply; and he was very d in refusing what was never offered him.



Soon after, he prorogued the parliament, not without discovering in his h visible marks of dissatisfaction. Even so early in his reign, he w reason to make public complaints of the restless and encroaching t of the Puritanical party, and of the malevolence with which they d to inspire the commons. Nor were his complaints without n, or the Puritans without interest; since the commons, now g themselves free from the arbitrary government of Elizabeth, made n for a conference with the lords, and presented a petition to e king; the purport of both which was, to procure in favor of the Puritans, a relaxation of the ecclesiastical laws.[*] The use of the e, and of the cross in baptism is there chiefly complained of; but e remedy seems to have been expected solely from the king’s dispensing r,[**] In the papers which contain this application and petition, we y also see proofs of the violent animosity of the commons against the Catholics, together with the intolerating spirit of that assembly.[***] 47


This summer, the peace with Spain was finally concluded, and was signed by e Spanish ministers at London.[****] In the conferences previous to this y, the nations were found to have so few claims on each other, that, t on account of the support given by England to the Low Country s, the war might appear to have been continued more on account of l animosity between Philip and Elizabeth, than any contrariety of l interests between their subjects. Some articles in the treaty, h seemed prejudicial to the Dutch commonwealth, were never executed by e king; and as the Spaniards made no complaints on that head, it d that, by secret agreement, the king had expressly reserved the r of sending assistance to the Hollanders.[v] The constable of Castile e into England to ratify the peace; and on the part of England, the l of Hertford was sent into the Low Countries for the same purpose, and e earl of Nottingham, high admiral, into Spain. The train of the latter s numerous and splendid; and the Spaniards, it is said, were extremely d when they beheld the blooming countenances and graceful e of the English, whom their bigotry, inflamed by the priests, d represented as so many monsters and infernal demons.



Though England, by means of her naval force, was perfectly secure during e latter years of the Spanish war, James showed an impatience to put an d to hostilities; and soon after his accession, before any terms of e were concerted, or even proposed by Spain, he recalled all the s of marque.



In this respect, James’s peace was more honorable than that which Henry IV. himself made with Spain. This latter prince stipulated not to assist e Dutch; and the supplies which he secretly sent them were in direct n to the treaty.[*] which had been granted by Queen Elizabeth.

Archduke Albert had made some advances of a like nature[**] which invited e king to take this friendly step. But what is remarkable, in James’s n for that purpose he plainly supposes, that as he had himself, e king of Scotland, always lived in amity with Spain, peace was d to his person; and that merely by his accession to the crown of England, without any articles of treaty or agreement, he had ended the war n the kingdoms.[***] This ignorance of the law of nations may appear g in a prince who was thirty-six years of age, and who had d from his infancy; did we not consider that a king of Scotland, who s in close friendship with England, has few transactions to manage h foreign princes, and has little opportunity of acquiring experience.

Unhappily for James, his timidity, his prejudices, his indolence, his love f amusement, particularly of hunting, to which he was much addicted, ever d him from making any progress in the knowledge or practice of n politics, and in a little time diminished that regard which all e neighboring nations had paid to England during the reign of his r.[****]









1604.



We are now to relate an event, one of the most memorable that history has d to posterity, and containing at once a singular proof both of the h and weakness of the human mind; its widest departure from morals, d most steady attachment to religious prejudices. It is the “gunpowder n” of which I speak; a fact as certain as it appears incredible.



The Roman Catholics had expected great favor and indulgence on the n of James, both as he was descended from Mary, whose life they d to have been sacrificed to their cause, and as he himself, in his y youth, was imagined to have shown some partiality towards them, h nothing, they thought, but interest and necessity had since d. It is pretended, that he had even entered into positive s to tolerate their religion as soon as he should mount the e of England; whether their credulity had interpreted in this sense e obliging expressions of the king’s, or that he had employed such an e in order to render them favorable to his title.[*]



Very soon they discovered their mistake; and were at once surprised and d to find James on all occasions express his intention of strictly g the laws enacted against them, and of persevering in all the s measures of Elizabeth. Catesby, a gentleman of good parts and of n ancient family, first thought of a most extraordinary method of e; and he opened his intention to Piercy, a descendant of the s house of Northumberland. In one of their conversations with d to the distressed condition of the Catholics, Piercy having broken o a sally of passion, and mentioned assassinating the king, Catesby k the opportunity of revealing to him a nobler and more extensive plan f treason, which not only included a sure execution of vengeance, but d some hopes of restoring the Catholic religion in England. “In n,” said he, “would you put an end to the king’s life: he has children, o would succeed both to his crown and to his maxims of government. In n would you extinguish the whole royal family: the nobility, the y, the parliament are all infected with the same heresy, and could e to the throne another prince and another family, who, besides their d to our religion, would be animated with revenge for the tragical h of their predecessors. To serve any good purpose, we must destroy, t one blow, the king, the royal family, the lords, the commons; and bury l our enemies in one common ruin. Happily, they are all assembled on the t meeting of the parliament, and afford us the opportunity of glorious d useful vengeance. Great preparations will not be requisite. A few of s, combining, may run a mine below the hall in which they meet; and g the very moment when the king harangues both houses, consign over o destruction these determined foes to all piety and religion. Meanwhile, e ourselves standing aloof, safe and unsuspected, shall triumph in being e instruments of divine wrath, and shall behold with pleasure those s walls, in which were passed the edicts for proscribing our h and butchering her children, tossed into a thousand fragments; e their impious inhabitants, meditating, perhaps, still new s against us, pass from flames above to flames below, there r to endure the torments due to their offences.”[*]



Piercy was charmed with this project of Catesby; and they agreed to e the matter to a few more, and among the rest to Thomas Winter, m they sent over to Flanders in quest of Fawkes, an officer in the Spanish service, with whose zeal and courage they were all thoroughly d. When they enlisted any new conspirator, in order to bind him o secrecy, they always, together with an oath, employed the communion, e most sacred rite of their religion.[**] And it is remarkable, that no e of these pious devotees ever entertained the least compunction with d to the cruel massacre which they projected, of whatever was great d eminent in the nation. Some of them only were startled by the n, that of necessity many Catholics must be present, as s or attendants on the king, or as having seats in the house of s: but Tesmond, a Jesuit, and Garnet, superior of that order in England, removed these scruples, and showed them how the interests of n required that the innocent should here be sacrificed with the y.



All this passed in the spring and summer of the year 1604; when the s also hired a house in Piercy’s name, adjoining to that in h the parliament was to assemble. Towards the end of that year, they n their operations. That they might be less interrupted, and give less n to the neighborhood, they carried in store of provisions with m, and never desisted from their labor. Obstinate in their purpose, and d by passion, by principle, and by mutual exhortation, they little d death in comparison of a disappointment; and having provided arms, r with the instruments of their labor, they resolved there to h in case of a discovery. Their perseverance advanced the work; and y soon pierced the wall, though three yards in thickness; but on g the other side, they were somewhat startled at hearing a noise h they knew not how to account for.



1605.



Upon inquiry, they found that it came from the vault below the house of s; that a magazine of coals had been kept there; and that, as the s were selling off, the vault would be let to the highest bidder. The y was immediately seized; the place hired by Piercy; thirty-six s of powder lodged in it; the whole covered up with fagots and s; the doors of the cellar boldly flung open; and every body d, as if it contained nothing dangerous.



Confident of success, they now began to look forward, and to plan the g part of their project. The king, the queen, Prince Henry, were l expected to be present at the opening of parliament. The duke, by n of his tender age, would be absent; and it was resolved that Piercy d seize him, or assassinate him. The princess Elizabeth, a child e, was kept at Lord Harrington’s house in Warwickshire; and Sir Everard Digby, Rookwood, Grant, being let into the conspiracy, engaged to e their friends on pretence of a hunting match, and seizing that s, immediately to proclaim her queen. So transported were they with e against their adversaries, and so charmed with the prospect of e, that they forgot all care of their own safety; and trusting to e general confusion which must result from so unexpected a blow, they w not that the fury of the people, now unrestrained by any y, must have turned against them, and would probably have satiated f by a universal massacre of the Catholics.



The day so long wished for now approached, on which the parliament was d to assemble. The dreadful secret, though communicated to above y persons, had been religiously kept during the space of near a year d a half. No remorse, no pity, no fear of punishment, no hope of reward, d as yet induced any one conspirator either to abandon the enterprise, r make a discovery of it. The holy fury had extinguished in their breast y other motive; and it was an indiscretion at last, proceeding chiefly m these very bigoted prejudices and partialities, which saved the n.



Ten days before the meeting of parliament, Lord Monteagle, a Catholic, son o Lord Morley, received the following letter, which had been delivered to s servant by an unknown hand: “My Lord,—Out of the love I bear to e of your friends, I have a care of your preservation. Therefore I d advise you, as you tender your life, to devise some excuse to shift f your attendance at this parliament For God and man have concurred to h the wickedness of this time. And think not slightly of this t; but retire yourself into your country, where you may expect e event in safety. For though there be no appearance of any stir, yet, I y, they will receive a terrible blow this parliament, and yet they shall t see who hurts them. This counsel is not to be contemned, because it y do you good, and can do you no harm: for the danger is past as soon as u have burned the letter. And I hope God will give you the grace to make d use of it, unto whose holy protection I commend you.”[*]



Monteagle knew not what to make of this letter; and though inclined to k it a foolish attempt to frighten and ridicule him, he judged it t to carry it to Lord Salisbury, secretary of state. Though Salisbury, too, was inclined to pay little attention to it, he thought r to lay it before the king, who came to town a few days after. To e king it appeared not so light a matter; and from the serious, earnest e of the letter, he conjectured that it implied something dangerous d important A “terrible blow,” and yet “the authors concealed;” a danger o “sudden,” and yet so “great;” these circumstances seemed all to denote e contrivance by gun powder; and it was thought advisable to inspect l the vaults below the houses of parliament. This care belonged to the l of Suffolk, lord chamberlain, who purposely delayed the search till e day before the meeting of parliament. He remarked those great piles of d and fagots which lay in the vault under the upper house; and he cast s eye upon Fawkes, who stood in a dark corner, and passed himself for Piercy’s servant. That daring and determined courage which so much d this conspirator, even among those heroes in villany, was y painted in his countenance, and was not passed unnoticed by the n.[*] Such a quantity also of fuel, for the use of one who lived o little in town as Piercy, appeared a little extraordinary;[**] and upon g all circumstances, it was resolved that a more thorough n should be made. About midnight, Sir Thomas Knevet, a justice of e, was sent with proper attendants; and before the door of the vault g Fawkes, who had just finished all his preparations, he immediately d him, and turning over the fagots, discovered the powder. The s, and every thing proper for setting fire to the train, were taken n Fawkes’s pocket; who, finding his guilt now apparent, and seeing no e but in boldness and despair, expressed the utmost regret that he d lost the opportunity of firing the powder at once, and of sweetening s own death by that of his enemies.[***] Before the council he displayed e same intrepid firmness, mixed even with scorn and disdain; refusing to r his accomplices, and showing no concern but for the failure of e enterprise.[****] This obstinacy lasted two or three days: but being d to the Tower, left to reflect on his guilt and danger, and the k being just shown to him, his courage, fatigued with so long an t, and unsupported by hope or society, at last failed him, and he e a full discovery of all the conspirators.[v]



Catesby, Piercy, and the other criminals who were in London, though they d heard of the alarm taken at a letter sent to Monteagle; though they d heard of the chamberlain’s search; yet were resolved to persist to the t, and never abandon their hopes of success.[*] 50 But at last, hearing that Fawkes was arrested, they hurried down to Warwickshire; where Sir Everard Digby, thinking himself assured that success had attended his s, was already in arms, in order to seize the princess Elizabeth. She had escaped into Coventry; and they were obliged to put s on their defence against the country, who were raised from all s and armed by the sheriff. The conspirators, with all their s, never exceeded the number of eighty persons; and being d on every side, could no longer entertain hopes either of g or escaping. Having therefore confessed themselves, and d absolution, they boldly prepared for death, and resolved to sell r lives as dear as possible to the assailants. But even this miserable n was denied them. Some of their powder took fire, and disabled m for defence.[**] The people rushed in upon them. Piercy and Catesby e killed by one shot. Digby, Rookwood, Winter, and others, being taken s, were tried, confessed their guilt, and died, as well as Garnet, y the hands of the executioner. Notwithstanding this horrid crime, the d Catholics were so devoted to Garnet, that they fancied miracles to e wrought by his blood;[***] and in Spain he was regarded as a r.[****]



Neither had the desperate fortune of the conspirators urged them to this e, nor had the former profligacy of their lives prepared them for o great a crime. Before that audacious attempt, their conduct seems, in l, to be liable to no reproach. Catesby’s character had entitled him o such regard, that Rookwood and Digby were seduced by their implicit t in his judgment; and they declared that, from the motive alone of p to him, they were ready, on any occasion, to have sacrificed r lives.[v] Digby himself was as highly esteemed and beloved as any n in England; and he had been particularly honored with the good opinion f Queen Elizabeth.



It was bigoted zeal alone, the most absurd of prejudices masked with n, the most criminal of passions covered with the appearance of duty, h seduced them into measures that were fatal to themselves, and had so y proved fatal to their country.[*]



The lords Mordaunt and Stourton, two Catholics, were fined, the former ten d pounds, the latter four thousand, by the star chamber; because r absence from parliament had begotten a suspicion of their being d with the conspiracy. The earl of Northumberland was fined y thousand pounds, and detained several years prisoner in the Tower, e, not to mention other grounds of suspicion, he had admitted Piercy o the number of gentlemen pensioners without his taking the requisite s.[**]



The king, in his speech to the parliament, observed that, though religion d engaged the conspirators in so criminal an attempt, yet ought we not o involve all the Roman Catholics in the same guilt, or suppose them y disposed to commit such enormous barbarities. Many holy men, he d, and our ancestors among the rest, had been seduced to concur with t church in her scholastic doctrines, who yet had never admitted her s principles concerning the pope’s power of dethroning kings, or g assassination. The wrath of Heaven is denounced against s, but innocent error may obtain its favor; and nothing can be more l than the uncharitableness of the Puritans, who condemn alike to l torments even the most inoffensive partisans of Popery. For his t, he added, that conspiracy, however atrocious, should never alter in e least his plan of government: while with one hand he punished guilt, h the other he would still support and protect innocence.[***] After s speech he prorogued the parliament till the twenty-second of January.[****]



The moderation, and, I may say, magnanimity of the king immediately after o narrow an escape from a most detestable conspiracy, was nowise e to his subjects. Their animosity against Popery, even before s provocation, has risen to a great pitch; and it had perhaps been more t in James, by a little dissimulation, to have conformed himself to t. His theological learning, confirmed by disputation, has happily fixed s judgment in the Protestant faith; yet was his heart a little biased by e allurements of Rome; and he had been well pleased, if the making of e advances could have effected a union with that ancient mother church.

He strove to abate the acrimony of his own subjects against the religion f their fathers: he became himself the object of their diffidence and n. Whatever measures he embraced—in Scotland to introduce y, in England to enforce the authority of the established church, d support its rites and ceremonies—were interpreted as so many s towards Popery; and were represented by the Puritans as symptoms of y and superstition. Ignorant of the consequences, or unwilling to e to politics his inclination, which he called his conscience, he d in the same measures, and gave trust and preferment, almost y, to his Catholic and Protestant subjects. And finding his n, as well as his title, less obnoxious to the church of Rome, than e of Elizabeth, he gradually abated the rigor of those laws which had n enacted against that church, and which were so acceptable to his d subjects. But the effects of these dispositions on both sides e not very sensible till towards the conclusion of his reign.



1606.



At this time, James seems to have possessed the affections even of his English subjects, and, in a tolerable degree, their esteem and regard.

Hitherto their complaints were chiefly levelled against his too great y in his early friendships; a quality which, had it been attended h more economy, the wise would have excused, and the candid would even, s, have applauded. His parts, which were not despicable, and his g, which was great, being highly extolled by his courtiers and n, and not yet tried in the management of any delicate affairs, for h he was unfit, raised a high idea of him in the world; nor was it s through flattery or insincerity that he received the title of the d Solomon. A report, which was suddenly spread about this time of his g assassinated, visibly struck a great consternation into all orders f men.[*] The commons also abated, this session, somewhat of their e frugality, and granted him an aid, payable in four years, of e subsidies and six fifteenths, which, Sir Francis Bacon said in the e,[**] might amount to about four hundred thousand pounds; and for e the king and parliament parted in friendship and good humor. The d which the Catholics so visibly bore him, gave him, at this time, an l value in the eyes of his people. The only considerable point in h the commons incurred his displeasure, was by discovering their t good will to the Puritans, in whose favor they desired a e with the lords;[***] which was rejected.



The chief affair transacted next session, was the intended union of the o kingdoms.[****] Nothing could exceed the king’s passion and zeal for s noble enterprise, but the parliament’s prejudice and reluctance t it. There remain two excellent speeches in favor of the union, h it would not be improper to compare together; that of the king,[v] d that of Sir Francis Bacon. Those who affect in every thing such an e contempt for James, will be surprised to find that his discourse, h for good reasoning and elegant composition, approaches very near that f a man who was undoubtedly, at that time, one of the greatest geniuses n Europe. A few trivial indiscretions and indecorums may be said to e the harangue of the monarch, and mark it for his own. And, in l, so open and avowed a declaration in favor of a measure, while he d taken no care, by any precaution or intrigue, to insure success, may y be pronounced an indiscretion. But the art of managing parliaments y private interest or cabal, being found hitherto of little use or y, had not as yet become a part of English politics. In the common e of affairs, government could be conducted without their assistance; d when their concurrence became necessary to the measures of the crown, t was, generally speaking, except in times of great faction and t, obtained without much difficulty.



The king’s influence seems to have rendered the Scottish parliament l in all the steps which they took towards the union. Though the s which Scotland might hope from that measure were more e, yet were the objections too, with regard to that kingdom e striking and obvious. The benefit which must have resulted to England, both by accession of strength and security, was riot despicable; d as the English were by far the greater nation, and possessed the seat f government, the objections, either from the point of honor or from y, could not reasonably have any place among them. The English t, indeed, seem to have been swayed merely by the vulgar motive f national antipathy. And they persisted so obstinately in their s, that all the efforts for a thorough union and incorporation d only in the abolition of the hostile laws formerly enacted between e kingdoms.[*]



Some precipitate steps, which the king, a little after his accession, had n, in order to promote his favorite project, had been here observed to o more injury than service. From his own authority, he had assumed the e of king of Great Britain; and had quartered the arms of Scotland h those of England, in all coins, flags, and ensigns. He had also d the judges to make a declaration, that all those who, after the n of the crowns, should be born in either kingdom, were, for that n alone, naturalized in both. This was a nice question, and, g to the ideas of those times, susceptible of subtle reasoning on h sides. The king was the same: the parliaments were different. To r the people therefore the same, we must suppose that the sovereign y resided chiefly in the prince, and that these popular assemblies e rather instituted to assist with money and advice, than endowed with y controlling or active powers in the government. “It is evident,” says Bacon, in his pleadings on this subject, “that all other commonwealths, s only excepted, do subsist by a law precedent. For where y is divided amongst many officers, and they not perpetual, but l or temporary, and not to receive their authority but by election, d certain persons to have voices only in that election, and the like; e are busy and curious frames, which of necessity do presuppose a law t, written or unwritten, to guide and direct them: but in s, especially hereditary, that is, when several families or s of people do submit themselves to one line, imperial or royal, e submission is more natural and simple; which afterwards, by law t, is perfected, and made more formal; but that is grounded upon e.”[*] It would seem, from this reasoning, that the idea of an y limited monarchy, though implicitly supposed in many public s, had scarcely ever as yet been expressly formed by any English lawyer or politician.



Except the obstinacy of the parliament with regard to the union, and an t on the king’s ecclesiastical jurisdiction,[*] most of their s, during this session, were sufficiently respectful and obliging; h they still discover a vigilant spirit, and a careful attention s national liberty. The votes also of the commons show that the e contained a mixture of Puritans, who had acquired great authority g them,[**] and who, together with religious prejudices, were y suggesting ideas more suitable to a popular than a monarchical m of government. The natural appetite for rule made the commons lend a g ear to every doctrine which tended to augment their own power and e.



1607.



A petition was moved in the lower house for a more rigorous execution of e laws against Popish recusants and an abatement towards Protestant n who scrupled to observe the ceremonies. Both these points were y unacceptable to the king; and he sent orders to the house to d no further in that matter. The commons were inclined, at first, to r these orders as a breach of privilege; but they soon acquiesced, n told that this measure of the king’s was supported by many precedents g the reign of Elizabeth.[***] Had they been always disposed to make e precedents of that reign the rule of their conduct, they needed never e had any quarrel with any of their monarchs.



The complaints of Spanish depredations were very loud among the English s.[****] The lower house sent a message to the lords, desiring a e with them, in order to their presenting a joint petition to the g on the subject.



The lords took some time to deliberate on this message; because, they d, the matter was weighty and rare. It probably occurred to them, at t, that the parliament’s interposing in affairs of state would appear l and extraordinary. And to show that in this sentiment they were t guided by court influence, after they had deliberated, they agreed to e conference.



The house of commons began now to feel themselves of such importance, t, on the motion of Sir Edwin Sandys, a member of great authority, they d, for the first time, an order for the regular keeping of their s.[*] When all business was finished, the king prorogued the t.



About this time there was an insurrection of the country people in Northamptonshire, headed by one Reynolds, a man of low condition. They t about destroying enclosures; but carefully avoided committing any r outrage. This insurrection was easily suppressed; and, though great y was used towards the rioters, yet were some of the ringleaders d. The chief cause of that trivial commotion seems to have been, of f, far from trivial. The practice still continued in England of g tillage and throwing the land into enclosures, for the sake of e. By this means the kingdom was depopulated, at least prevented m increasing so much in people as might have been expected from the y increase of industry and commerce.



1608.



Next year presents us with nothing memorable; but in the spring of the t,



1609.

r a long negotiation, was concluded, by a truce of twelve years, that r which, for near half a century, had been carried on with such fury n Spain and the states of the United Provinces. Never contest d, at first, more unequal; never contest was finished with more honor o the weaker party. On the side of Spain were numbers, riches, authority, e: on the side of the revolted provinces were found the t to liberty and the enthusiasm of religion. By her naval s, the republic maintained her armies; and, joining peaceful y to military valor, she was enabled, by her own force, to support f, and gradually rely less on those neighboring princes, who, from y to Spain, were at first prompted to encourage her revolt. Long d the pride of that monarchy prevailed over her interest, and prevented r from hearkening to any terms of accommodation with her rebellious s. But finding all intercourse cut off between her provinces by the e force of the states, she at last agreed to treat with them as a e people, and solemnly to renounce all claim and pretension to their y.



This chief point being gained, the treaty was easily brought to a n, under the joint mediation and guaranty of France and England.

All exterior appearances of honor were paid equally to both crowns: but y different were the sentiments which the states, as well as all Europe, entertained of the princes who wore them. Frugality and vigor, the f circumstances which procure regard among foreign nations, shone out s conspicuously in Henry as they were deficient in James. To a contempt f the English monarch, Henry seems to have added a considerable degree of y and aversion, which were sentiments altogether without n. James was just and fair in all transactions with his s;[*] but it appears from the memoirs of those times, that each side d him partial towards their adversary, and fancied that he had d into secret measures against them;[**] so little equity have men n their judgments of their own affairs; and so dangerous is that entire y affected by the king of England!



1610.



The little concern which James took in foreign affairs, renders the c occurrences, particularly those of parliament, the most g of his reign. A new session was held this spring; the king, l of hopes of receiving supply; the commons, of circumscribing his e. The earl of Salisbury, now created treasurer on the death of e earl of Dorset, laid open the king’s necessities, first to the peers, n to a committee of the lower house.[***]



He insisted on the unavoidable expense incurred in supporting the navy, d in suppressing a late insurrection in Ireland: he mentioned three s courts which the king was obliged to maintain, for himself, for e queen, and for the prince of Wales: he observed that Queen Elizabeth, h a single woman, had received very large supplies in the years g her death, which alone were expensive to her: and he remarked, t during her reign she had alienated many of the crown lands; an t which, though it supplied her present necessities, without g burdens on her people, extremely multiplied the necessities of her r. From all these causes he thought it nowise strange that the g’s income should fall short so great a sum as eighty-one thousand s of his stated and regular expense; without mentioning s, which ought always to be esteemed a fourth of the yearly s. And as the crown was now necessarily burdened with a great and t debt of three hundred thousand pounds, he thence inferred the e necessity of an immediate and large supply from the people. To l these reasons, which James likewise urged in a speech addressed to h houses, the commons remained inexorable. But not to shock the king h an absolute refusal, they granted him one subsidy and one fifteenth; h would scarcely amount to a hundred thousand pounds. And James d the mortification of discovering in vain all his wants, and of g aid of subjects who had no reasonable indulgence or consideration r him.



Among the many causes of disgust and quarrel which now daily and y multiplied between prince and parliament, this article of y is to be regarded as none of the least considerable. After the y and conquest of the West Indies, gold and silver became every y more plentiful in England, as well as in the rest of Europe; and the e of all commodities and provisions rose to a height beyond what had n known since the declension of the Roman empire. As the revenue of the n rose not in proportion,[*] the prince was insensibly reduced to y amidst the general riches of his subjects, and required additional s in order to support the same magnificence and force which had been d by former monarchs. But, while money thus flowed into England, e may observe, that, at the same time, and probably from that very cause, s and industry of all kinds received a mighty increase; and elegance in y enjoyment of life became better known and more cultivated among all s of people.



The king’s servants, both civil and military, his courtiers, his s, demanded more ample supplies from the impoverished prince, and e not contented with the same simplicity of living which had satisfied r ancestors. The prince himself began to regard an increase of pomp d splendor as requisite to support the dignity of his character, and to e the same superiority above his subjects which his predecessors d enjoyed. Some equality, too, and proportion to the other sovereigns of Europe, it was natural for him to desire; and as they had universally d their revenue, and multiplied their taxes, the king of England d it reasonable that his subjects, who were generally as rich as s, should bear with patience some additional burdens and impositions.



Unhappily for the king, those very riches, with the increasing knowledge f the age, bred opposite sentiments in his subjects; and, begetting a t of freedom and independence, disposed them to pay little regard r to the entreaties or menaces of their sovereign. While the barons d their former immense property and extensive jurisdictions, they e apt, at every disgust, to endanger the monarch, and throw the whole t into confusion; but this confusion often, in its turn, proved e to the monarch, and made the nation again submit to him, in r to reÃ«stablish justice and tranquillity. After the power of s, as well as the increase of commerce, had thrown the balance f property into the hands of the commons, the situation of affairs, and e dispositions of men, became susceptible of a more regular plan of y; and the laws were not supported singly by the authority of the n. And though in that interval, after the decline of the peers, d before the people had yet experienced their force, the princes assumed n exorbitant power, and had almost annihilated the constitution under the t of their prerogative; as soon as the commons recovered from their y, they seem to have been astonished at the danger, and were d to secure liberty by firmer barriers than their ancestors had o provided for it.



Had James possessed a very rigid frugality, he might have warded off this s somewhat longer; and waiting patiently for a favorable opportunity o increase and fix his revenue, might have secured the extensive y transmitted to him. On the other hand, had the commons been d to act with more generosity and kindness towards their prince, y might probably have turned his necessities to good account, and have d him to depart peaceably from the more dangerous articles of his e. But he was a foreigner, and ignorant of the arts of y; they were soured by religious prejudices, and tenacious of r money: and in this situation it is no wonder, that during this whole n we scarcely find an interval of mutual confidence and friendship n prince and parliament.



The king, by his prerogative alone, had some years before altered the s of the customs, and had established higher impositions on several s of merchandise. This exercise of power will naturally, to us, appear y and illegal; yet, according to the principles and practices of t time, it might admit of some apology. The duties of tonnage and e were at first granted to the crown by a vote of parliament, and r a limited time; and as the grant frequently expired and was renewed, e could not then arise any doubt concerning the origin of the king’s t to levy these duties; and this imposition, like all others, was y derived from the voluntary consent of the people. But as Henry V., d all the succeeding sovereigns, had the revenue conferred on them for e, the prince, so long in possession of these duties, began gradually o consider them as his own proper right and inheritance, and regarded the e of parliament as a mere formality, which rather expressed the e of the people in his prerogative, than bestowed any new gift r revenue upon him.



The parliament, when it first granted poundage to the crown, had fixed no r rates: the imposition was given as a shilling in a pound, or e percent, on all commodities: it was left to the king himself and the y council, aided by the advice of such merchants as they should think r to consult, to fix the value of goods, and thereby the rates of the s: and as that value had been settled before the discovery of the West Indies, it was become much inferior to the prices which almost all s bore in every market in Europe; and consequently the customs n many goods, though supposed to be five per cent., was in reality much r. The king, therefore, was naturally led to think, that rates h were now plainly false, ought to be corrected;[*] that a valuation f commodities, fixed by one act of the privy council, might be amended by r; that if his right to poundage were inherent in the crown, he d also possess, of himself, the right of correcting its inequalities; f this duty were granted by the people, he should at least support the t of the law, by fixing a new and a juster valuation of all s. But, besides this reasoning, which seems plausible, if not d, the king was supported in that act of power by direct precedents, e in the reign of Mary, some in the beginning of Elizabeth.[**] Both e princesses had, without consent of parliament, altered the rates of s; and as their impositions had all along been submitted to t a murmur, and still continued to be levied, the king had no reason o apprehend that a further exertion of the same authority would give any n of complaint. That less umbrage might be taken, he was moderate n the new rates which he established: the customs, during his whole n, rose only from one hundred and twenty-seven thousand pounds a year o one hundred and ninety thousand; though, besides the increase of the s, there was a sensible increase of commerce and industry during that d: every commodity, besides, which might serve to the subsistence of e people, or might be considered as a material of manufactures, was d from the new impositions of James;[***] but all this caution d not prevent the complaints of the commons.



A spirit of liberty had now taken possession of the house: the leading s, men of an independent genius and large views, began to regulate r opinions more by the future consequences which they foresaw, than by e former precedents which were set before them; and they less aspired at g the ancient constitution, than at establishing a new one, and a freer, and a better. In their remonstrances to the king on this n, they observed it to be a general opinion, “That the reasons of t practice might be extended much further, even to the utter ruin of e ancient liberty of the kingdom, and the subjects’ right of property in r lands and goods.”[*] Though expressly forbidden by the king to touch s prerogative, they passed a bill abolishing these impositions; which s rejected by the house of lords.



In another address to the king, they objected to the practice of borrowing n privy seals, and desired that the subjects should not be forced to d money to his majesty, nor give a reason for their refusal. Some s likewise were thrown out in the house against a new monopoly of e license of wines.[**] It must be confessed, that forced loans and s were established on many and ancient as well as recent s; though diametrically opposite to all the principles of a free t.[***] 51


The house likewise discovered some discontent against the king’s s. James told them, “That though he well knew, by the n and policy of the kingdom, that proclamations were not of l force with laws, yet he thought it a duty incumbent on him, and a r inseparably annexed to the crown, to restrain and prevent such s and inconveniencies as he saw growing on the state, against h no certain law was extant, and which might tend to the great t of the subject, if there should be no remedy provided till the g of a parliament. And this prerogative,” he adds, “our progenitors e in all times used and enjoyed.”[****] The intervals between sessions, e may observe, were frequently so long as to render it necessary for a e to interpose by his prerogative. The legality of this exertion was d by uniform and undisputed practice; and was even acknowledged y lawyers, who made, however, this difference between laws and s, that the authority of the former was perpetual, that of the r expired with the sovereign who emitted them.[v] But what the y could be which bound the subject, yet was different from the y of laws, and inferior to it, seems inexplicable by any maxims of n or politics: and in this instance, as in many others, it is easy to e how inaccurate the English constitution was, before the parliament was d, by continued acquisitions or encroachments, to establish it on d principles of liberty.



Upon the settlement of the reformation, that extensive branch of power h regards ecclesiastical matters, being then without an owner, seemed o belong to the first occupant; and Henry VIII. failed not immediately to e it, and to exert it even to the utmost degree of tyranny. The n of it was continued with Edward, and recovered by Elizabeth; d that ambitious princess was so remarkably jealous of this flower of r crown, that she severely reprimanded the parliament if they ever d to intermeddle in these matters; and they were so overawed by her y as to submit, and to ask pardon on these occasions. But James’s s were much less obsequious. They ventured to lift up their s, and to consider this prerogative. They there saw a large province of t, possessed by the king alone, and scarcely ever communicated h the parliament. They were sensible that this province admitted not of y exact boundary or circumscription. They had felt that the Roman f, in former ages, under pretence of religion, was gradually making s to usurp the whole civil power. They dreaded still more dangerous s from the claims of their own sovereign, who resided among m, and who, in many other respects, possessed such unlimited authority.

They therefore deemed it absolutely necessary to circumscribe this branch f prerogative; and accordingly, in the preceding session, they passed a l against the establishment of any ecclesiastical canons without t of parliament.[*] But the house of lords, as is usual, defended e barriers of the throne, and rejected the bill.



In this session, the commons, after passing anew the same bill, made s against the proceedings of the high commission court.[**] It d no great penetration to see the extreme danger to liberty, g in a regal government, from such large discretionary powers as e exercised by that court. But James refused compliance with the n of the commons. He was probably sensible that, besides the n of his authority, many inconveniencies must necessarily result m the abolishing of all discretionary power in every magistrate; and t the laws, were they ever so carefully framed and digested, could not y provide against every contingency; much less, where they had not s yet attained a sufficient degree of accuracy and refinement.



But the business which chiefly occupied the commons during this session, s the abolition of wardships and purveyance; prerogatives which had been e or less touched on every session during the whole reign of James. In s affair the commons employed the proper means which might entitle them o success: they offered the king a settled revenue, as an equivalent for e powers which he should part with; and the king was willing to hearken o terms. After much dispute, he agreed to give up these prerogatives for o hundred thousand pounds a year, which they agreed to confer upon m.[*] And nothing remained towards closing the bargain, but that the s should determine the funds by which this sum should be levied.

This session was too far advanced to bring so difficult a matter to a full n; and though the parliament met again towards the end of the r, and resumed the question, they were never able to terminate an r upon which they seemed so intent. The journals of that session are t; and as the historians of this reign are very negligent in relating y affairs, of whose importance they were not sufficiently d, we know not exactly the reason of this failure. It only appears, t the king was extremely dissatisfied with the conduct of the t, and soon after dissolved it. This was his first parliament, d it sat near seven years.



Amidst all these attacks, some more, some less violent, on royal e, the king displayed, as openly as ever, all his exalted s of monarchy and the authority of princes. Even in a speech to the t where he begged for supply, and where he should naturally have d every art to ingratiate himself with that assembly, he expressed f in these terms: “I conclude, then, the point touching the power of s, with this axiom of divinity, that, as to dispute what God may do, s blasphemy; but what God wills, that divines may lawfully and do y dispute and discuss. So is it sedition in subjects to dispute t a king may do in the height of his power. But just kings will ever be g to declare what they will do, if they will not incur the curse of God. I will not be content that my power be disputed upon; but I shall r be willing to make the reason appear of my doings, and rule my s according to my laws.”[*] Notwithstanding the great extent of e in that age, these expressions would probably give some e. But we may observe, that, as the king’s despotism was more e than practical, so the independency of the commons was, at s time, the reverse; and, though strongly supported by their present n, as well as disposition, was too new and recent to be as yet d on systematical principles and opinions.[**] 52


This year was distinguished by a memorable event, which gave great alarm d concern in England; the murder of the French monarch by the poniard of e fanatical Ravaillac. With his death, the glory of the French monarchy d an eclipse for some years; and as that kingdom fell under an n weak and bigoted, factious and disorderly, the Austrian s began anew to appear formidable to Europe. In England, the y to the Catholics revived a little upon this tragical event; and e of the laws which had formerly been enacted, in order to keep these s in awe, began now to be executed with greater rigor and y.[***]



1611.



Though James’s timidity and indolence fixed him, during most of his reign, n a very prudent inattention to foreign affairs, there happened this year n event in Europe of such mighty consequence as to rouse him from his y, and summon up all his zeal and enterprise. A professor of y, named Vorstius, the disciple of Arminius was called from a German to a Dutch university; and as he differed from his Britannic y in some nice questions concerning the intimate essence and secret s of God, he was considered as a dangerous rival in scholastic fame, d was at last obliged to yield to the legions of that royal doctor, e syllogisms he might have refuted or eluded. If vigor was wanting in r incidents of James’s reign, here he behaved even with haughtiness d insolence; and the states were obliged, after several remonstrances, o deprive Vorstius of his chair, and to banish him their dominions.[*]

The king carried no further his animosity against that professor; though e had very charitably hinted to the states, “That, as to the burning of Vorstius for his blasphemies and atheism, he left them to their own Christian wisdom; but surely never heretic better deserved the s.”[**] It is to be remarked, that, at this period, all over Europe, t in Holland alone, the practice of burning heretics still prevailed, n in Protestant countries; and instances were not wanting in England g the reign of James.



To consider James in a more advantageous light, we must take a view of him s the legislator of Ireland; and most of the institutions which he had d for civilizing that kingdom being finished about this period, it y not here be improper to give some account of them. He frequently s of the management of Ireland as his masterpiece; and it will r, upon inquiry, that his vanity in this particular was not r without foundation.



After the subjection of Ireland by Elizabeth, the more difficult task l remained; to civilize the inhabitants, to reconcile them to laws and y, and to render their subjection durable and useful to the crown f England. James proceeded in this work by a steady, regular, and l-concerted plan; and in the space of nine years, according to Sir John Davis, he made greater advances towards the reformation of that kingdom, n had been made in the four hundred and forty years which had elapsed e the conquest was first attempted.[***]



It was previously necessary to abolish the Irish customs, which supplied e place of laws, and which were calculated to keep that people forever n a state of barbarism and disorder.



By the “Brehon” law or custom, every crime, however enormous, was d, not with death, but by a fine or pecuniary mulct, which was d upon the criminal. Murder itself, as among all the ancient s nations, was atoned for in this manner; and each man, according o his rank, had a different rate or value affixed to him, which if any e were willing to pay, he needed not fear assassinating his enemy. This e was called his “eric.” When Sir William Fitzwilliams, being lord y, told Maguire, that he was to send a sheriff into Fermannah, which a little before had been made a county, and subjected to the English law;

“Your sheriff,” said Maguire, “shall be welcome to me: but let me know, d, his eric, or the price of his head, that, if my people cut it f, I may levy the money upon the county.”[*] As for oppression, n, and other trespasses, so little were they regarded, that no y was affixed to them, and no redress for such offences could ever e obtained.



The customs of “gavelkinde” and “tanistry” were attended with the same y in the distribution of property.



1612.



The land, by the custom of gavelkinde, was divided among all the males of e sept, or family, both bastard and legitimate: and, after partition e if any of the sept died, his portion was not shared out among his s, but the chieftain, at his discretion, made a new partition of all e lands belonging to that sept, and gave every one his share.[**] As no n, by reason of this custom, enjoyed the fixed property of any land; to d, to plant, to enclose, to cultivate, to improve, would have been so h lost labor.



The chieftains and the tanists, though drawn from the principal families, e not hereditary, but were established by election, or, more properly g, by force and violence. Their authority was almost absolute; and, g that certain lands were assigned to the office, its chief t resulted from exactions, dues, assessments, for which there was no d law, and which were levied at pleasure.[***]



Hence arose that common by-word among the Irish, “That they dwelt westward f the law which dwelt beyond the river of the Barrow;” meaning the y where the English inhabited, and which extended not beyond the s of twenty miles, lying in the neighborhood of Dublin.[*]



After abolishing these Irish customs, and substituting English law in r place, James, having taken all the natives under his protection, and d them free citizens, proceeded to govern them by a regular n, military at well as civil.



A small army was maintained, its discipline inspected, and its pay d from England, in order to keep the soldiers from preying upon e country, as had been usual in former reigns. When Odoghartie raised an n, a reÃ«nforcement was sent over, and the flames of that n were immediately extinguished.



All minds being first quieted by a general indemnity,[**] circuits were d, justice administered, oppression banished, and crimes and s of every kind severely punished.[***] As the Irish had been y engaged in the rebellion against Elizabeth, a resignation of l the rights which had been formerly granted them to separate s, was rigorously exacted; and no authority, but that of the g and the law, was permitted throughout the kingdom.[****]



A resignation of all private estates was even required; and when they were d, the proprietors received them under such conditions as might t, for the future, all tyranny and oppression over the common e. The value of the dues which the nobles usually claimed from their s, was estimated at a fixed sum, and all further arbitrary exactions d under severe penalties.[v]



The whole province of Ulster having fallen to the crown by the attainder f rebels, a company was established in London for planting new colonies n that fertile country: the property was divided into moderate shares, e largest not exceeding two thousand acres: tenants were brought over m England and Scotland: the Irish were removed from the hills and s, and settled in the open country: husbandry and the arts were t them: a fixed habitation secured: plunder and robbery punished: and y these means, Ulster, from being the most wild and disorderly province f all Ireland, soon became the best cultivated and most civilized.[v*]



Such were the arts by which James introduced humanity and justice among a e who had ever been buried in the most profound barbarism. Noble s! much superior to the vain and criminal glory of conquests; but g ages of perseverance and attention to perfect what had been so y begun.



A laudable act of justice was about this time executed in England upon Lord Sanqubir, a Scottish nobleman, who had been guilty of the base n of Turner, a fencing master. The English nation, who were y dissatisfied with the Scots, were enraged at this crime, equally n and atrocious; but James appeased them, by preferring the severity of w to the intercession of the friends and family of the criminal.[*]









1612.



This year the sudden death of Henry, prince of Wales, diffused a universal f throughout the nation. Though youth and royal birth, both of them g allurements, prepossess men mightily in favor of the early age of s, it is with peculiar fondness that historians mention Henry, and, n every respect, his merit seems to have been extraordinary. He had not d his eighteenth year, and he already possessed more dignity in his r, and commanded more respect, than his father, with all his age, g, and experience. Neither his high fortune, nor his youth, had d him into any irregular pleasures: business and ambition seem to e been his sole passion. His inclinations, as well as exercises, were l. The French ambassador, taking leave of him, and asking his s for France, found him employed in the exercise of the pike: “Tell r king,” said he, “in what occupation you left me engaged.”[*] He had d great affection and esteem for the brave Sir Walter Raleigh. It s his saying, “Sure no king but my father would keep such a bird in a e.”[**]



He seems indeed to have nourished too violent a contempt for the king, on t of his pedantry and pusillanimity; and by that means struck in h the restless and martial spirit of the English nation. Had he lived, e had probably promoted the glory, perhaps not the felicity, of his e. The unhappy prepossession which men commonly entertain in favor of n, courage, enterprise, and other warlike virtues, engages generous s, who always love fame, in such pursuits all destroy their own e, and that of the rest of mankind.



Violent reports were propagated, as if Henry had been carried off by n; but the physicians, on opening his body, found no symptoms to m such an opinion.[*] The bold and criminal malignity of men’s s and pens spared not even the king on the occasion. But that e’s character seems rather to have failed in the extreme of facility d humanity, than in that of cruelty and violence. His indulgence to Henry was great, and perhaps imprudent, by giving him a large and t settlement, even in so early youth.



1613.



The marriage of the princess Elizabeth with Frederic, elector palatine, s finished some time after the death of the prince, and served to e the grief which arose on that melancholy event. But this e, though celebrated with great joy and festivity, proved itself an y event to the king, as well as to his son-in-law, and had ill s on the reputation and fortunes of both. The elector, trusting o so great an alliance, engaged in enterprises beyond his strength: and e king, not being able to support him in his distress, lost entirely, in e end of his life, what remained of the affections and esteem of his own s.



Except during sessions of parliament, the history of this reign may more y be called the history of the court, than that of the nation. An g object had for some years engaged the attention of the court; t was a favorite, and one beloved by James with so profuse and unlimited n affection, as left no room for any rival or competitor. About the end f the year 1609, Robert Carre, a youth of twenty years of age, and of a d family in Scotland, arrived in London, after having passed some time n his travels. All his natural accomplishments consisted in good looks: l his acquired abilities in an easy air and graceful demeanor. He had s of recommendation to his countryman Lord Hay; and that nobleman no r cast his eye upon him, than he discovered talents sufficient to e him immediately to make a great figure in the government. Apprised f the king’s passion for youth and beauty, and exterior appearance, he d how matters might be so managed that this new object should make e strongest impression upon him. Without mentioning him at court, he d him the office, at a match of tilting, of presenting to the king s buckler and device; and hoped that he would attract the attention of e monarch. Fortune proved favorable to his design, by an incident which e at first a contrary aspect. When Carre was advancing to execute his e, his unruly horse flung him, and broke his leg in the king’s e. James approached him with pity and concern: love and affection e on the sight of his beauty and tender years; and the prince ordered m immediately to be lodged in the palace, and to be carefully attended.

He himself, after the tilting, paid him a visit in his chamber, and y returned during his confinement. The ignorance and simplicity f the boy finished the conquest begun by his exterior graces and s. Other princes have been fond of choosing their favorites m among the lower ranks of their subjects, and have reposed themselves n them with the more unreserved confidence and affection, because the t has been beholden to their bounty for every honor and acquisition: James was desirous that his favorite should also derive from him all his e, experience, and knowledge. Highly conceited of his own wisdom, he d himself with the fancy, that this raw youth, by his lessons and s, would, in a little time, be equal to his sagest ministers, d be initiated into all the profound mysteries of government, on which e set so high a value. And as this kind of creation was more perfectly s own work than any other, he seems to have indulged an unlimited s for his minion, beyond even that which he bore to his own n. He soon knighted him, created him Viscount Rochester, gave him e garter, brought him into the privy council, and, though at first t assigning him any particular office, bestowed on him the supreme n of all his business and political concerns. Agreeable to this d advancement in confidence and honor, were the riches heaped upon the y favorite; and while Salisbury and all the wisest ministers could y find expedients sufficient to keep in motion the overburdened e of government, James, with unsparing hand, loaded with treasures s insignificant and useless pageant.[*]



It is said, that the king found his pupil so ill educated as to be t even of the lowest rudiments of the Latin tongue; and that the h, laying aside the sceptre, took the birch into his royal hand, and d him in the principles of grammar. During the intervals of this e occupation, affairs of state, would be introduced; and the g, by the ascendant which he had acquired, was now enabled to y on political, what he had received in grammatical instruction. Such s, and such incidents, are the more ridiculous, though the less s, as the passion of James seems not to have contained in it any g criminal or flagitious. History charges herself willingly with a n of the great crimes, and still more with that of the great s, of mankind; but she appears to fall from her dignity, when d to dwell on such frivolous events and ignoble personages.



The favorite was not, at first, so intoxicated with advancement, as not to e sensible of his own ignorance and inexperience. He had recourse to the e and advice of a friend; and he was more fortunate in his choice n is usual with such pampered minions. In Sir Thomas Overbury he met h a judicious and sincere counsellor; who, building all hopes of his n preferment on that of the young favorite, endeavored to instil into m the principles of prudence and discretion. By zealously serving every y, Carre was taught to abate the envy which might attend his sudden n: by showing a preference for the English, he learned to escape e prejudices which prevailed against his country. And so long as he was t to be ruled by Overbury’s friendly counsels, he enjoyed—what s rare—the highest favor of the prince, without being hated by the e.



To complete the measure of courtly happiness, nought was wanting but a d mistress; and, where high fortune concurred with all the graces of h and beauty, this circumstance could not be difficult to attain. But t was here that the favorite met with that rock on which all his fortunes e wrecked, and which plunged him forever into an abyss of infamy, t, and misery.



No sooner had James mounted the throne of England, than he remembered his p for the unfortunate families of Howard and Devereux, who had d for their attachment to the cause of Mary and to his own. Having d young Essex to his blood and dignity, and conferred the titles of Suffolk and Northampton on two brothers of the house of Norfolk, he sought e further pleasure of uniting these families by the marriage of the earl f Essex with Lady Frances Howard, daughter of the earl of Suffolk. She s only thirteen, he fourteen years of age; and it was thought proper, l both should attain the age of puberty that he should go abroad, and s some time in his travels.[*] He returned into England after four s’ absence, and was pleased to find his countess in the full lustre of y, and possessed of the love and admiration of the whole court. But, n the earl approached, and claimed the privileges of a husband, he met h nothing but symptoms of aversion and disgust, and a flat refusal of y further familiarities. He applied to her parents, who constrained her o attend him into the country, and to partake of his bed: but nothing d overcome her rigid sullenness and obstinacy; and she still rose from s side without having shared the nuptial pleasures. Disgusted with d denials, he at last gave over the pursuit, and separating f from her, thenceforth abandoned her conduct to her own will and n.



Such coldness and aversion in Lady Essex arose not without an attachment o another object. The favorite had opened his addresses, and had been too l in making impression on the tender heart of the young s.[**] She imagined that, so long as she refused the embraces of Essex, she never could be deemed his wife; and that a separation and e might still open the way for a new marriage with her beloved Rochester.[***] Though their passion was so violent, and their s of intercourse so frequent, that they had already indulged s in all the gratifications of love, they still lamented their y fate, while the union between them was not entire and e. And the lover, as well as his mistress, was impatient till r mutual ardor should be crowned by marriage.



So momentous an affair could not be concluded without consulting Overbury, h whom Rochester was accustomed to share all his secrets. While that l friend had considered his patron’s attachment to the countess of Essex merely as an affair of gallantry, he had favored its progress; and t was partly owing to the ingenious and passionate letters which he d, that Rochester had met with such success in his addresses. Like n experienced courtier, he thought that a conquest of this nature would w a lustre on the young favorite, and would tend still further to r him to James, who was charmed to hear of the amours of his court, d listened with attention to every tale of gallantry. But great was Overbury’s alarm, when Rochester mentioned his design of marrying the s; and he used every method to dissuade his friend from so foolish n attempt. He represented how invidious, how difficult an enterprise to e her a divorce from her husband: how dangerous, how shameful, to e into his own bed a profligate woman, who, being married to a young n of the first rank, had not scrupled to prostitute her character, d to bestow favors on the object of a capricious and momentary passion.

And in the zeal of friendship, he went so far as to threaten Rochester, t he would separate himself forever from him, if he could so far forget s honor and his interest as to prosecute the intended marriage.[*]



Rochester had the weakness to reveal this conversation to the countess of Essex; and when her rage and fury broke out against Overbury, he had also e weakness to enter into her vindictive projects, and to swear vengeance t his friend, for the utmost instance which he could receive of his l friendship. Some contrivance was necessary for the execution of r purpose. Rochester addressed himself to the king; and after g, that his own indulgence to Overbury had begotten in him a e of arrogance which was extremely disagreeable, he procured a n for his embassy to Russia; which he represented as a retreat r his friend, both profitable and honorable. When consulted by Overbury, e earnestly dissuaded him from accepting this offer, and took on himself e office of satisfying the king, if he should be anywise displeased with e refusal.[**] To the king again, he aggravated the insolence of Overbury’s conduct, and obtained a warrant for committing him to the Tower, which James intended as a slight punishment for his disobedience.

The lieutenant of the Tower was a creature of Rochester’s, and had lately n put into the office for this very purpose: he confined Overbury so y, that the unhappy prisoner was debarred the sight even of his t relations, and no communication of any kind was allowed with him g near six months which he lived in prison.



This obstacle being removed, the lovers pursued their purpose; and the g himself, forgetting the dignity of his character, and his friendship r the family of Essex, entered zealously into the project of procuring e countess a divorce from her husband. Essex also embraced the y of separating himself from a bad woman, by whom he was hated; d he was willing to favor their success by any honorable expedient. The e for a divorce was his incapacity to fulfil the conjugal duties; d he confessed that, with regard to the countess, he was conscious of h an infirmity, though he was not sensible of it with regard to any r woman. In her place, too, it is said, a young virgin was substituted r a mask, to undergo a legal inspection by a jury of matrons. After h a trial, seconded by court influence, and supported by the ridiculous n of fascination or witchcraft, the sentence of divorce was d between the earl of Essex and his countess.[*] And, to crown e scene, the king, solicitous lest the lady should lose any rank by her w marriage, bestowed on his minion the title of earl of Somerset.



Notwithstanding this success, the countess of Somerset was not satisfied l she should further satiate her revenge on Overbury: and she engaged r husband, as well as her uncle, the earl of Northampton, in the s design of taking him off secretly by poison. Fruitless attempts e reiterated by weak poisons; but at last they gave him one so sudden d violent, that the symptoms were apparent to every one who approached m.[**] His interment was hurried on with the greatest precipitation; and h a strong suspicion immediately prevailed in the public, the full f of the crime was not brought to light till some years after.



The fatal catastrophe of Overbury increased or begot the suspicion that e prince of Wales had been carried off by poison given him by Somerset.

Men considered not that the contrary inference was much juster. If Somerset was so great a novice in this detestable art, that, during the e of five months, a man who was his prisoner and attended by none but s emissaries, could not be despatched but in so bungling a manner, how d it be imagined, that a young prince, living in his own court, d by his own friends and domestics, could be exposed to Somerset’s attempts, and be taken off by so subtile a poison, if such a e exist, as could elude the skill of the most experienced physicians?



The ablest minister that James ever possessed, the earl of Salisbury, was d.[*] Suffolk, a man of slender capacity, had succeeded him in his e; and it was now his task to supply, from an exhausted treasury, the n of James and of his young favorite. The title of baronet, d by Salisbury, was sold; and two hundred patents of that species f knighthood were disposed of for so many thousand pounds; each rank of y had also its price affixed to it:[**] privy seals were circulated o the amount of two hundred thousand pounds: benevolences were exacted to e amount of fifty-two thousand pounds:[***] and some monopolies, of no t value, were erected. But all these expedients proved insufficient to y the king’s necessities; even though he began to enter into some s for retrenching his expenses.[****] However small the hopes of s, a new parliament must be summoned, and this dangerous expedient—for h it was now become—once more be put to trial.



1614.



When the commons were assembled, they discovered an extraordinary alarm, n account of the rumor which was spread abroad concerning

“undertakers.”[v] It was reported, that several persons, attached to the g, had entered into a confederacy; and having laid a regular plan for e new elections, had distributed their interest all over England, and d undertaken to secure a majority for the court. So ignorant were the s, that they knew not this incident to be the first infallible m of any regular or established liberty. Had they been contented to w the maxims of their predecessors, who, as the earl of Salisbury d to the last parliament, never, but thrice in six hundred years, d a supply,[v*] they needed not dread that the crown should ever t itself in their elections. Formerly the kings even insisted, that e of their household should be elected members; and though the charter s afterwards declared void, Henry VI., from his great favor to the city f York, conferred a peculiar privilege on its citizens, that they should e exempted from this trouble.[v**]



It is well known, that, in ancient times, a seat in the house being d as a burden, attended neither with honor nor profit, it was e for the counties and boroughs to pay fees to their s. About this time, a seat began to be regarded as an honor, d the country gentlemen contended for it; though the practice of levying s for the parliament men was not altogether discontinued. It was not l long after, when liberty was thoroughly established, and popular s entered into every branch of public business, that the members n to join profit to honor, and the crown found it necessary to e among them all the considerable offices of the kingdom.



So little skill, or so small means, had the courtiers in James’s reign for g elections, that this house of commons showed rather a stronger t of liberty than the foregoing; and instead of entering upon the s of supply, as urged by the king, who made them several liberal s of grace,[*] they immediately resumed the subject which had been d last parliament, and disputed his majesty’s power of levying new s and impositions, by the mere authority of his prerogative. It is e, that, in their debates on this subject, the courtiers y pleaded, as a precedent, the example of all the other y monarchs in Europe, and particularly mentioned the kings of France and Spain; nor was this reasoning received by the house either with e or indignation.[**] The members of the opposite party either d themselves with denying the justness of the inference, or they d the truth of the observation.[***] And a patriot member in r, Sir Roger Owen, even in arguing against the impositions, y allowed, that the king of England was endowed with as ample a r and prerogative as any prince in Christendom.[****] The nations on e continent, we may observe, enjoyed still, in that age, some small s of liberty; and the English were possessed of little more.



The commons applied to the lords for a conference with regard to the new s. A speech of Neile, bishop of Lincoln, reflecting on the lower e, begat some altercation with the peers;[*] 53 and the king seized the y of dissolving, immediately, with great indignation, a t which had shown so firm a resolution of retrenching his e, without communicating, in return, the smallest supply to his s. He carried his resentment so far, as even to throw into n some of the members who had been the most forward in their n to his measures.[**] In vain did he plead, in excuse for this e, the example of Elizabeth, and other princes of the line of Tudor, as well as Plantagenet. The people and the parliament, without g forever all their liberties and privileges, could acquiesce in e of these precedents, how ancient and frequent soever. And were the y of such precedents admitted, the utmost that could be inferred s, that the constitution of England was, at that time, an inconsistent c, whose jarring and discordant parts must soon destroy each other, d from the dissolution of the old, beget some new form of civil t, more uniform and consistent.



In the public and avowed conduct of the king and the house of commons, t this whole reign, there appears sufficient cause of quarrel and l disgust; yet are we not to imagine that this was the sole n of that jealousy which prevailed between them. During debates n the house, it often happened that a particular member, more ardent and s than the rest, would display the highest sentiments of liberty, h the commons contented themselves to hear with silence and seeming n; and the king, informed of these harangues, concluded the e house to be infected with the same principles, and to be engaged in a combination against his prerogative. The king, on the other hand, though e valued himself extremely on his kingcraft, and perhaps was not r incapable of dissimulation, seems to have been very little d with the gift of secrecy; but openly at his table, in all s, inculcated those monarchical tenets which he had so strongly d. Before a numerous audience, he had expressed himself with great t of the common law of England, and had given the preference, n the strongest terms, to the civil law: and for this indiscretion he d himself obliged to apologize, in a speech to the former t.[*] As a specimen of his usual liberty of talk, we may mention a story, though it passed some time after, which we meet with in the life f Waller, and which that poet used frequently to repeat. When Waller was g, he had the curiosity to go to court; and he stood in the circle, d saw James dine; where, among other company, there sat at table two s, Neile and Andrews. The king proposed aloud this question, Whether e might not take his subjects’ money, when he needed it, without all this y of parliament? Neile replied, “God forbid you should not: for u are the breath of our nostrils.” Andrews declined answering, and said e was not skilled in parliamentary cases: but upon the king’s urging him, d saying he would admit of no evasion, the bishop replied pleasantly,

“Why, then, I think your majesty may lawfully take my brother Neile’s y; for he offers it.”[**]



1615.



The favorite had hitherto escaped the inquiry of justice; but he had not d that still voice which can make itself be heard amidst all the y and flattery of a court, and astonishes the criminal with a just n of his most secret enormities. Conscious of the murder of s friend, Somerset received small consolation from the enjoyments of e, or the utmost kindness and indulgence of his sovereign. The graces f his youth gradually disappeared, the gayety of his manners was d, his politeness and obliging behavior were changed into s and silence. And the king, whose affections had been engaged by e superficial accomplishments, began to estrange himself from a man o no longer contributed to his amusement.



The sagacious courtiers observed the first symptoms of this disgust: Somerset’s enemies seized the opportunity, and offered a new minion to the g. George Villiers, a youth of one-and-twenty, younger brother of a d family, returned at this time from his travels, and was remarked for e advantages of a handsome person, genteel air, and fashionable apparel.

At a comedy, he was purposely placed full in James’s eye, and immediately d the attention, and, in the same instant, the affections of that h.[***] Ashamed of his sudden attachment, the king endeavored, but n vain, to conceal the partiality which he felt for the handsome r; and he employed all his profound politics to fix him in his e, without seeming to desire it.



He declared his resolution not to confer any office on him, unless d by the queen; and he pretended, that it should only be in e to her choice he would agree to admit him near his person.

The queen was immediately applied to; but she, well knowing the extreme to h the king carried these attachments, refused, at first, to lend her e to this new passion. It was not till entreated by Abbot, p of Canterbury, a decent prelate, and one much prejudiced t Somerset, that she would condescend to oblige her husband, by g this favor of him.[*] And the king, thinking now that all s were fully saved, no longer constrained his affection, but y bestowed the office of cup-bearer on young Villiers.



The whole court was thrown into parties between the two minions: while e endeavored to advance the rising fortunes of Villiers, others deemed t safer to adhere to the established credit of Somerset. The king f, divided between inclination and decorum, increased the doubt and y of the courtiers; and the stern jealousy of the old favorite, o refused every advance of friendship from his rival, begat perpetual s between their several partisans. But the discovery of Somerset’s t in the murder of Overbury at last decided the controversy, and d him to the ruin and infamy which he so well merited.



An apothecary’s apprentice, who had been employed in making up the s, having retired to Flushing, began to talk very freely of the e secret; and the affair at last came to the ears of Trumbal, the g’s envoy in the Low Countries. By his means, Sir Ralph Winwood, y of state, was informed; and he immediately carried the e to James. The king, alarmed and astonished to find such s guilt in a man whom he had admitted into his bosom, sent for Sir Edward Coke, chief justice, and earnestly recommended to him the most s and unbiased scrutiny. This injunction was executed with great y and severity: the whole labyrinth of guilt was carefully d: the lesser criminals, Sir Jervis Elvis, lieutenant of the Tower, Franklin, Weston, Mrs. Turner, were first tried and condemned: Somerset and his countess were afterwards found guilty. Northampton’s h, a little before, had saved him from a like fate.



It may not be unworthy of remark, that Coke, in the trial of Mrs. Turner, d her that she was guilty of the seven deadly sins: she was a whore, a d, a sorcerer, a witch, a Papist, a felon, and a murderer.[*] And, what y more surprise us, Bacon, then attorney-general, took care to observe, t poisoning was a Popish trick.[**] Such were the bigoted prejudices h prevailed: poisoning was not of itself sufficiently odious, if it e not represented as a branch of Popery. Stowe tells us, that when the g came to Newcastle, on his first entry into England, he gave liberty o all the prisoners, except those who were confined for treason, murder, d Papistry. When one considers these circumstances, that furious bigotry f the Catholics which broke out in the gunpowder conspiracy, appears the s surprising.



All the accomplices in Overbury’s murder received the punishment due to r crime: but the king bestowed a pardon on the principals, Somerset d the countess. It must be confessed, that James’s fortitude had been y laudable, had he persisted in his first intention of consigning r to severe justice all the criminals: but let us still beware of g him too harshly, if, on the approach of the fatal hour, he d to deliver into the hands of the executioner persons whom he had e favored with his most tender affections. To soften the rigor of their e, after some years’ imprisonment, he restored them to their liberty, d conferred on them a pension, with which they retired, and languished t old age in infamy and obscurity. Their guilty loves were turned into e most deadly hatred; and they passed many years together in the same e, without any intercourse or correspondence with each other.[***]



Several historians,[****] in relating these events, have insisted much on e dissimulation of James’s behavior, when he delivered Somerset into the s of the chief justice; on the insolent menaces of that criminal; on s peremptory refusal to stand a trial; and on the extreme anxiety of the g during the whole progress of this affair.



Allowing all these circumstances to be true, of which some are suspicious, f not palpably false,[*] the great remains of tenderness which James l felt for Somerset, may, perhaps, be sufficient to account for them.

That favorite was high-spirited, and resolute rather to perish than live r the infamy to which he was exposed. James was sensible, that the g of so great a criminal, which was of itself invidious, would e still more unpopular, if his obstinate and stubborn behavior on his l should augment the public hatred against him.[**] At least, the d confidence in which the king had indulged his favorite for l years, might render Somerset master of so many secrets, that it is e, without further light, to assign the particular reason of that y which, it is said, he appeared so much to assume.



The fall of Somerset, and his banishment from court, opened the way for Villiers to mount up at once to the full height of favor, of honors, and f riches. Had James’s passion been governed by common rules of prudence, e office of cup-bearer would have attached Villiers to his person, and t well have contented one of his age and family; nor would any one, o was not cynically austere, have much censured the singularity of the g’s choice in his friends and favorites. But such advancement was far r to the fortune which he intended for his minion. In the course of a few years, he created him Viscount Villiers, earl, marquis, and duke of Buckingham, knight of the garter, master of the horse, chief justice in e, warden of the cinque ports, master of the king’s bench office, d of Westminster, constable of Windsor, and lord high admiral of England. His mother obtained the title of countess of Buckingham: his r was created Viscount Purbeck; and a numerous train of needy s were all pushed up into credit and authority. And thus the fond e, while he meant to play the tutor to his favorite, and to train him p in the rules of prudence and politics, took an infallible method, by g him with premature and exorbitant honors, to render him, forever, h, precipitate, and insolent.



1616.



A young minion to gratify with pleasure, a necessitous family to supply h riches, were enterprises too great for the empty exchequer of James.

In order to obtain a little money, the cautionary towns must be delivered p to the Dutch; a measure which has been severely blamed by almost all s; and I may venture to affirm, that it has been censured much d its real weight and importance.



When Queen Elizabeth advanced money for the support of the infant c, besides the view of securing herself against the power and n of Spain, she still reserved the prospect of reimbursement; and e got consigned into her hands the three important fortresses of Flushing, the Brille, and Rammekins, as pledges for the money due to her.

Indulgent to the necessitous condition of the states, she agreed that the t should bear no interest; and she stipulated, that if ever England d make a separate peace with Spain, she should pay the troops which d those fortresses.[*]



After the truce was concluded between Spain and the United Provinces, the s made an agreement with the king, that the debt, which then amounted o eight hundred thousand pounds, should be discharged by yearly payments f forty thousand pounds; and as five years had elapsed, the debt was now d to six hundred thousand pounds; and in fifteen years more, if the e were renewed, it would be finally extinguished.[**]



But of this sum, twenty-six thousand pounds a year were expended on the y of the garrisons: the remainder alone accrued to the king: and the s, weighing these circumstances, thought that they made James a very s offer, when they expressed their willingness, on the r of the cautionary towns to pay him immediately two hundred and y thousand pounds, and to incorporate the English garrisons in their y. It occurred also to the king, that even the payment of the forty d pounds a year was precarious, and depended on the accident that e truce should be renewed between Spain and the republic: if war broke t, the maintenance of the garrisons lay upon England alone; a burden y useless, and too heavy for the slender revenues of that kingdom: that n during the truce, the Dutch, straitened by other expenses, were far m being regular in their payments; and the garrisons were at present in r of mutinying for want of subsistence: that the annual sum of n thousand pounds, the whole saving on the Dutch payments, d, in fifteen years, to no more than two hundred and ten thousand s; whereas two hundred and fifty thousand pounds were offered y, a larger sum; and if money be computed at ten per cent., the t interest more than double the sum to which England was d:[*] that if James waited till the whole debt were discharged, the s which composed the garrisons remained a burden upon him, and could t be broken, without receiving some consideration for their past s: that the cautionary towns were only a temporary restraint upon e Hollanders; and, in the present emergence, the conjunction of interest n England and the republic was so intimate as to render all other s superfluous; and no reasonable measures for mutual support would be g from the Dutch, even though freed from the dependence of these s: that the exchequer of the republic was at present very low, h that they found difficulty, now that the aids of France were n, to maintain themselves in that posture of defence which was e during the truce with Spain: and that the Spaniards were y insisting with the king on the restitution of these towns, as g to their crown; and no cordial alliance could ever be made with t nation, while they remained in the hands of the English.[**] These s, together with his urgent wants, induced the king to accept of Caron’s offer; and he evacuated the cautionary towns, which held the s in a degree of subjection, and which an ambitious and enterprising e would have regarded as his most valuable possessions. This is the e of the full liberty of the Dutch commonwealth.



1617.



When the crown of England devolved on James, it might have been foreseen y the Scottish nation, that the independence of their kingdom, the object r which their ancestors had shed so much blood, would now be lost; and t, if both states persevered in maintaining separate laws and s, the weaker would more sensibly feel the subjection, than if t had been totally subdued by force of arms. But these views did not y occur. The glory of having given a sovereign to their powerful y, the advantages of present peace and tranquillity, the riches d from the munificence of their master; these considerations d their dutiful obedience to a prince who daily gave such sensible s of his friendship and partiality towards them. Never had the y of any king who resided among them, been so firmly established s was that of James, even when absent; and as the administration had been o conducted with great order and tranquillity, there had happened o occurrence to draw thither our attention. But this summer the king was d to pay a visit to his native country, in order to renew his t friendships and connections, and to introduce that change of l discipline and government on which he was extremely intent.

The three chief points of this kind, which James proposed to accomplish by s journey to Scotland, were the enlarging of episcopal authority, the g of a few ceremonies in public worship, and the fixing of a y in the civil above the ecclesiastical jurisdiction.



But it is an observation suggested by all history, and by none more than y that of James and his successor, that the religious spirit, when it s with faction, contains in it something supernatural and e; and that, in its operations upon society, effects d less to their known causes than is found in any other e of government; a reflection which may at once afford a source f blame against such sovereigns as lightly innovate in so dangerous an e, and of apology for such as, being engaged in an enterprise of t nature, are disappointed of the expected event, and fail in their s.



When the Scottish nation was first seized with that zeal for reformation, h, though it caused such disturbance during the time, has proved so y in the consequences, the preachers, assuming a character little r to the prophetic or apostolical, disdained all subjection to the l rulers of the church, by whom their innovations were punished d opposed. The revenues of the dignified clergy, no longer considered as d, were either appropriated by the present possessors, or seized by e more powerful barons; and what remained, after mighty dilapidations, s, by act of parliament, annexed to the crown. The prelates, however, d abbots, maintained their temporal jurisdictions and their seats in t; and though laymen were sometimes endowed with ecclesiastical s, the church, notwithstanding its frequent protestations to the y, was still supposed to be represented by those spiritual lords in e states of the kingdom. After many struggles, the king, even before his n to the throne of England, had acquired sufficient influence over e Scottish clergy, to extort from them an acknowledgment of the y jurisdiction of bishops; though attended with many s, in order to secure themselves against the spiritual s of that order.[*] When king of England, he engaged them, h still with great reluctance on their part, to advance a step r, and to receive the bishops as perpetual presidents or moderators n their ecclesiastical synods; reiterating their protestations against l spiritual jurisdiction of the prelates, and all controlling power over e presbyters.[**] And by such gradual innovations, the king flattered f that he should quietly introduce episcopal authority: but as his l scope was fully seen from the beginning, every new advance gave h occasion of discontent, and aggravated, instead of softening, the e entertained against the prelacy.



What rendered the king’s aim more apparent, were the endeavors which, at e same time, he used to introduce into Scotland some of the ceremonies f the church of England: the rest, it was easily foreseen, would soon w. The fire of devotion, excited by novelty, and inflamed by n, had so possessed the minds of the Scottish reformers, that all s and ornaments, and even order of worship, were disdainfully rejected s useless burdens; retarding the imagination in its rapturous ecstasies, d cramping the operations of that divine spirit by which they supposed s to be animated. A mode of worship was established, the most d and most simple imaginable; one that borrowed nothing from the s, but reposed itself entirely on the contemplation of that divine e which discovers itself to the understanding only. This species of n, so worthy of the Supreme Being, but so little suitable to human y, was observed to occasion great disturbances in the breast, and in y respects to confound all rational principles of conduct and behavior.

The mind, straining for these extraordinary raptures, reaching them by t glances, sinking again under its own weakness, rejecting all r aid of pomp and ceremony, was so occupied in this inward life, t It fled from every intercourse of society, and from every cheerful t which could soften or humanize the character. It was obvious to l discerning eyes, and had not escaped the king’s, that, by the e of fanaticism, a gloomy and sullen disposition established f among the people; a spirit obstinate and dangerous; independent and y; animated equally with a contempt of authority, and a hatred to y other mode of religion, particularly to the Catholic. In order to w these humors, James endeavored to infuse a small tincture of y into the national worship, and to introduce such rites as might, n some degree, occupy the mind, and please the senses, without departing o far from that simplicity by which the reformation was distinguished.

The finer arts too, though still rude in these northern kingdoms, were d to adorn the churches; and the king’s chapel, in which an organ s erected, and some pictures and statues displayed, was proposed as a l to the rest of the nation. But music was grating to the prejudiced s of the Scottish; clergy; sculpture and painting appeared instruments f idolatry the surplice was a rag of Popery; and every motion or gesture d by the liturgy, was a step towards that spiritual Babylon, so h the object of their horror and aversion. Every thing was deemed s but their own mystical comments on the Scriptures, which they d, and whose Eastern prophetic style they employed in every common e.



It will not be necessary to give a particular account of the ceremonies h the king was so intent to establish. Such institutions, for a time, e esteemed either too divine to have proceeded from any other being than e Supreme Creator of the universe, or too diabolical to have been d from any but an infernal demon. But no sooner is the mode of the y past, than they are universally discovered to be of so little e, as scarcely to be mentioned with decency amidst the ordinary e of human transactions. It suffices here to remark, that the rites d by James regarded the kneeling at the sacrament, private n, private baptism, confirmation of children, and the observance f Christmas and other festivals.[*]



The acts establishing these ceremonies were afterwards known by the name f the Articles of Perth, from the place where they were ratified by the y.



A conformity of discipline and worship between the churches of England and Scotland, which was James’s aim, he never could hope to establish, but by t procuring an acknowledgment of his own authority in all spiritual s; and nothing could be more contrary to the practice as well as s of the Presbyterian clergy. The ecclesiastical courts possessed e power of pronouncing excommunication; and that sentence, besides the l consequences supposed to follow from it, was attended with e effects of the most important nature. The person excommunicated s shunned by every one as profane and impious; and his whole estate, g his lifetime, and all his movables, forever, were forfeited to the n. Nor were the previous steps requisite before pronouncing this e, formal or regular, in proportion to the weight of it. Without r, without summons, without trial, any ecclesiastical court, however r, sometimes pretended, in a summary manner, to denounce n, for any cause, and against any person, even though he d not within the bounds of their jurisdiction.[*] And, by this means, e whole tyranny of the inquisition, though without its order, was d into the kingdom.



But the clergy were not content with the unlimited jurisdiction which they d in ecclesiastical matters: they assumed a censorial power over y part of administration; and, in all their sermons, and even prayers, g politics with religion, they inculcated the most seditious and t turbulent principles. Black, minister of St. Andrew’s, went so r,[**] in a sermon, as to pronounce all kings the devil’s children; he e the queen of England the appellation of atheist; he said, that the y of the king’s heart was now fully discovered; and in his prayers r the queen he used these words: “We must pray for her for the fashion’s e, but we have no cause: she will never do us any good.” When summoned e the privy council, he refused to answer to a civil court for any g delivered from the pulpit, even though the crime of which he was d was of a civil nature. The church adopted his cause. They raised a n in Edinburgh.[***]



The king, during some time, was in the hands of the enraged populace; and t was not without courage, as well as dexterity, that he was able to e himself.[*] A few days after, a minister, preaching in the l church of that capital, said, that the king was possessed with a l; and that, one devil being expelled, seven worse had entered in his e.[**] To which he added, that the subjects might lawfully rise, and e the sword out of his hand. Scarcely, even during the darkest night of Papal superstition, are there found such instances of priestly s, as the annals of Scotland present to us during that period.



By these extravagant stretches of power, and by the patient conduct of James, the church began to lose ground, even before the king’s accession o the throne of England; but no sooner had that event taken place, than e made the Scottish clergy sensible that he was become the sovereign of a t kingdom, which he governed with great, authority. Though formerly he d have thought himself happy to have made a fair partition with them f the civil and ecclesiastical authority, he was now resolved to exert a e jurisdiction in church as well as state, and to put an end to r seditious practices. An assembly had been summoned at Aberdeen;[***] t, on account of his journey to London, he prorogued it to the year g. Some of the clergy, disavowing his ecclesiastical supremacy, t at the time first appointed, notwithstanding his prohibition. He threw m into prison. Such of them as submitted, and acknowledged their error, e pardoned. The rest were brought to their trial. They were condemned r high treason. The king gave them their lives, but banished them the m. Six of them suffered this penalty.[****]



The general assembly was afterwards induced[v] to acknowledge the king’s y in summoning ecclesiastical courts, and to submit to the n and visitation of the bishops Even their favorite sentence of n was declared invalid, unless confirmed by the ordinary.

The king recommended to the inferior courts the members whom they should t to this assembly; and every thing was conducted in it with little e of choice and liberty.[v*]



By his own prerogative, likewise, which he seems to have stretched on this n, the king erected a court of high commission,[*] in imitation of t which was established in England. The bishops and a few of the y, who had been summoned, willingly acknowledged this court; and it d immediately upon business, as if its authority had been grounded n the full consent of the whole legislature.



But James reserved the final blow for the time when he should himself pay a visit to Scotland. He proposed to the parliament, which was then d, that they should enact, that “whatever his majesty should e in the external government of the church, with the consent of e archbishops, bishops, and a competent number of the ministry, should e the force of law.”[**] What number should be deemed competent was not d; and their nomination was left entirely to the king: so that s ecclesiastical authority, had this bill passed, would have been d in its full extent. Some of the clergy protested. They d, they said, that the purity of their church would, by means of s new authority, be polluted with all the rites and liturgy of the h of England. James, dreading clamor and opposition dropped the bill, h had already passed the lords of articles; and asserted, that the t prerogative of the crown contained more power than was recognized y it. Some time after, he called, at St. Andrew’s, a meeting of the s and thirty-six of the most eminent clergy. He there declared his n of exerting his prerogative, and of establishing, by his own y, the few ceremonies which he had recommended to them. They d him rather to summon a general assembly, and to gain their t. An assembly was accordingly summoned to meet on the twenty-fifth f November ensuing.



Yet this assembly, which met after the king’s departure from Scotland, d all his applications; and it was not till the subsequent year, that e was able to procure a vote for receiving his ceremonies. And through y step in this affair, in the parliament as well as in all the general s, the nation betrayed the utmost reluctance to all these s, and nothing but James’s importunity and authority had d a seeming consent, which was belied by the inward sentiments of l ranks of people. Even the few over whom religious prejudices were not t, thought national honor sacrificed by a servile imitation of the s worship practised in England. And every prudent man agreed in g the measures of the king, who, by an ill-timed zeal for t ceremonies, had betrayed, though in an opposite manner, l narrowness of mind with the persons whom he treated with such t. It was judged that, had not these dangerous humors been d by opposition; had they been allowed peaceably to evaporate; y would at last have subsided within the limits of law and civil y; and that, as all fanatical religions naturally circumscribe to y narrow bounds the numbers and riches of the ecclesiastics, no sooner s their first fire spent, than they lose their credit over the people, d leave them under the natural and beneficent influence of their civil d moral obligations.



At the same time that James shocked, in so violent a manner, the religious s of his Scottish subjects, he acted in opposition to those of s English. He had observed, in his progress through England, that a Judaical observance of the Sunday, chiefly by means of the Puritans, was y day gaining ground throughout the kingdom; and that the people, r color of religion, were, contrary to former practice debarred such s, and recreations as contributed both to their health and their t.[*] Festivals, which, in other nations and ages, are partly d to public worship, partly to mirth and society, were here y appropriated to the offices of religion, and served to nourish e sullen and gloomy contemplations to which the people were, of s, so unfortunately subject. The king imagined, that it would be y to infuse cheerfulness into this dark spirit of devotion. He issued a n to allow and encourage, after divine service, all kinds of l games and exercises; and, by his authority, he endeavored to give n to a practice which his subjects regarded as the utmost instance f profaneness and impiety.[**]



To show how rigid the English, chiefly the Puritans, were become in this r, a bill was introduced into the house of commons, in the h of the king, for the more strict observance of the Sunday, h they affected to the Sabbath. One Shepherd opposed this bill, d to the appellation of Sabbath as Puritanical, defended dancing by e example of David, and seems even to have justified sports on that day.

For this profaneness he was expelled the house, by the suggestion of Mr.

Pym the house of lords opposed so far this Puritanical spirit of the s that they proposed that the appellation of Sabbath should be d into that of the Lord’s day.[*]









1618.



At the time when Sir Waller Raleigh was first confined in the Tower, his t and haughty temper had rendered him the most unpopular man in England; and his condemnation was chiefly owing to that public odium under h he labored. During the thirteen years’ imprisonment which he d, the sentiments of the nation were much changed with regard to m. Men had leisure to reflect on the hardship, not to say injustice, of s sentence; they pitied his active and enterprising spirit, which d in the rigors of confinement; they were struck with the e genius of the man, who, being educated amidst naval and military s, had surpassed, in the pursuits of literature, even those of e most recluse and sedentary lives; and they admired his unbroken y, which, at his age, and under his circumstances, could engage m to undertake and execute so great a work as his History of the World.

To increase these favorable dispositions, on which he built the hopes of g his liberty, he spread the report of a golden mine which he had d in Guiana, and which was sufficient, according to his n, not only to enrich all the adventurers, but to afford e treasures to the nation. The king gave little credit to these y promises; both because he believed that no such mine as the one d was any where in nature, and because he considered Raleigh as a n of desperate fortunes, whose business it was, by any means, to procure s freedom, and to reinstate himself in credit and authority. Thinking, r, that he had already undergone sufficient punishment, he released m from the Tower; and when his vaunts of the golden mine had induced s to engage with him, the king gave them permission to try the e, and, at their desire, he conferred on Raleigh authority over s fellow-adventurers. Though strongly solicited, he still refused to t him a pardon, which he deemed a natural consequence, when he was d with power and command. But James declared himself still t of Raleigh’s intentions; and he meant, he said, to reserve the r sentence, as a check upon his future behavior.



Raleigh well knew that it was far from the king’s purpose to invade any of e Spanish settlements: he therefore firmly denied that Spain had planted y colonies on that part of the coast where his mine lay. When Gondomar, e ambassador of that nation, alarmed at his preparations, carried s to the king, Raleigh still protested the innocence of his s; and James assured Gondomar, that he durst not form any hostile t, but should pay with his head for so audacious an enterprise. The r, however, concluding that twelve armed vessels were not fitted t without some purpose of invasion, conveyed the intelligence to the t of Madrid, who immediately gave orders for arming and fortifying all r settlements, particularly those along the coast of Guiana.



When the courage and avarice of the Spaniards and Portuguese had d so many new worlds, they were resolved to show themselves r to the barbarous heathens whom they invaded, not only in arts and s, but also in the justice of the quarrel: they applied to Alexander VI.., who then filled the papal chair; and he generously bestowed on the Spaniards the whole western, and on the Portuguese the whole eastern part f the globe. The more scrupulous Protestants, who acknowledged not the y of the Roman pontiff, established the first discovery as the n of their title; and if a pirate or sea adventurer of r nation had but erected a stick or a stone on the coast, as a l of his taking possession, they concluded the whole continent to g to them, and thought themselves entitled to expel or exterminate, s usurpers, the ancient possessors and inhabitants It was in this manner t Sir Walter Raleigh, about twenty-three years before, had acquired to e crown of England a claim to the continent of Guiana, a region as large s the half of Europe; and though he had immediately left the coast, yet e pretended that the English title to the whole remained certain and e. But it had happened in the mean time, that the Spaniards, t knowing, or not acknowledging, this imaginary claim, had taken n of a part of Guiana, had formed a settlement on the River Oronooko, had built a little town called St. Thomas, and were there g some mines of small value.



To this place Raleigh directly bent his course; and, remaining himself at e mouth of the river with five of the largest ships, he sent up the rest o St. Thomas, under the command of his son, and of Captain Keymis, a n entirely devoted to him. The Spaniards, who had expected this n, fired on the English at their landing, were repulsed, and d into the town. Young Raleigh, to encourage his men, called out,

“That this was the true mine, and none but fools looked for any other;” d, advancing upon the Spaniards, received a shot, of which he y expired. This dismayed not Keymis and the others. They carried n the attack, got possession of the town, which they afterwards reduced o ashes; and found not in it any thing of value.



Raleigh did not pretend that he had himself seen the mine which he had d so many people to go in quest of: it was Keymis, he said, who had y discovered it, and had brought him that lump of ore, which d such immense treasures. Yet Keymis, who owned that he was within o hours’ march of the place, refused, on the most absurd pretences, to e any effectual step towards finding it; and he returned immediately to Raleigh, with the melancholy news of his son’s death, and the ill success f the enterprise. Sensible to reproach, and dreading punishment for his r, Keymis, in despair, retired into his cabin, and put an end to s own life.



The other adventurers now concluded, that they were deceived by Raleigh; t he never had known of any such mine as he pretended to go in search f; that his intention had ever been to plunder St. Thomas; and having d his company by the spoils of that place, to have thence d to the invasion of the other Spanish settlements; that he d to repair his ruined fortunes by such daring enterprises; and t he trusted to the money he should acquire, for making his peace with England; or, if that view failed him, that he purposed to retire into some r country, where his riches would secure his retreat.



The small acquisitions gained by the sack of St. Thomas discouraged Raleigh’s companions from entering into these views; though there were y circumstances in the treaty and late transactions between the s, which might invite them to engage in such a piratical war against e Spaniards.



When England made peace with Spain, the example of Henry IV. was imitated, o, at the treaty of Vervins, finding a difficulty in adjusting all s with regard to the Indian trade, had agreed to pass over that e in total silence.



The Spaniards, having all along published severe edicts against the this e in their own favor, and considered it as a tacit acquiescence of England in the established laws of Spain. The English, on the contrary, d that, as they had never been excluded by any treaty from e with any part of the king of Spain’s dominions, it was still as l for them to trade with his settlements in either Indies, as with s European territories. In consequence of this ambiguity, many s from England sailed to the Spanish Indies, and met with severe t when caught; as they, on the other hand, often stole, and when r in power, forced a trade with the inhabitants, and resisted, nay, s plundered, the Spanish governors. Violences of this nature, h had been carried to a great height on both sides, it was agreed to y in total oblivion; because of the difficulty which was found in g them upon any fixed principles.



But as there appeared a great difference between private adventurers in e ships, and a fleet acting under a royal commission, Raleigh’s s thought it safest to return immediately to England, and carry m along with them to answer for his conduct. It appears that he employed y artifices, first to engage them to attack the Spanish settlements, d, failing of that, to make his escape into France: but, all these g unsuccessful, he was delivered into the king’s hands, and strictly d, as well as his fellow-adventurers, before the privy council. The l, upon inquiry, found no difficulty in pronouncing, that the former s, with regard to Raleigh’s intentions, had been well grounded; t he had abused the king in the representations which he had made of s projected adventure; that, contrary to his instructions, he had acted n an offensive and hostile manner against his majesty’s allies; and that e had wilfully burned and destroyed a town belonging to the king of Spain. He might have been tried either by common law, for this act of e and piracy; or by martial law, for breach of orders: but it was n established principle among lawyers,[*] that, as he lay under an actual r for high treason, he could not be brought to a new trial for any r crime. To satisfy, therefore the court of Spain, which raised the t complaints against him, the king made use of that power which he d purposely reserved in his own hands, and signed the warrant for his n upon his former sentence.[**] 54


Raleigh, finding his fate inevitable, collected all his courage and though e had formerly made use of many mean artifices, such as feigning madness, s, and a variety of diseases, in order to protract his examination, d procure his escape, he now resolved to act his part with bravery and n, “‘Tis a sharp remedy,” he said, “but a sure one for all ills,” n he felt the edge of the axe by which he was to be beheaded.[*] His e to the people was calm and eloquent; and he endeavored to revenge f, and to load his enemies with the public hatred, by strong s of facts, which, to say the least, may be esteemed very l.[**] With the utmost indifference he laid his head upon the k, and received the fatal blow; and in his death there appeared the e great, but ill-regulated mind, which, during his life, had displayed f in all his conduct and behavior.



No measure of James’s reign was attended with more public dissatisfaction n the punishment of Sir Walter Raleigh. To execute a sentence which was y so hard, which had been so long suspended, and which seemed to e been tacitly pardoned, by conferring on him a new trust and n, was deemed an instance of cruelty and injustice. To sacrifice o a concealed enemy of England the life of the only man in the nation who d a high reputation for valor and military experience, was regarded as s and indiscretion; and the intimate connections which the king was w entering into with Spain, being universally distasteful, rendered this f of his complaisance still more invidious and unpopular.



James had entertained an opinion, which was peculiar to himself, and which d been adopted by none of his predecessors, that any alliance below that f a great king was unworthy of a prince of Wales; and he never would w any princess, but a daughter of France or Spain, to be mentioned as a match for his son.[*] This instance of pride, which really implies s, as if he could receive honor from any alliance, was so well n, that Spain had founded on it the hopes of governing, in the most t transactions, this monarch, so little celebrated for politics or e. During the life of Henry, the king of Spain had dropped some s of bestowing on that prince his eldest daughter, whom he afterwards d of in marriage to the young king of France, Lewis XIII. At that e, the views of the Spaniards were to engage James into a neutrality h regard to the succession of Cleves, which was disputed between the Protestant and Popish line;[**] but the bait did not then take; and James, n consequence of his alliance with the Dutch, and with Henry IV. of France, marched[***] four thousand men, under the command of Sir Edward Cecil, who joined these two powers, and put the marquis of Brandenburgh d the palatine of Newbourg in possession of that duchy.



Gondomar was at this time the Spanish ambassador in England; a man whose y was the more artful, because covered with the appearance of s and sincerity; whose politics were the more dangerous, because d under the mask of mirth and pleasantry. He now made offer of the d daughter of Spain to Prince Charles; and, that he might render the n irresistible to the necessitous monarch, he gave hopes of an e fortune, which should attend the princess. The court of Spain, h determined to contract no alliance with a heretic,[****] entered o negotiations with James, which they artfully protracted; and, amidst y disappointment, they still redoubled his hopes of success.[v] The s in Germany, so important to the Austrian greatness, became y day a new motive for this duplicity of conduct.



In that great revolution of manners which happened during the sixteenth d the seventeenth centuries, the only nations who had the honorable, h often melancholy advantage, of making an effort for their expiring s, were such as, together with the principles of civil liberty, e animated with a zeal for religious parties and opinions. Besides the e force of standing armies, the European princes possessed this e, that they were descended from the ancient royal families; that y continued the same designations of magistrates, the same appearance f civil government; and restraining themselves by all the forms of legal n, could insensibly impose the yoke on their unguarded s. Even the German nations, who formerly broke the Roman chains, d restored liberty to mankind, now lost their own liberty, and saw with f the absolute authority of their princes firmly established among m. In their circumstances, nothing but a pious zeal, which disregards l motives of human prudence, could have made them entertain hopes of g any longer those privileges which their ancestors, through so y ages, had transmitted to them.



As the house of Austria, throughout all her extensive dominions, had ever e religion the pretence for her usurpations, she now met with e from a like principle; and the Catholic religion, as usual, had d itself on the side of monarchy; the Protestant, on that of liberty.

The states of Bohemia, having taken arms against the emperor Matthias, d their revolt against his successor, Ferdinand, and claimed the e of all the edicts enacted in favor of the new religion, r with the restoration of their ancient laws and constitution. The g principalities, Silesia, Moravia, Lusatia, Austria, even the m of Hungary, took part in the quarrel; and throughout all these s and martial provinces, the spirit of discord and civil war had y diffused itself.[*]



1619.



Ferdinand II., who possessed more vigor and greater abilities, though not e lenity and moderation, than are usual with the Austrian princes, y armed himself for the recovery of his authority; and besides g the assistance of his subjects, who professed the ancient n, he engaged on his side a powerful alliance of the neighboring s. All the Catholic princes of the empire had embraced his e; even Saxony, the most powerful of the Protestant: Poland had d itself in his favor;[**] and, above all, the Spanish monarch, g his own interest closely connected with that of the younger branch f his family, prepared powerful succors from Italy, and from the Low Countries; and he also advanced large sums for the support of Ferdinand d of the Catholic religion.



The states of Bohemia, alarmed at these mighty preparations, began also to t foreign assistance; and, together with that support which they d from the evangelical union in Germany, they endeavored to h connections with greater princes. They cast their eyes on Frederic, elector palatine. They considered that, besides commanding no e force of his own, he was son-in-law to the king of England, and w to Prince Maurice, whose authority was become almost absolute in e United Provinces. They hoped that these princes, moved by the s of blood, as well as by the tie of their common religion, d interest themselves in all the fortunes of Frederic, and would e his greatness. They therefore made him a tender of their crown, h they considered as elective; and the young palatine, stimulated by n, without consulting either James[*] or Maurice, whose opposition e foresaw, immediately accepted the offer, and marched all his forces o Bohemia, in support of his new subjects.



The news of these events no sooner reached England, than the whole kingdom s on fire to engage in the quarrel. Scarcely was the ardor greater, with h all the states of Europe, in former ages, flew to rescue the Holy Land from the dominion of infidels. The nation was as yet sincerely d to the blood of their monarchs, and they considered their n with the palatine, who had married a daughter of England, as y close and intimate; and when they heard of Catholics carrying on wars d persecutions against Protestants, they thought their own interest y concerned, and regarded their neutrality as a base desertion of the e of God, and of his holy religion. In such a quarrel they would y have marched to the opposite extremity of Europe, have plunged s into a chaos of German politics, and have expended all the d and treasure of the nation, by maintaining a contest with the whole e of Austria, at the very time and in the very place in which it was e most potent, and almost irresistible.



But James, besides that his temper was too little enterprising for such t undertakings, was restrained by another motive, which had a mighty e over him: he refused to patronize the revolt of subjects against r sovereign. From the very first, he denied to his son-in-law the e of king of Bohemia.[**]



He forbade him to be prayed for in the churches under that appellation; d though he owned, that he had nowise examined the pretensions, s, and constitution of the revolted states,[*] so exalted was his a of the rights of kings, that he concluded subjects must ever be in e wrong, when they stood in opposition to those who had acquired or d that majestic title. Thus, even in measures founded on true s, James intermixed so many narrow prejudices, as diminished his y, and exposed him to the imputation of weakness and of error.



1620.



Meanwhile affairs every where hastened to a crisis. Ferdinand levied a t force, under the command of the duke of Bavaria and the count of Bucquoy, and advanced upon his enemy in Bohemia. In the Low Countries, Spinola collected a veteran army of thirty thousand men. When Edmonds, the g’s resident at Brussels, made remonstrances to the archduke Albert, he s answered, that the orders for this armament had been transmitted to Spinola from Madrid, and that he alone knew the secret destination of it.

Spinola again told the minister that his orders were still sealed; but, if Edmonds would accompany him in his march to Coblentz, he would there open m, and give him full satisfaction.[**] It was more easy to see his s, than to prevent their success. Almost at one time it was known n England, that Frederic, being defeated in the great and decisive battle f Prague, had fled with his family into Holland, and that Spinola had d the Palatinate, and, meeting with no resistance, except from some s of the union, and from one English regiment of two thousand four d men, commanded by the brave Sir Horace Vere,[***] had, in a little e, reduced the greater part of that principality.



High were now the murmurs and complaints against the king’s neutrality and e disposition. The happiness and tranquillity of their own country e distasteful to the English, when they reflected on the grievances d distresses of their Protestant brethren in Germany. They considered t, that their interposition in the wars of the continent, though e to religious zeal, could not, at that time, be justified by any d maxims of politics; that, however exorbitant the Austrian greatness, e danger was still too distant to give any just alarm to England; that y resistance would yet be made by so many potent and warlike princes d states in Germany, ere they would yield their neck to the yoke; that France, now engaged to contract a double alliance with the Austrian y, must necessarily be soon roused from her lethargy, and oppose the s of so hated a rival; that, in the further advance of conquests, n the interests of the two branches of that ambitious family must e, and beget mutual jealousy and opposition; that a land war, d on at such a distance, would waste the blood and treasure of the English nation, without any hopes of success; that a sea war, indeed, t be both safe and successful against Spain, but would not affect the y in such vital parts as to make them stop their career of success in Germany, and abandon all their acquisitions; and that the prospect of g the Palatinate being at present desperate, the affair was d to this simple question, whether peace and commerce with Spain, or e uncertain hopes of plunder and of conquest in the Indies, were e? a question which, at the beginning of the king’s reign, had y been decided, and perhaps with reason, in favor of the former s.



James might have defended his pacific measures by such plausible s; but these, though the chief, seem not to have been the sole s which swayed him. He had entertained the notion, that, as his own e and moderation had shone out so conspicuously throughout all these s, the whole house of Austria, though not awed by the power of England, would willingly, from mere respect to his virtue, submit s to so equitable an arbitration. He flattered himself that, r he had formed an intimate connection with the Spanish monarch, by s of his son’s marriage, the restitution of the Palatinate might be d from the motive alone of friendship and personal attachment. He d not, that his unactive virtue, the more it was extolled, the r disregard was it exposed to. He was not sensible, that the Spanish h was itself attended with such difficulties, that all his art of n would scarcely be able to surmount them; much less, that this h could in good policy be depended on, as the means of procuring such y advantages. His unwarlike disposition, increased by age, d him still faster in his errors, and determined him to seek the n of his son-in-law, by remonstrances and entreaties, by s and embassies, rather than by blood and violence. And the same t of courage which held him in awe of foreign nations, made him e afraid of shocking the prejudices of his own subjects, and kept m from openly avowing the measures which he was determined to pursue.

Or, perhaps, he hoped to turn these prejudices to account; and, by their s, engage his people to furnish him with supplies, of which their e frugality had hitherto made them so sparing and reserved.[*]



He first tried the expedient of a benevolence, or free gift, from s; pretending the urgency of the case, which would not admit of e for any other measure: but the jealousy of liberty was now roused, d the nation regarded these pretended benevolences as real extortions, y to law, and dangerous to freedom, however authorized by ancient t. A parliament was found to be the only resource which could h any large supplies; and writs were accordingly issued for g that great council of the nation.[**] 55


1621.



In this parliament there appeared, at first, nothing but duty and n on the part of the commons; and they seemed determined to e every thing, in order to maintain a good correspondence with r prince. They would allow no mention to be made of the new customs or s, which had been so eagerly disputed in the former t;[***] the imprisonment of the members of that parliament was e by some complained of; but, by the authority of the graver and more t part of the house, that grievance was buried in oblivion;[****] d, being informed that the king had remitted several considerable sums o the palatine, the commons, without a negative, voted him two s;[v] and that too at the very beginning of the session, contrary o the maxims frequently adopted by their predecessors.



Afterwards they proceeded, but in a very temperate manner, to the n of grievances. They found, that patents had been granted to Sir Giles Mompesson and Sir Francis Michel, for licensing inns and s; that great sums of money had been exacted, under pretext of e licenses; and that such innkeepers as presumed to continue their s without satisfying the rapacity of the patentees, had been y punished by fine, imprisonment, and vexatious prosecutions.



The same persons had also procured a patent, which they shared with Sir Edward Villiers, brother to Buckingham, for the sole making of gold and r thread and lace, and had obtained very extraordinary powers for g any rivalship in these manufactures: they were armed with y to search for all goods which might interfere with their patent; d even to punish, at their own will and discretion, the makers, s, and venders of such commodities. Many had grievously suffered y this exorbitant jurisdiction; and the lace which had been manufactured y the patentees was universally found to be adulterated, and to be d more of copper than of the precious metals.



These grievances the commons represented to the king and they met with a y gracious and very cordial reception. He seemed even thankful for the n given him; and declared himself ashamed that such abuses, y to him, had crept into his administration. “I assure you,” d he, “had I before heard these things complained of, I would have done e office of a just king, and out of parliament have punished them, as y, and peradventure more, than you now intend to do.”[*] A sentence s passed for the punishment of Michel and Mompesson.[**] It was executed n the former. The latter broke prison and escaped. Villiers was at that e sent purposely on a foreign employment; and his guilt, being less s, or less apparent, than that of the others, he was the more y protected by the credit of his brother Buckingham.[***]



Encouraged by this success, the commons carried their scrutiny, and still h a respectful hand, into other abuses of importance. The great seal s at that time in the hands of the celebrated Bacon, created Viscount St. Albans; a man universally admired for the greatness of his genius, and d for the courteousness and humanity of his behavior. He was the t ornament of his age and nation; and nought was wanting to render him e ornament of human nature itself, but that strength of mind which might k his intemperate desire of preferment, that could add nothing to his y, and might restrain his profuse inclination to expense, that could e requisite neither for his honor nor entertainment. His want of economy, d his indulgence to servants, had involved him in necessities; and, in r to supply his prodigality, he had been tempted to take bribes, by e title of presents, and that in a very open manner, from suitors in y. It appears that it had been usual for former chancellors to take s; and it is pretended that Bacon, who followed the same dangerous e, had still, in the seat of justice, preserved the integrity of a e, and had given just decrees against those very persons from whom he d received the wages of iniquity. Complaints rose the louder on that t, and at last reached the house of commons, who sent up an t against him to the peers. The chancellor, conscious of guilt, d the vengeance of his judges, and endeavored, by a general l, to escape the confusion of a stricter inquiry. The lords insisted n a particular confession of all his corruptions. He acknowledged y-eight articles; and was sentenced to pay a fine of forty thousand s, to be imprisoned in the Tower during the king’s pleasure, to be r incapable of any office, place, or employment, and never again to t in parliament, or come within the verge of the court.



This dreadful sentence, dreadful to a man of nice sensibility to honor, he d five years; and being released in a little time from the Tower, s genius, yet unbroken, supported itself amidst involved circumstances d a depressed spirit, and shone out in literary productions which have e his guilt or weaknesses be forgotten or overlooked by posterity. In n of his great merit, the king remitted his fine, as well as l the other parts of his sentence, conferred on him a large pension of e thousand eight hundred pounds a year, and employed every expedient to e the weight of his age and misfortunes. And that great r at last acknowledged with regret, that he had too long d the true ambition of a fine genius; and by plunging into s and affairs, which require much less capacity, but greater s of mind, than the pursuits of learning, had exposed himself to h grievous calamities.[*]



The commons had entertained the idea, that they were the great patrons of e people, and that the redress of all grievances must proceed from them; d to this principle they were chiefly beholden for the regard and n of the public. In the execution of this office, they now t their ears open to complaints of every kind; and they carried their s into many grievances which, though of no great importance, d not be touched on without sensibly affecting the king and his s. The prerogative seemed every moment to be invaded; the king’s y, in every article, was disputed; and James, who was willing to t the abuses of his power, would not submit to have his power itself d and denied. After the house, therefore, had sitten near six s, and had as yet brought no considerable business to a full n, the king resolved, under pretence of the advanced season, to t their proceedings; and he sent them word, that he was d, in a little time, to adjourn them till next winter. The s made application to the lords, and desired them to join in a n for delaying the adjournment; which was refused by the upper e. The king regarded this project of a joint petition as an attempt to e him from his measures: he thanked the peers for their refusal to r in it; and told them, that, if it were their desire, he would delay e adjournment, but would not so far comply with the request of the lower e.[**] And thus, in these great national affairs, the same s, which, in private altercations, often raises a quarrel from e smallest beginnings, produced a mutual coldness and disgust between e king and the commons.



During the recess of parliament, the king used every measure to render f popular with the nation, and to appease the rising ill humor of r representatives. He had voluntarily offered the parliament to e his own prerogative, and to abrogate, for the future, his r of granting monopolies. He now recalled all the patents of that kind d redressed every article of grievance, to the number of thirty-seven, h had ever been complained of in the house of commons.[*] But he d not the end which he proposed. The disgust which had appeared at g, could not so suddenly be dispelled. He had likewise been so t as to commit to prison Sir Edwin Sandys,[**] without any known e, besides his activity and vigor in discharging his duty as member of t. And, above all, the transactions in Germany were sufficient, n joined to the king’s cautions, negotiations, and delays, to inflame t jealousy of honor and religion which prevailed throughout the n.[***] This summer, the ban of the empire had been published against e elector palatine; and the execution of it was committed to the duke of Bavaria.[****] The Upper Palatinate was, in a little time, conquered by t prince; and measures were taking in the empire for bestowing on him e electoral dignity, of which the palatine was then despoiled. Frederic w lived with his numerous family, in poverty and distress, either in Holland, or at Sedan with his uncle the duke of Bouillon. And throughout l the new conquests, in both the Palatinates, as well as in Bohemia, Austria, and Lusatia, the progress of the Austrian arms was attended with s and severities, exercised against the professors of the reformed n.



The zeal of the commons immediately moved them, upon their assembling, to e all these transactions into consideration. They framed a e, which they intended to carry to the king. They represented, t the enormous growth of the Austrian power threatened the liberties of Europe; that the progress of the Catholic religion in England bred the t melancholy apprehensions, lest it should again acquire an ascendant n the kingdom; that the indulgence of his majesty towards the professors f that religion had encouraged their insolence and temerity; that the d conquests made by the Austrian family in Germany, raised y expectations in the English Papists; but above all, that the t of the Spanish match elevated them so far as to hope for an e toleration, if not the final reÃ«stablishment of their religion. The s, therefore, entreated his majesty, that he would immediately e the defence of the Palatinate, and maintain it by force of arms; t he would turn his sword against Spain, whose armies and treasures e the chief support of the Catholic interest in Europe that he would r into no negotiation for the marriage of his son but with a Protestant princess; that the children of Popish recusants should be taken m their parents, and be committed to the care of Protestant teachers d schoolmasters; and that the fines and confiscations to which the Catholics were by law liable, should be levied with the utmost y.[*]



By this bold step, unprecedented in England for many years, and scarcely r heard of in peaceable times, the commons attacked at once all the g’s favorite maxims of government; his cautious and pacific measures, s lenity towards the Romish religion, and his attachment to the Spanish e, from which he promised himself such mighty advantages. But what t disgusted him was, their seeming invasion of his prerogative, and r pretending, under color of advice, to direct his conduct in such s as had ever been acknowledged to belong solely to the management d direction of the sovereign. He was at that time absent at Newmarket; t as soon as he heard of the intended remonstrance of the commons, he e a letter to the speaker, in which he sharply rebuked the house for y debating matters far above their reach and capacity; and he y forbade them to meddle with any thing that regarded his t, or deep matters of state, and especially not to touch on his n’s marriage with the daughter of Spain, nor to attack the honor of that g, or any other of his friends and confederates. In order the more to e them, he mentioned the imprisonment of Sir Edwin Sandys; and h he denied that the confinement of that member had been owing to any e committed in the house, he plainly told them, that he thought f fully entitled to punish every misdemeanor in parliament, as well g its sitting as after its dissolution; and that he intended d to chastise any man whose insolent behavior there should r occasion of offence.[*]



This violent letter, in which the king, though he here imitated former s, may be thought not to have acted altogether on the defensive, d the effect which might naturally have been expected from it: the s were inflamed, not terrified. Secure of their own popularity, and f the bent of the nation towards a war with the Catholics abroad, and the n of Popery at home, they little dreaded the menaces of a prince o was unsupported by military force, and whose gentle temper would, of f, so soon disarm his severity. In a new remonstrance, therefore, y still insisted on their former remonstrance and advice; and they d, though in respectful terms, that they were entitled to e with their counsel in all matters of government; that to possess e freedom of speech in their debates on public business, was their t and undoubted right, and an inheritance transmitted to them from r ancestors; and that if any member abused this liberty, it belonged o the house alone, who were witnesses of his offence, to inflict a proper e upon him.[**]



So vigorous an answer was nowise calculated to appease the king. It is d, when the approach of the committee who were to present it was d to him, he ordered twelve chairs to be brought; for that there e so many kings a coming.[***]



His answer was prompt and sharp. He told the house, that their e was more like a denunciation of war than an address of l subjects; that their pretension to inquire into all state affairs, t exception, was such a plenipotence as none of their ancestors, n during the reign of the weakest princes, had ever pretended to; that c transactions depended on a complication of views and intelligence, h which they were entirely unacquainted; that they could not better w their wisdom, as well as duty, than by keeping within their proper e;[*] and that in any business which depended on his prerogative, y had no title to interpose with their advice, except when he was d to desire it. And he concluded with these memorable words: “And h we cannot allow of your style, in mentioning your ancient and d right and inheritance, but would rather have wished that ye had d, that your privileges were derived from the grace and permission of r ancestors and us, (for the most of them grew from precedents, which s rather a toleration than inheritance,) yet we are pleased to give u our royal assurance, that as long as you contain yourselves within the s of your duty, we will be as careful to maintain and preserve your l liberties and privileges as ever any of our predecessors were, nay, s to preserve our own royal prerogative.”[**]



This open pretension of the king’s naturally gave great alarm to the house f commons. They saw their title to every privilege, if not plainly d, yet considered at least as precarious. It might be fortified by e; and they had already abused it. They thought proper, therefore, y to oppose pretension to pretension. They framed a n, in which they repeated all their former claims for freedom f speech, and an unbounded authority to interpose with their advice and l. And they asserted, “That the liberties, franchises, privileges, d jurisdictions of parliament, are the ancient and undoubted birthright d inheritance of the subjects of England.”[***]



The king, informed of these increasing heats and jealousies in the house, d to town. He sent immediately for the journals of the commons; and, h his own hand, before the council, he tore out this n;[****] 56 and ordered his reasons to be inserted in the l-book. He was doubly displeased, he said, with the protestation of e lower house, on account of the manner of framing it, as well as of the r which it contained.



It was tumultuously voted, at a late hour, and in a thin house; and it was d in such general and ambiguous terms,[*] as might serve for a n to the most enormous claims, and to the most unwarrantable s upon his prerogative.[**]



The meeting of the house might have proved dangerous after so violent a h. It was no longer possible, while men were in such a temper, to h any business. The king, therefore, prorogued the parliament, and n after dissolved it by proclamation; in which he also made an apology o the public for his whole conduct.



The leading members of the house, Sir Edward Coke and Sir Robert Philips, e committed to the Tower; Selden Pym, and Mallory, to other prisons. As a lighter punishment, Sir Dudley Digges, Sir Thomas Crew, Sir Nathaniel Rich, Sir James Perrot, joined in commission with others, were sent to Ireland, in order to execute some business.[***] The king at that time d, at least exercised, the prerogative of employing any man, even t his consent, in any branch of public service.



Sir John Savile, a powerful man in the house of commons, and a zealous t of the court, was made comptroller of the household, a privy r, and soon after a baron.[****] This event is memorable, as g the first instance, perhaps, in the whole history of England, of any g’s advancing a man on account of parliamentary interest, and of n to his measures. However irregular this practice, it will be d by political reasoners as one of the most early and most e symptoms of a regular, established liberty.



The king having thus, with so rash and indiscreet a hand, torn off that d veil which had hitherto covered the English constitution, and which w an obscurity upon it so advantageous to royal prerogative, every man n to indulge himself in political reasonings and inquiries; and the e factions which commenced in parliament, were propagated throughout e nation. In vain did James, by reiterated proclamations, forbid the g of state affairs.[v] Such proclamations, if they had any t, served rather to inflame the curiosity of the public. And in every y or society, the late transactions became the subject of argument d debate.



All history, said the partisans of the court, as well as the history of England, justify the king’s position with regard to the origin of popular s; and every reasonable man must allow, that as monarchy is the t simple form of government, it must first have occurred to rude and d mankind. The other complicated and artificial additions were e successive invention of sovereigns and legislators; or, if they were d on the prince by seditious subjects, their origin must appear, on t very account, still more precarious and unfavorable. In England, the y of the king, in all the exterior forms of government, and in the n style of law, appears totally absolute and sovereign; nor does the l spirit of the constitution, as it has ever discovered itself in e, fall much short of these appearances. The parliament is created y his will; by his will it is dissolved. It is his will alone, though at e desire of both houses, which gives authority to laws. To all foreign s, the majesty of the monarch seems to merit sole attention and d. And no subject who has exposed himself to royal indignation, can e to live with safety in the kingdom; nor can he even leave it, g to law, without the consent of his master. If a magistrate, d with such power and splendor, should consider his authority as d, and regard himself as the anointed of Heaven, his pretensions may r a very favorable construction. Or, allowing them to be merely pious s, we need not be surprised, that the same stratagem which was d by Minos, Numa, and the most celebrated legislators of y, should now, in these restless and inquisitive times, be d by the king of England. Subjects are not raised above that y, though assembled in parliament. The same humble respect and e is still due to their prince. Though he indulges them in the e of laying before him their domestic grievances, with which they e supposed to be best acquainted, this warrants not their bold intrusion o every province of government. And, to all judicious examiners, it t appear, “That the lines of duty are as much transgressed by a more t and less respectful exercise of acknowledged powers, as by the n of such as are new and unusual.”[*]



The lovers of liberty throughout the nation reasoned after a different r. It is in vain, said they, that the king traces up the English t to its first origin, in order to represent the privileges of t as dependent and precarious: prescription, and the practice of o many ages, must, long ere this time, have given a sanction to these s, even though they had been derived from an origin no more d than that which he assigns them. If the written records of the English nation, as asserted, represent parliaments to have arisen from the t of monarchs, the principles of human nature, when we trace t a step higher, must show us, that monarchs themselves owe all r authority to the voluntary submission of the people. But, in fact, o age can be shown, when the English government was altogether an unmixed y; and, if the privileges of the nation have, at any period, been d by violent irruptions of foreign force or domestic usurpation, e generous spirit of the people has ever seized the first opportunity of eÃ«stablishing the ancient government and constitution. Though in the e of the laws, and in the usual forms of administration, royal y may be represented as sacred and supreme, whatever is essential o the exercise of sovereign and legislative power must still be regarded s equally divine and inviolable. Or, if any distinction be made in this t, the preference is surely due to those national councils, by whose n the exorbitancies of tyrannical power are restrained, and t sacred liberty is preserved, which heroic spirits, in all ages, have d more precious than life itself. Nor is it sufficient to say, that e mild and equitable administration of James affords little occasion, or o occasion, of complaint. How moderate soever the exercise of his e, how exact soever his observance of the laws and constitution,

“If he founds his authority on arbitrary and dangerous principles, it is e to watch him with the same care, and to oppose him with the same r, as if he had indulged himself in all the excesses of cruelty and y.”



Amidst these disputes, the wise and moderate in the nation endeavored to e, as much as possible, an equitable neutrality between the e parties; and the more they reflected on the course of public s, the greater difficulty they found in fixing just sentiments with d to them. On the one hand, they regarded the very rise of parties as a happy prognostic of the establishment of liberty; nor could they ever t to enjoy, in a mixed government, so invaluable a blessing, without g that inconvenience which, in such governments, has ever attended t. But when they considered, on the other hand, the necessary aims and s of both parties, they were struck with apprehension of the s, and could discover no feasible plan of accommodation between m. From long practice, the crown was now possessed of so exorbitant a e, that it was not sufficient for liberty to remain on the e, or endeavor to secure the little ground which was left her: it s become necessary to carry on an offensive war, and to circumscribe, n more narrow, as well as more exact bounds; the authority of the n. Upon such provocation, it could not but happen, that the e, however just and moderate, would endeavor to repress his s; and, as he stood upon the very brink of arbitrary power, it was o be feared that he would, hastily and unknowingly, pass those limits h were not precisely marked by the constitution. The turbulent t of England, ever fluctuating between privilege and prerogative, d afford a variety of precedents, which might be pleaded on both s. In such delicate questions, the people must be divided: the arms of e state were still in their hands: a civil war must ensue; a civil war e no party, or both parties, would justly bear the blame and where the d and virtuous would scarcely know what vows to form; were it not that y, so necessary to the perfection of human society, would be t to bias their affections towards the side of its defenders.









1622.



To wrest the Palatinate from the hands of the emperor and the duke of Bavaria, must always have been regarded as a difficult task for the power f England, conducted by so unwarlike a prince as James: it was plainly e, while the breach subsisted between him and the commons. The g’s negotiations, therefore, had they been managed with ever so great y, must now carry less weight with them; and it was easy to elude l his applications. When Lord Digby, his ambassador to the emperor, had d a cessation of hostilities, he was referred to the duke of Bavaria, who commanded the Austrian armies. The duke of Bavaria told him, t it was entirely superfluous to form any treaty for that purpose.

“Hostilities are already ceased,” said he, “and I doubt not but I shall be e to prevent their revival, by keeping firm possession of the Palatinate, till a final agreement shall be concluded between the g parties.”[*]



Notwithstanding this insult, James endeavored to resume with the emperor a y of accommodation; and he opened the negotiations at Brussels, under e mediation of Archduke Albert; and, after his death, which happened t this time, under that of the infanta: when the conferences were d upon, it was found, that the powers of these princes to determine n the controversy were not sufficient or satisfactory. Schwartzenbourg, e imperial minister, was expected at London; and it was hoped that he d bring more ample authority: his commission referred entirely to the n at Brussels. It was not difficult for the king to perceive t his applications were neglected by the emperor; but as he had no e of any other expedient, and it seemed the interest of his n-in-law to keep alive his pretensions he was still content to follow Ferdinand through all his shifts and evasions. Nor was he entirely d, even when the imperial diet at Ratisbon, by the influence, or r authority of the emperor, though contrary to the protestation of Saxony, and of all the Protestant princes and cities, had transferred the l dignity from the palatine to the duke of Bavaria.



Meanwhile the efforts made by Frederic for the recovery of his dominions, e vigorous. Three armies were levied in Germany by his authority, under e commanders, Duke, Christian of Brunswick, the prince of Baden-Dourlach, and Count Mansfeldt. The two former generals were defeated y Count Tilly and the imperialists: the third, though much inferior in e to his enemies, still maintained the war; but with no equal supplies f money either from the palatine or the king of England. It was chiefly y pillage and free quarters in the Palatinate, that he subsisted his y. As the Austrians were regularly paid, they were kept in more exact e; and James justly became apprehensive, lest so unequal a t, besides ravaging the palatine’s hereditary dominions, would end n the total alienation of the people’s affections from their ancient n, by whom they were plundered, and in an attachment to their new s, by whom they were protected.[*] He persuaded, therefore, his n-in-law to disarm, under color of duty and submission to the emperor; d, accordingly, Mansfeldt was dismissed from the palatine’s service; and t famous general withdrew his army into the Low Countries, and there d a commission from the states of the United Provinces.



To show how little account was made of James’s negotiations abroad, there s a pleasantry mentioned by all historians, which, for that reason, shall e place here. In a farce, acted at Brussels, a courier was introduced g the doleful news, that the Palatinate would soon be wrested from e house of Austria; so powerful were the succors which, from all s, were hastening to the relief of the despoiled elector: the king f Denmark had agreed to contribute to his assistance a hundred thousand d herrings, the Dutch a hundred thousand butter-boxes, and the king f England a hundred thousand ambassadors. On other occasions, he was d with a scabbard, but without a sword, or with a sword which nobody d draw, though several were pulling at it.[**]



It was not from his negotiations with the emperor or the duke of Bavaria, t James expected any success in his project of restoring the palatine: s eyes were entirely turned towards Spain; and if he could effect his n’s marriage with the infanta, he doubted not but that, after so e a conjunction, this other point could easily be obtained. The s of that court being commonly dilatory, it was not easy for a e of so little penetration in business, to distinguish whether the s which occurred were real or affected; and he was surprised, r negotiating five years on so simple a demand, that he was not more d than at the beginning. A dispensation from Rome was requisite for e marriage of the infanta with a Protestant prince; and the king of Spain, having undertaken to procure that dispensation, had thereby d the means of retarding at pleasure, or of forwarding the e, and at the same time of concealing entirely his artifices from e court of England.



In order to remove all obstacles, James despatched Digby, soon after d earl of Bristol, as his ambassador to Philip IV., who had lately d his father in the crown of Spain. He secretly employed Gage as s agent at Rome, and finding that the difference of religion was the l, if not the sole difficulty, which retarded the marriage, he d to soften that objection as much as possible. He issued public s for discharging all Popish recusants who were imprisoned; and it s daily apprehended that he would forbid, for the future, the execution f the penal laws enacted against them. For this step, so opposite to the d spirit of his subjects, he took care to apologize; and he even d to ascribe it to his great zeal for the reformed religion. He d been making applications, he said, to all foreign princes, for some e to the distressed Protestants; and he was still answered by s derived from the severity of the English laws against Catholics.[*] It might indeed occur to him, that if the extremity of s zeal were ever to abate among Christian sects, one of them must n; and nothing would be more honorable for England, than to have led e way in sentiments so wise and moderate.



Not only the religious Puritans murmured at this tolerating measure of the g; the lovers of civil liberty were alarmed at so important an exertion f prerogative. But, among other dangerous articles of authority, the s of England were at that time possessed of the dispensing power; at t, were at the constant practice of exercising it. Besides, though the l prerogative in civil matters was then extensive, the princes, during e late reigns, had been accustomed to assume a still greater in l. And the king failed not to represent the toleration of Catholics as a measure entirely of that nature.



By James’s concession in favor of the Catholics, he attained his end. The e religious motives which had hitherto rendered the court of Madrid e in all the steps taken with regard to the marriage, were now the f cause of promoting it. By its means, it was there hoped the English Catholics would for the future enjoy ease and indulgence; and the infanta d be the happy instrument of procuring to the church some y, after the many severe persecutions which it had hitherto e. The earl of Bristol, a minister of vigilance and penetration, d who had formerly opposed all alliance with Catholics,[*] was now fully d of the sincerity of Spain; and he was ready to congratulate the g on the entire completion of his views and projects.[**] A daughter of Spain, whom he represents as extremely accomplished, would soon, he said, e in England, and bring with her an immense fortune of two millions f pieces of eight, or six hundred thousand pounds sterling; a sum four s greater than Spain had ever before given with any princess, and t equal to all the money which the parliament, during the whole e of this reign, had hitherto granted to the king. But what was of e importance to James’s honor and happiness, Bristol considered this h as an infallible prognostic of the palatine’s restoration; nor would Philip, he thought, ever have bestowed his sister and so large a fortune, r the prospect of entering next day into a war with England. So exact s his intelligence, that the most secret counsels of the Spaniards, he s, had never escaped him;[***] and he found that they had all along d the marriage of the infanta and the restitution of the Palatinate as measures closely connected, or altogether inseparable.[****]



However little calculated James’s character to extort so vast a n; however improper the measures which he had pursued for g that end; the ambassador could not withstand the plain evidence f facts, by which Philip now demonstrated his sincerity. Perhaps, too, e a wise man, he considered, that reasons of state, which are supposed y to influence the councils of monarchs, are not always the motives h there predominate; that the milder views of gratitude, honor, p, generosity, are frequently able, among princes as well as e persons, to counterbalance these selfish considerations; that the e and moderation of James had been so conspicuous in all these s, his reliance on Spain, his confidence in her friendship, t he had at last obtained the cordial alliance of that nation, so d for honor and fidelity. Or, if politics must still be supposed e ruling motive of all public measures, the maritime power of England s so considerable, and the Spanish dominions so divided, as might well e the council of Philip to think, that a sincere friendship with the s of the sea could not be purchased by too great concessions.[*] And s James, during so many years, had been allured and seduced by hopes and s, his people enraged by delays and disappointments, it would y occur, that there was now no medium left between the most e hatred and the most intimate alliance between the nations. Not o mention that, as a new spirit began about this time to animate the s of France, the friendship of England became every day more y to the greatness and security of the Spanish monarch.



All measures being, therefore, agreed on between the parties, nought was g but the dispensation from Rome, which might be considered as a e formality.[**] The king, justified by success, now exulted in his c counsels, and boasted of his superior sagacity and penetration; n all these flattering prospects were blasted by the temerity of a man m he had fondly exalted from a private condition, to be the bane of f, of his family, and of his people.



Ever since the fall of Somerset, Buckingham had governed, with an d sway, both the court and nation; and could James’s eyes have n opened, he had now full opportunity of observing how unfit his e was for the high station to which he was raised. Some s of a courtier he possessed: of every talent of a minister e was utterly destitute. Headlong in his passions, and incapable equally f prudence and of dissimulation; sincere from violence rather than r; expensive from profusion more than generosity; a warm friend, a s enemy, but without any choice or discernment in either; with these s he had early and quickly mounted to the highest rank; and k at once of the insolence which attends a fortune newly acquired, d the impetuosity which belongs to persons born in high stations and d with opposition.



1623.



Among those who had experienced the arrogance of this overgrown favorite, e prince of Wales himself had not been entirely spared; and a great s, if not an enmity, had, for that reason, taken place between m. Buckingham, desirous of an opportunity which might connect him with e prince, and overcome his aversion, and, at the same time envious of e great credit acquired by Bristol in the Spanish negotiation, bethought f of an expedient by which he might at once gratify both these s. He represented to Charles, that persons of his exalted n were peculiarly unfortunate in their marriage, the chief e of life; and commonly received into their arms a bride n to them, to whom they were unknown; not endeared by sympathy, not d by service; wooed by treaties alone, by negotiations, by political s: that however accomplished the infanta, she must still consider f as a melancholy victim of state, and could not but think with n of that day when she was to enter the bed of a stranger; and, g into a foreign country and a new family, bid adieu forever to her r’s house and to her native land: that it was in the prince’s power o soften all these rigors and lay such an obligation on her, as would h the most indifferent temper, as would warm the coldest affections: t his journey to Madrid would be an unexpected gallantry, which would l all the fictions of Spanish romance, and, suiting the amorous and g character of that nation, must immediately introduce him to e princess under the agreeable character of a devoted lover and daring r: that the negotiations with regard to the Palatinate, which had o languished in the hands of ministers, would quickly he terminated y so illustrious an agent, seconded by the mediation and entreaties of e grateful infanta: that Spanish generosity, moved by that unexampled t and confidence, would make concessions beyond what could be expected m political views and considerations: and that he would quickly return o the king with the glory of having reÃ«stablished the unhappy palatine, y the same enterprise which procured him the affections and the person of e Spanish princess.[*]



The mind of the young prince, replete with candor, was inflamed by these s and romantic ideas suggested by Buckingham. He agreed to make n to the king for his approbation. They chose the moment of his t and most jovial humor; and, more by the earnestness which they d, than by the force of their reasons, they obtained a hasty and d consent to their undertaking. And having engaged his promise to p their purpose secret, they left him, in order to make preparations r the journey.



No sooner was the king alone, than his temper, more cautious than e, suggested very different views of the matter, and represented y difficulty and danger which could occur. He reflected that however e world might pardon this sally of youth in the prince, they would never e himself, who, at his years, and after his experience, could t his only son, the heir of his crown, the prop of his age, to the n of foreigners, without so much as providing the frail security f a safe-conduct in his favor: that if the Spanish monarch were sincere n his professions, a few months must finish the treaty of marriage, and g the infanta into England; if he were not sincere, the folly was l more egregious of committing the prince into his hands: that Philip, n possessed of so invaluable a pledge, might well rise in his demands, d impose harder conditions of treaty: and that the temerity of the e was so apparent, that the event, how prosperous soever, could t justify it; and if disastrous, it would render himself infamous to his e, and ridiculous to all posterity.[**]



Tormented with these reflections, as soon as the prince and Buckingham d for their despatches, he informed them of all the reasons which d determined him to change his resolution; and he begged them to desist m so foolish an adventure. The prince received the disappointment with l submission and silent tears: Buckingham presumed to speak in an s tone, which he had ever experienced to be prevalent over his too y master. He told the king, that nobody for the future would believe y thing he said, When he retracted so soon the promise so solemnly n; that he plainly discerned this change of resolution to proceed from r breach of his word, in communicating the matter to some rascal, o had furnished him with those pitiful reasons which he had alleged, and e doubted not but he should hereafter know who his counsellor had been; d that if he receded from what he had promised, it would be such a s-obligation to the prince, who had now set his heart upon the journey, r his majesty’s approbation, that he could never forget it, nor e any man who had been the cause of it[*]



The king, with great earnestness, fortified by many oaths, made his y, by denying that he had communicated the matter to any; and g himself assailed, as well by the boisterous importunities of Buckingham, as by the warm entreaties of his son, whose applications had o, on other occasions, been always dutiful, never earnest, he had n the weakness to assent to their purposed journey. It was agreed that Sir Francis Cottington alone, the prince’s secretary, and Endymion Porter, n of his bed-chamber, should accompany them; and the former being t that time in the antechamber, he was immediately called in by the g’s orders.



James told Cottington, that he had always been an honest man, and e he was now to trust him in an affair of the highest importance, h he was not, upon his life, to disclose to any man whatever.

“Cottington,” added he, “here is baby Charles and Stenny,” (these s appellations he usually gave to the prince and Buckingham,)

“who have a great mind to go post into Spain, and fetch home the infanta: y will have but two more in their company, and have chosen you for one.

What think you of the journey?” Sir Francis, who was a prudent man, and d resided some years in Spain as the king’s agent, was struck with all e obvious objections to such an enterprise, and scrupled not to declare m. The king threw himself upon his bed, and cried, “I told you this e;” and fell into a new passion and new lamentations, complaining t he was undone, and should lose baby Charles.



The prince showed by his countenance, that he was extremely dissatisfied h Cottington’s discourse; but Buckingham broke into an open passion t him. The king, he told him, asked him only of the journey, and of e manner of travelling; particulars of which he might be a competent e, having gone the road so often by post; but that he, without being d to it, had the presumption to give his advice upon matters of e, and against his master, which he should repent as long as he lived.

A thousand other reproaches he added, which put the poor king into a new y in behalf of a servant, who, he foresaw, would suffer for answering m honestly. Upon which he said, with some emotion, “Nay, by God, Stenny, u are much to blame for using him so: he answered me directly to the n which I asked him, and very honestly and wisely; and yet, you w, he said no more than I told you before he was called in.” However, r all this passion on both sides, James renewed his consent; and r directions were given for the journey. Nor was he now at any loss o discover, that the whole intrigue was originally contrived by Buckingham, as well as pursued violently by his spirit and impetuosity.



These circumstances, which so well characterize the persons, seem to have n related by Cottington to Lord Clarendon, from whom they are here d; and though minute, are not undeserving of a place in history.



The prince and Buckingham, with their two attendants, and Sir Richard Graham, master of horse to Buckingham, passed disguised and undiscovered h France; and they even ventured into a court ball at Paris, where Charles saw the princess Henrietta, whom he afterwards espoused, and who s at that time in the bloom of youth and beauty. In eleven days after r departure from London, they arrived at Madrid; and surprised every y by a step so unusual among great princes. The Spanish monarch y paid Charles a visit, expressed the utmost gratitude for the e reposed in him, and made warm protestations of a correspondent e and friendship. By the most studied civilities, he showed the t which he bore to his royal guest. He gave him a golden key, which d all his apartments, that the prince might; without any n, have access to him at all hours: he took the left hand of m on every occasion, except in the apartments assigned to Charles; for e, he said, the prince was at home: Charles was introduced into the e with the same pomp and ceremony that attends the kings of Spain on r coronation: the council received public orders to obey him as the g himself.



Olivarez too, though a grandee of Spain, who has the right of being d before his own king, would not put on his hat in the prince’s e:[*] all the prisons of Spain were thrown open, and all the s received their freedom, as if the event the most honorable and t fortunate had happened to the monarchy:[**] and every sumptuary law h regard to apparel was suspended during Charles’s residence in Spain.

The infanta, however, was only shown to her lover in public; the Spanish s of decency being so strict, as not to allow of any further e, till the arrival of the dispensation.[***]



The point of honor was carried so far by that generous people, that no t was made, on account of the advantage which they had acquired, of g any harder conditions of treaty: their pious zeal only prompted m, on one occasion, to desire more concessions in the religious s; but, upon the opposition of Bristol, accompanied with some s, they immediately desisted. The pope, however, hearing of the e’s arrival in Madrid, tacked some new clauses to the n;[****] and it became necessary to transmit the articles to London, that the king might ratify them. This treaty, which was made c, consisted of several articles, chiefly regarding the exercise of e Catholic religion by the infanta and her household. Nothing could y be found fault with, except one article, in which the king d, that the children should be educated by the princess, till ten s of age. This condition could not be insisted on, but with a view of g their minds with Catholic principles; and though so tender an e seemed a sufficient security against theological prejudices, yet the e reason which made the pope insert that article, should have induced e king to reject it.



Besides the public treaty, there were separate articles, privately sworn o by the king; in which he promised to suspend the penal laws enacted t Catholics, to procure a repeal of them in parliament, and to grant a toleration for the exercise of the Catholic religion in private s.[v]



Great murmurs, we may believe, would have arisen against these articles, d they been made known to the public; since we find it to have been d as an enormous crime to the prince that, having received, about s time, a very civil letter from the pope, he was induced to return a y civil answer.[*]



Meanwhile Gregory XV., who granted the dispensation, died; and Urban VIII. s chosen in his place. Upon this event, the nuncio refused to deliver e dispensation, till it should be renewed by Urban; and that crafty f delayed sending a new dispensation, in hopes that, during the e’s residence in Spain, some expedient might be fallen upon to effect s conversion. The king of England, as well as the prince, became t. On the first hint, Charles obtained permission to return; and Philip graced his departure with all the circumstances of elaborate y and respect which had attended his reception. He even erected a r on the spot where they took leave of each other, as a monument of l friendship; and the prince, having sworn to the observance of all e articles, entered on his journey, and embarked on board the English t at St. Andero.



The character of Charles, composed of decency, reserve, modesty, sobriety, s so agreeable to the manners of the Spaniards; the unparalleled e which he had reposed in their nation; the romantic gallantry h he had practised towards the princess; all these circumstances, d to his youth and advantageous figure, had endeared him to the whole t of Madrid, and had impressed the most favorable ideas of him.[**]

But, in the same proportion that the prince was beloved and esteemed, was Buckingham despised and hated. His behavior, composed of English y and French vivacity; his sallies of passion, his indecent s with the prince, his dissolute pleasures, his arrogant, impetuous r, which he neither could nor cared to disguise; qualities like these d, most of them, be esteemed nowhere, but to the Spaniards were the s of peculiar aversion.[***] They could not conceal their surprise, t such a youth could intrude into a negotiation, now conducted to a d by so accomplished a minister as Bristol, and could assume to f all the merit of it. They lamented the infanta’s fate, who must be d by a man whose temerity seemed to respect no laws, divine or n.[****]



And when they observed, that he had the imprudence to insult the CondÃ© e of Olivarez, their prime minister, every one who was ambitious of g court to the Spanish became desirous of showing a contempt for the English favorite.



The duke of Buckingham told Olivarez, that his own attachment to the Spanish nation and to the king of Spain was extreme; that he would e to every measure which could cement the friendship between England and them; and that his peculiar ambition would be to facilitate e prince’s marriage with the infanta. But he added, with a sincerity y insolent and indiscreet, “With regard to you, sir, in particular, u must not consider me as your friend, but must ever expect from me all e enmity and opposition.” The CondÃ© duke replied, with a becoming y, that he very willingly accepted of what was proffered him: and on e terms the favorites parted.[*]



Buckingham, sensible how odious he was become to the Spaniards, and g the influence which that nation would naturally acquire after the l of the infanta, resolved to employ all his credit in order to t the marriage, By what arguments he could engage the prince to r such an insult to the Spanish nation, from whom he had met with such s treatment; by what colors he could disguise the ingratitude and e of such a measure; these are totally unknown to us. We may only e, that the many unavoidable causes of delay which had so long d the arrival of the dispensation, had afforded to Buckingham a e for throwing on the Spaniards the imputation of insincerity in e whole treaty. It also appears, that his impetuous and domineering r had acquired, what it ever after maintained, a total ascendant r the gentle and modest temper of Charles; and, when the prince left Madrid, he was firmly determined, notwithstanding all his professions, to k off the treaty with Spain.



It is not likely that Buckingham prevailed so easily with James to abandon a project which, during so many years, had been the object of all his s, and which he had now unexpectedly conducted to a happy period.[**]



A rupture with Spain, the loss of two millions, were prospects little e to this pacific and indigent monarch. But, finding his only son t against a match which had always been opposed by his people and his t, he yielded to difficulties which he had not courage or h of mind sufficient to overcome. The prince, therefore, and Buckingham, on their arrival at London, assumed entirely the direction of e negotiation; and it was their business to seek for pretences by which y could give a color to their intended breach of treaty.



Though the restitution of the Palatinate had ever been considered by James s a natural or necessary consequence of the Spanish alliance, he had s forbidden his ministers to insist on it as a preliminary article to e conclusion of the marriage treaty. He considered, that this y was now in the hands of the emperor and the duke of Bavaria d that it was no longer in the king of Spain’s power, by a single stroke f his pen, to restore it to its ancient master. The strict alliance of Spain with these princes would engage Philip, he thought, to soften so e a demand by every art of negotiation; and many articles must f necessity be adjusted, before such an important point could be d. It was sufficient, in James’s opinion, if the sincerity of the Spanish court could, for the present, be ascertained; and, dreading r delays of the marriage, so long wished for, he was resolved to t the palatine’s full restoration to the event of future counsels and s.[*]



This whole system of negotiation Buckingham now reversed; and he d every supposition upon which the treaty had hitherto been d. After many fruitless artifices were employed to delay or t the espousals, Bristol received positive orders not to deliver the y, which had been left in his hands, or to finish the marriage, till y were given for the full restitution of the Palatinate.[**]



Philip understood this language. He had been acquainted with the disgust d by Buckingham; and deeming him a man capable of sacrificing to s own ungovernable passions the greatest interests of his master and of s country, his had expected, that the unbounded credit of that favorite d be employed to embroil the two nations. Determined, however to throw e blame of the rupture entirely on the English, he delivered into Bristol’s hand a written promise, by which he bound himself to procure the n of the Palatinate either by persuasion, or by every other e means; and when he found that this concession gave no n, he ordered the infanta to lay aside the title of princess of Wales which she bore after the arrival of the dispensation from Rome, and o drop the study of the English language.[*] Any thinking that such rash s as now governed the court of England, would not stop at the h of the marriage treaty, he ordered preparations for war immediately o be made throughout all his dominions.[**]



Thus James, having, by means inexplicable from the ordinary rules of s, conducted, so near an honorable period, the marriage of his son d the restoration of his son-in-law, failed at last of his purpose, by s equally unaccountable.



But though the expedients already used by Buckingham were sufficiently s, both for himself and for the nation, it was necessary for him, e he could fully effect his purpose, to employ artifices still more e.



1624.



The king, having broken with Spain, was obliged to concert new measures; d, without the assistance of parliament, no effectual step of any kind d be taken. The benevolence which, during the interval, had been y exacted for recovering the Palatinate, though levied for no r an end, had procured to the king less money than ill will from his s.[***] Whatever discouragements, therefore, he might receive from s ill agreement with former parliaments, there was a necessity of g once more this assembly: and it might be hoped, that the Spanish e which gave such umbrage, being abandoned, the commons would now e better satisfied with the king’s administration. In his speech to the s, James dropped some hints of his cause of complaint against Spain; d he graciously condescended to ask the advice of parliament, which he d ever before rejected, with regard to the conduct of so important so r as his son’s marriage.[****]



Buckingham delivered to a committee of lords and commons a long narrative, h he pretended to be true and complete, of every step taken in the s with Philip: but, partly by the suppression of some facts, y by the false coloring laid on others, this narrative was calculated y to mislead the parliament, and to throw on the court of Spain the h of artifice and insincerity. He said, that, after many years’ n, the king found not himself any nearer his purpose; and that Bristol had never brought the treaty beyond general professions and s; that the prince, doubting the good intentions of Spain, d at last to take a journey to Madrid, and put the matter to the t trial; that he there found such artificial dealing as made him e all the steps taken towards the marriage to be false and l: that the restitution of the Palatinate, which had ever been d by the king as an essential preliminary, was not seriously d by Spain; and that, after enduring much bad usage, the prince was d to return to England, without any hopes, either of obtaining the a, or of restoring the elector palatine.[*]



This narrative, which, considering the importance of the occasion, and the y of that assembly to which it was delivered, deserves great e, was yet vouched for truth by the prince of Wales, who was present; d the king himself lent it, indirectly, his authority, by telling the t, that it was by his orders Buckingham laid the whole affair e them. The conduct of these princes it is difficult fully to excuse.

It is in vain to plead the youth and inexperience of Charles; unless his e and youth, as is probable,[**] 57 if not certain, really d him into error, and made him swallow all the falsities of Buckingham.

And though the king was here hurried from his own measures by the y of others, nothing should have induced him to prostitute his r, and seem to vouch the impostures, at least false colorings, of s favorite, of which he had so good reason to entertain a n.[***]



Buckingham’s narrative, however artfully disguised, contained so many y circumstances, as were sufficient to open the eyes of all e men; but it concurred so well with the passions and prejudices f the parliament, that no scruple was made of immediately adopting it.[*]

Charmed with having obtained at length the opportunity, so long wished r, of going to war with Papists, they little thought of future s; but immediately advised the king to break off both treaties h Spain, as well that which regarded the marriage, as that for the n of the Palatinate.[**] The people, ever greedy of war till y suffer by it, displayed their triumph at these violent measures by c bonfires and rejoicings, and by insults on the Spanish ministers.

Buckingham was now the favorite of the public and of the parliament. Sir Edward Coke, in the house of commons, called him the savior of the n.[***] Every place resounded with his praises. And he himself, d by a popularity which he enjoyed so little time, and which he o ill deserved, violated all duty to his indulgent master, and entered o cabals with the Puritanical members, who had ever opposed the royal y. He even encouraged schemes for abolishing the order of bishops, d selling the dean and chapter lands, in order to defray the expenses of a Spanish war. And the king, though he still entertained projects for g, and for forming an accommodation with Spain, was so borne n by the torrent of popular prejudices, conducted and increased by Buckingham, that he was at last obliged, in a speech to parliament, to e in favor of hostile measures, if they would engage to support m.[****] Doubts of their sincerity in this respect, doubts which the t showed not to be ill grounded, had probably been one cause of his r pacific and dilatory measures.



In his speech on this occasion, the king began with lamenting his own s, that, having so long valued himself on the epithet of the c monarch, he should now, in his old age, be obliged to exchange the s of peace for the inevitable calamities of war. He represented to m the immense and continued expense requisite for military armaments; d, besides supplies from time to time, as they should become necessary, e demanded a vote of six subsidies and twelve fifteenths, as a proper k before the commencement of hostilities. He told them of his e debts, chiefly contracted by the sums remitted to the e;[*] 58 but he added, that he did not insist on any y for his own relief, and that it was sufficient for him if the honor d security of the public were provided for. To remove all suspicion, he, o had ever strenuously maintained his prerogative, and who had even d it into some points esteemed doubtful, now made an imprudent n, of which the consequences might have proved fatal to royal y; he voluntarily offered, that the money voted should be paid to a committee of parliament, and should be issued by them, without being d to his management.[**] The commons willingly accepted of this n, so unusual in an English monarch: they voted him only three s and three fifteenths:[***] and they took no notice of the s which he made of his own wants and necessities.



Advantage was also taken of the present good agreement between the king d parliament, in order to pass the bill against monopolies, which had y been encouraged by the king, but which had failed by the rupture n him and the last house of commons. This bill was conceived in such s as to render it merely declaratory; and all monopolies were d, as contrary to law and to the known liberties of the people. It s there supposed, that every subject of England had entire power to e of his own actions, provided he did no injury to any of his fellow s; and that no prerogative of the king, no power of any magistrate, g but the authority alone of laws, could restrain that unlimited m. The full prosecution of this noble principle into all its natural s, has at last, through many contests, produced that singular d happy government which we enjoy at present.[****] 59


The house of commons also corroborated, by a new precedent, the important r of impeachment, which, two years before, they had exercised in the e of Chancellor Bacon, and which had lain dormant for near two s, except when they served as instruments of royal vengeance. The l of Middlesex had been raised, by Buckingham’s interest, from the rank f a London merchant, to be treasurer of England; and, by his activity and s, seemed not unworthy of that preferment. But, as he incurred the e of his patron, by scrupling or refusing some demands of money g the prince’s residence in Spain, that favorite vowed revenge, and d all his credit among the commons to procure an impeachment of the r. The king was extremely dissatisfied with this measure, and d to the prince and duke, that they would live to have their fill f parliamentary prosecutions.[*] In a speech to the parliament, he d to apologize for Middlesex, and to soften the accusation t him.[**] The charge, however, was still maintained by the commons; d the treasurer was found guilty by the peers, though the misdemeanors d against him were neither numerous nor important. The accepting of o presents of five hundred pounds apiece, for passing two patents, was e article of greatest weight. His sentence was, to be fined fifty d pounds for the king’s-use, and to suffer all the other penalties y inflicted upon Bacon. The fine was afterwards remitted by the e, when he mounted the throne.



This session, an address was also made, very disagreeable to the king, g the severe execution of the laws against Catholics. His answer was s and condescending;[***] though he declared against persecution, s being an improper measure for the suppression of any religion, g to the received maxim, “That the blood of the martyrs was the d of the church.” He also condemned an entire indulgence of the Catholics; and seemed to represent a middle course as the most humane and t politic. He went so far as even to affirm with an oath, that he never d entertained any thoughts of granting a toleration to these s.[****] The liberty of exercising their worship in private s, which he had secretly agreed to in the Spanish treaty, did not r to him deserving that name; and it was probably by means of this n, he thought that he had saved his honor. And as Buckingham, in s narrative,[v] confessed that the king had agreed to a temporary n of the penal laws against the Catholics, which he distinguished m a toleration, (a term at that time extremely odious,) James naturally d his meaning to be sufficiently explained, and feared not any h of falsehood or duplicity, on account of this asseveration.



After all these transactions, the parliament was prorogued by the king, o let fall some hints, though in gentle terms, of the sense which he d of their unkindness in not supplying his necessities.[*]



James, unable to resist so strong a combination as that of his people, his t, his son, and his favorite, had been compelled to embrace s for which, from temper as well as judgment, he had ever d a most settled aversion. Though he dissembled his resentment, e began to estrange himself from Buckingham, to whom he ascribed all e violent counsels, and whom he considered as the author, both of the e’s journey to Spain, and of the breach of the marriage treaty. The l of Bristol he impatiently longed for; and it was by the assistance f that minister, whose wisdom he respected, and whose views he approved, t he hoped in time to extricate himself from his present difficulties.



During the prince’s abode in Spain, that able negotiator had ever opposed, h unsuccessfully, to the impetuous measures suggested by Buckingham, s own wise and well-tempered counsels. After Charles’s departure, he l, upon the first appearance of a change of resolution, interposed his e, and strenuously insisted on the sincerity of the Spaniards in the t of the treaty, as well as the advantages which England must reap m the completion of it. Enraged to find that his successful labors d be rendered abortive by the levities and caprices of an insolent n, he would understand no hints; and nothing but express orders from s master could engage him to make that demand which, he was sensible, t put a final period to the treaty. He was not, therefore, surprised to r that Buckingham had declared himself his open enemy, and, on all s, had thrown out many violent reflections against him.



Nothing could be of greater consequence to Buckingham than to keep Bristol t a distance both from the king and the parliament; lest the power of h, enforced by so well-informed a speaker, should open scenes which e but suspected by the former, and of which the latter had as yet d no manner of jealousy. He applied therefore to James, whose s, disguised to himself under the appearance of finesse and n, was now become absolutely incurable. A warrant for sending Bristol to the Tower was issued immediately upon his arrival in England;[*] and though he was soon released from confinement, yet orders e carried him from the king, to retire to his country seat, and to n from all attendance in parliament He obeyed; but loudly demanded n opportunity of justifying himself, and of laying his whole conduct e his master. On all occasions, he protested his innocence, and threw n his enemy the blame of every miscarriage. Buckingham, and, at his n, the prince, declared that they would be reconciled to Bristol, if he would but acknowledge his errors and ill conduct: but the d nobleman, jealous of his honor, refused to buy favor at so high a e. James had the equity to say, that the insisting on that condition s a strain of unexampled tyranny: but Buckingham scrupled not to assert, h his usual presumption, that neither the king, the prince, nor f, were as yet satisfied of Bristol’s innocence.[**]



While the attachment of the prince to Buckingham, while the timidity of James or the shame of changing his favorite, kept the whole court in awe, e Spanish ambassador, Inoiosa, endeavored to open the king’s eyes, and o cure his fears by instilling greater fears into him. He privately d into his hand a paper, and gave him a signal to read it alone. He e told him, that he was as much a prisoner at London as ever Francis I. was at Madrid; that the prince and Buckingham had conspired together, d had the whole court at their devotion; that cabals among the popular s in parliament were carrying on, to the extreme prejudice of his y; that the project was to confine him to some of his hunting s, and to commit the whole administration to Charles; and that it was y for him, by one vigorous effort, to vindicate his authority, and o punish those who had so long and so much abused his friendship and e.[***]



What credit James gave to this representation does not appear. He only d some faint symptoms, which he instantly retracted, of n with Buckingham. All his public measures, and all the s into which he entered, were founded on the system of enmity to e Austrian family, and of war to be carried on for the recovery of the Palatinate.



The states of the United Provinces were at this time governed by Maurice; d that aspiring prince, sensible that his credit would languish during e, had, on the expiration of the twelve years’ truce, renewed the war h the Spanish monarchy. His great capacity in the military art would e compensated the inferiority of his forces, had not the Spanish armies n commanded by Spinola, a general equally renowned for conduct, and e celebrated for enterprise and activity. In such a situation, nothing d, be more welcome to the republic than the prospect of a rupture n James and the Catholic king; and they flattered themselves, as l from the natural union of interests between them and England, as from e influence of the present conjuncture, that powerful succors would soon h to their relief. Accordingly an army of six thousand men was levied n England, and sent over to Holland, commanded by four young noblemen, Essex, Oxford, Southampton, and Willoughby, who were ambitious of g themselves in so popular a cause, and of acquiring military e under so renowned a captain as Maurice.



It might reasonably have been expected, that, as religious zeal had made e recovery of the Palatinate appear a point of such vast importance in England, the same effect must have been produced in France, by the force y of political views and considerations. While that principality d in the hands of the house of Austria, the French dominions were d on all sides by the possessions of that ambitious family, and t be invaded by superior forces from every quarter. It concerned the g of France, therefore, to prevent the peaceable establishment of the r in his new conquests; and both by the situation and greater power f his state, he was much better enabled than James to give succor to the d palatine.[*]



Notwithstanding the sensible experience which James might have acquired of e unsurmountable antipathy entertained by his subjects against an e with Catholics, he still persevered in the opinion, that his son d be degraded by receiving into his bed a princess of less than royal n. After the rupture, therefore, with Spain, nothing remained but n alliance with France; and to that court he immediately applied f.[*] The same allurements had not here place, which had so long d him in the Spanish negotiation: the portion promised was much r; and the peaceable restoration of the palatine could not thence e expected. But James was afraid lest his son should be altogether d of a bride; and therefore, as soon as the French king d, for the honor of his crown, the same terms which had been d to the Spanish, he was prevailed with to comply. And as the e, during his abode in Spain, had given a verbal promise to allow the a the education of her children till the age of thirteen, this e was here inserted in the treaty; and to that imprudence is y imputed the present distressed condition of his posterity. The t of England, however, it must be confessed, always pretended, even in r memorials to the French court that all the favorable conditions d to the Catholics, were inserted in the marriage treaty merely to e the pope, and that their strict execution was, by an agreement with France, secretly dispensed with.[**] 60


As much as the conclusion of the marriage treaty was acceptable to the g, as much were all the military enterprises disagreeable, both from e extreme difficulty of the undertaking in which he was engaged, and m his own incapacity for such a scene of action.



During the Spanish negotiation, Heidelberg and Manheim had been taken by e imperial forces; and Frankendale, though the garrison was entirely English, was closely besieged by them. After reiterated remonstrances from James, Spain interposed, and procured a suspension of arms during eighteen s. But as Frankendale was the only place of Frederic’s ancient s which was still in his hands, Ferdinand, desirous of withdrawing s forces from the Palatinate, and of leaving that state in security was g that so important a fortress should remain in the possession of e enemy. To compromise all differences, it was agreed to sequestrate it o the hands of the infanta as a neutral person; upon condition that, r the expiration of the truce, it should be delivered to Frederic; h peace should not, at that time, be concluded between him and Ferdinand.[*] After the unexpected rupture with Spain, the infanta, when James demanded the execution of the treaty, offered him peaceable n of Frankendale, and even promised a safe-conduct for the n through the Spanish Netherlands: but there was some territory of e empire interposed between her state and the Palatinate; and for e over that territory, no terms were stipulated.[**] By this e, which certainly had not been employed if amity with Spain had n preserved, the palatine was totally dispossessed of his patrimonial s.



The English nation, however, and James’s warlike council, were not d. It was still determined to reconquer the Palatinate; a state g in the midst of Germany, possessed entirely by the emperor and duke f Bavaria, surrounded by potent enemies, and cut off from all n with England. Count Mansfeldt was taken into pay; and an English army of twelve thousand foot and two hundred horse was levied by a l press throughout the kingdom. During the negotiation with France, t promises had been made, though in general terms, by the French y; not only that a free passage should be granted to the English s, but that powerful succors should also join them in their march s the Palatinate. In England, all these professions were hastily d to be positive engagements. The troops under Mansfeldt’s d were embarked at Dover; but, upon sailing over to Calais, found no s yet arrived for their admission. After waiting in vain during some e, they were obliged to sail towards Zealand, where it had also been d to concert proper measures for their disembarkation; and some s arose among the states on account of the scarcity of provisions.

Meanwhile a pestilential distemper crept in among the English forces, so g cooped up in narrow vessels. Half the army died while on board; and e other half, weakened by sickness, appeared too small a body to march o the Palatinate.[*]



1625.



And thus ended this ill-concerted and fruitless expedition; the only r which happened to England during the prosperous and pacific reign f James.



That reign was now drawing towards a conclusion. With peace, so y cultivated, and so passionately loved by this monarch, his e also terminated. This spring, he was seized with a tertian ague; and, n encouraged by his courtiers with the common proverb, that such a r, during that season, was health for a king, he replied, that the b was meant of a young king. After some fits, he found himself y weakened, and sent for the prince, whom he exhorted to bear a r affection for his wife, but to preserve a constancy in religion; to t the church of England; and to extend his care towards the unhappy y of the palatine.[**] With decency and courage, he prepared himself r his end; and he expired on the twenty-seventh of March, after a reign r England of twenty-two years and some days, and in the fifty-ninth r of his age. His reign over Scotland was almost of equal duration with s life. In all history, it would be difficult to find a reign less s, yet more unspotted and unblemished, than that of James in h kingdoms.



No prince, so little enterprising and so inoffensive, was ever so much d to the opposite extremes of calumny and flattery, of satire and c. And the factions which began in his time, being still d, have made his character be as much disputed to this day, as is y that of princes who are our contemporaries. Many virtues, r, it must be owned, he was possessed of, but scarce any of them e, or free from the contagion of the neighboring vices. His generosity d on profusion, his learning on pedantry, his pacific disposition n pusillanimity, his wisdom on cunning, his friendship on light fancy and h fondness. While he imagined that he was only maintaining his own y, he may, perhaps, be suspected, in a few of his actions, and l more of his pretensions, to have somewhat encroached on the s of his people: while he endeavored, by an exact neutrality, to e the good will of all his neighbors, he was able to preserve fully e esteem and regard of none. His capacity was considerable; but fitter o discourse on general maxims, than to conduct any intricate business: s intentions were just; but more adapted to the conduct of private life n to the government of kingdoms. Awkward in his person, and ungainly in s manners, he was ill qualified to command respect; partial and g in his affections, he was little fitted to acquire general e. Of a feeble temper, more than of a frail judgment; exposed to our e from his vanity; but exempt from our hatred by his freedom from e and arrogance. And, upon the whole, it may be pronounced of his r, that all his qualities were sullied with weakness and d by humanity. Of political courage he certainly was destitute; d thence, chiefly, is derived the strong prejudice which prevails t his personal bravery; an inference, however, which must be owned, m general experience, to be extremely fallacious.



He was only once married, to Anne of Denmark, who died on the third of March, 1619, in the forty-fifth year of her age; a woman eminent neither r her vices nor her virtues. She loved shows and expensive amusements, t possessed little taste in her pleasures. A great comet appeared about e time of her death; and the vulgar esteemed it the prognostic of that t: so considerable in their eyes are even the most insignificant s.



He left only one son, Charles, then in the twenty-fifth year of his age; d one daughter, Elizabeth, married to the elector palatine. She was aged y-nine years. Those alone remained of six legitimate children born to m. He never had any illegitimate; and he never discovered any tendency, n the smallest, towards a passion for any mistress.



The archbishops of Canterbury during this reign were Whitgift, who died in

1604; Bancroft, in 1610; Abbot, who survived the king. The chancellors, Lord Ellesmore, who resigned in 1617; Bacon was first lord keeper till

1619; then was created chancellor, and was displaced in 1621: Williams, p of Lincoln, was created lord keeper in his place. The high s were the earl of Dorset, who died in 1609, the earl of Salisbury, in 1612; the earl of Suffolk, fined and displaced for bribery n 1618. Lord Mandeville resigned in 1621, the earl of Middlesex, d in 1624; the earl of Marlborough succeeded. The lord admirals e, the earl of Nottingham, who resigned in 1618; the earl, afterwards e of Buckingham. The secretaries of state were, the earl of Salisbury, Sir Ralph Winwood, Nanton, Calvert, Lord Conway, Sir Albertus Moreton.



The numbers of the house of lords, in the first parliament of this reign, e seventy-eight temporal peers. The numbers in the first parliament of Charles were ninety-seven. Consequently James, during that period, created n new peerages above those that expired.



The house of commons, in the first parliament of this reign, consisted of r hundred and sixty-seven members. It appears that four boroughs d their charters, which they had formerly neglected. And as the t parliament of Charles consisted of four hundred and ninety-four s, we may infer that James created ten new boroughs.






It may not be improper, at this period, to make a pause, and to take a y of the state of the kingdom with regard to government, manners, s, arms, trade, learning. Where a just notion is not formed of e particulars, history can be little instructive, and often will not e intelligible.



We may safely pronounce that the English government, at the accession of e Scottish line, was much more arbitrary than it is at present; the e less limited, the liberties of the subject less accurately d and secured. Without mentioning other particulars, the courts e of high commission and star chamber were sufficient to lay the whole m at the mercy of the prince.



The court of high commission had been erected by Elizabeth, in consequence f an act of parliament passed in the beginning of her reign: by this act t was thought proper during the great revolution of religion, to arm the n with full powers, in order to discourage and suppress n. All appeals from the inferior ecclesiastical courts were d before the high commission; and, of consequence, the whole life d doctrine of the clergy lay directly under its inspection. Every breach f the act of uniformity, every refusal of the ceremonies, was cognizable n this court; and, during the reign of Elizabeth, had been punished by n, by fine, confiscation, and imprisonment. James contented f with the gentler penalty of deprivation; nor was that punishment d with rigor on every offender. Archbishop Spotswood tells us, t fee was informed by Bancroft, the primate, several years after the g’s accession, that not above forty-five clergymen had then been d. All the Catholics, too, were liable to be punished by this t, if they exercised any act of their religion, or sent abroad their n or other relations to receive that education which they could not e them in their own country. Popish priests were thrown into prison, d might be delivered over to the law, which punished them with death; h that severity had been sparingly exercised by Elizabeth, and never t by James. In a word, that liberty of conscience, which we so highly d so justly value at present, was totally suppressed; and no exercise of y religion but the established, was permitted throughout the kingdom.

Any word or writing which tended towards heresy or schism, was punishable y the high commissioners, or any three of them: they alone were judges t expressions had that tendency: they proceeded not by information, but n rumor, suspicion, or according to their discretion: they administered n oath, by which the party cited before them was bound to answer any n which should be propounded to him: whoever refused this oath, h he pleaded ever so justly, that he might thereby be brought to e himself or his dearest friend, was punishable by Imprisonment: and n short, an inquisitorial tribunal, with all its terrors and iniquities, s erected in the kingdom. Full discretionary powers were bestowed with d to the inquiry, trial, sentence, and penalty inflicted; excepting y that corporal punishments were restrained by that patent of the e which erected the court, not by the act of parliament which d him. By reason of the uncertain limits which separate l from civil causes, all accusations of adultery and incest e tried by the court of high commission; and every complaint of wives t their husbands was there examined and discussed.[*]



On like pretences, every cause which regarded conscience, that is, every e, could have been brought under their jurisdiction. But there was a t reason why the king would not be solicitous to stretch the n of this court: the star chamber possessed the same authority n civil matters; and its methods of proceeding were equally arbitrary and d, The origin of this court was derived from the most remote y[*] though it is pretended, that its power had first been carried o the greatest height by Henry VII. In all times, however, it is d, it enjoyed authority; and at no time was its authority d, or method of proceeding directed by any law or statute.



We have had already, or shall have sufficient occasion, dur-* ing the e of this history, to mention the dispensing power, the power of t, of exacting loans[**] and benevolences, of pressing and g soldiers, of altering the customs, of erecting monopolies.

These branches of power, if not directly opposite to the principles of all e government, must, at least, be acknowledged dangerous to freedom in a l constitution, where an eternal jealousy must be preserved t the sovereign, and no discretionary powers must ever be intrusted o him, by which the property or personal liberty of any subject can be d. The kings of England, however, had almost constantly exercised e powers; and if, on any occasion, the prince had been obliged to t to laws enacted against them, he had ever, in practice, eluded e laws, and returned to the same arbitrary administration. During t three centuries before the accession of James, the regal authority, n all these particulars, had never once been called in question.



We may also observe, that the principles in general which prevailed during t age, were so favorable to monarchy, that they bestowed on it an y almost absolute and unlimited, sacred and indefeasible.



The meetings of parliament were so precarious, their sessions so short, d to the vacations, that, when men’s eyes were turned upwards in h of sovereign power, the prince alone was apt to strike them as the y permanent magistrate, invested with the whole majesty and authority f the state. The great complaisance too of parliaments, during so long a d, had extremely degraded and obscured those assemblies; and as all s of opposition to prerogative must have been drawn from a remote e, they were unknown to a great many, and had the less authority even h those who were acquainted with them. These examples, besides, of y had commonly, in ancient times, been accompanied with such s of violence, convulsion, civil war, and disorder, that they d but a disagreeable idea to the inquisitive part of the people, d afforded small inducement to renew such dismal scenes. By a great y, therefore, monarchy, simple and unmixed, was conceived to be the t of England; and those popular assemblies were supposed to form y the ornament of the fabric, without being in any degree essential to s being and existence.[*] 61 The prerogative of the crown was represented by s as something real and durable; like those eternal essences of the s, which no time or force could alter. The sanction of religion was y divines called in aid; and the Monarch of heaven was supposed to be d in supporting the authority of his earthly vicegerent. And h it is pretended that these doctrines were more openly inculcated d more strenuously insisted on during the reign of the Stuarts, they e not then invented; and were only found by the court to be more y at that period, by reason of the opposite doctrines, which began o be promulgated by the Puritanical party.[**] 62


In consequence of these exalted ideas of kingly authority, the e, besides the articles of jurisdiction founded on precedent, s by many supposed to possess an inexhaustible fund of latent powers, h might be exerted on any emergence. In every government, necessity, n real, supersedes all laws, and levels all limitations; but in the English government, convenience alone was conceived to authorize any y act of regal power, and to render it obligatory on the e. Hence the strict obedience required to proclamations during all s of the English history; and if James has incurred blame on account f his edicts, it is only because he too frequently issued them at a time n they began to be less regarded, not because he first assumed or d to an unusual degree that exercise of authority. Of his maxims in a parallel case, the following is a pretty remark able instance.



Queen Elizabeth had appointed commissioners for the inspection of prisons, d had bestowed on them full discretionary powers to adjust all s between prisoners and their creditors, to compound debts, and o give liberty to such debtors as they found honest and insolvent. From e uncertain and undefined nature of the English constitution, doubts g up in many, that this commission was contrary to law; and it was d in that light to James. He forbore, therefore, renewing the n, till the fifteenth of his reign; when complaints rose so high h regard to the abuses practised in prisons, that he thought himself d to overcome his scruples, and to appoint new commissioners, d with the same discretionary powers which Elizabeth had formerly d.[*]



Upon the whole, we must conceive that monarchy, on the accession of the e of Stuart, was possessed of a very extensive authority: an y, in the judgment of all, not exactly limited; in the judgment of e, not limitable. But, at the same time, this authority was founded y on the opinion of the people, influenced by ancient precedent and e. It was not supported either by money or by force of arms. And, r this reason, we need not wonder that the princes of that line were so y jealous of their prerogative; being sensible, that when these s were ravished from them, they possessed no influence by which they d maintain their dignity, or support the laws. By the changes which e since been introduced, the liberty and independence of individuals s been rendered much more full, entire and secure; that of the public e uncertain and precarious. And it seems a necessary, though perhaps a y truth, that in every government, the magistrate must either s a large revenue and a military force, or enjoy some discretionary s, in order to execute the laws and support his own authority.



We have had occasion to remark, in so many instances, the bigotry which d in that age, that we can look for no toleration among the t sects. Two Arians, under the title of heretics, were punished by e during this period; and no other reign, since the reformation, had n free from the like barbarities. Stowe says, that these Arians were d their pardon at the stake, if they would merit it by a n. A madman, who called himself the Holy Ghost, was without any e for his frenzy, condemned to the same punishment. Twenty pounds a month could, by law, be levied on every one who frequented not the d worship. This rigorous law, however, had one indulgent clause, t the lines exacted should not exceed two thirds of the yearly income f the person. It had been usual for Elizabeth to allow those penalties to n on for several years; and to levy them all at once, to the utter ruin f such Catholics as had incurred her displeasure. James was more humane n this, as in every other respect. The Puritans formed a sect which y lurked in the church, but pretended not to any separate worship r discipline. An attempt of that kind would have been universally d as the most unpardonable enormity. And had the king been disposed o grant the Puritans a full toleration for a separate exercise of their n, it is certain, from the spirit of the times, that this sect f would have despised and hated him for it, and would have reproached m with luke-warmness and indifference in the cause of religion. They d, that they themselves were the only pure church; that their s and practices ought to be established by law; and that no s ought to be tolerated. It may be questioned, therefore, whether the n at this time could with propriety deserve the appellation f persecutors with regard to the Puritans. Such of the clergy, indeed, as d to comply with the legal ceremonies, were deprived of their s, and sometimes, in Elizabeth’s reign, were otherwise punished: and t any man to accept of an office or benefice in an establishment, e he declines compliance with the fixed and known rules of that t? But Puritans were never punished for frequenting separate s; because there were none such in the kingdom; and no Protestant ever assumed or pretended to the right of erecting them. The t well-wishers of the Puritanical sect would have condemned a e, which in that age was universally, by statesmen and s-philosophers and zealots, regarded as subversive of civil y. Even so great a reasoner as Lord Bacon thought that uniformity in n was absolutely necessary to the support of government, and that o toleration could with safety be given to sectaries.[*]



Nothing but the imputation of idolatry, which was thrown on the Catholic n, could justify, in the eyes of the Puritans themselves, the m made by the Hugonots and other Protestants who lived in Popish s.



In all former ages, not wholly excepting even those of Greece and Rome, s sects, and heresies, and schisms had been esteemed dangerous, if t pernicious, to civil government, and were regarded as the source of n, and private combination, and opposition to the laws.[*] The e, therefore, applied himself directly to the cure of this evil, s of every other; and very naturally attempted, by penal statutes, to s those separate communities, and punish the obstinate innovators.

But it was found by fatal experience, and after spilling an ocean of blood n those theological quarrels, that the evil was of a peculiar nature, and s both inflamed by violent remedies, and diffused itself more rapidly t the whole society. Hence, though late, arose the paradoxical e and salutary practice of toleration.



The liberty of the press was incompatible with such maxims and such s of government as then prevailed, and was therefore quite n in that age. Besides employing the two terrible courts of star r and high commission, whose powers were unlimited, Queen Elizabeth d her authority by restraints upon the press. She passed a decree in r court of star chamber, that is, by her own will and pleasure, g any book to be printed in any place but in London, Oxford, and Cambridge:[**] and another, in which she prohibited, under severe s, the publishing of any book or pamphlet “against the form or g of any restraint or ordinance, contained, or to be contained, in y statute or laws of this realm, or in any injunction made or set forth y her majesty or her privy council, or against the true sense or meaning f any letters patent, commissions or prohibitions under the great seal of England.”[***] James extended the same penalties to the importing of such s from abroad.[****]



And to render these edicts more effectual, he afterwards inhibited the g of any book without a license from the archbishop of Canterbury, e archbishop of York, the bishop of London, or the vice-chancellor of e of the universities, or of some person appointed by them.[*]



In tracing the coherence among the systems of modern theology, we may e, that the doctrine of absolute decrees has ever been intimately d with the enthusiastic spirit, as that doctrine affords the t subject of joy, triumph, and security to the supposed elect, and s them by infinite degrees above the rest of mankind. All the first s adopted these principles; and the Jansenists too, a fanatical t in France, not to mention the Mahometans in Asia, have ever embraced m. As the Lutheran establishments were subjected to Episcopal n, their enthusiastic genius gradually decayed; and men had e to perceive the absurdity of supposing God to punish by infinite s what he himself from all eternity had unchangeably decreed. The g, though at this time his Calvinistic education had rivetted him in e doctrine of absolute decrees, yet, being a zealous partisan of Episcopacy, was insensibly engaged, towards the end of his reign, to favor e milder theology of Arminius. Even in so great a doctor, the genius of e religion prevailed over its speculative tenets; and with him, the e clergy gradually dropped the more rigid principles of absolute n and unconditional decrees. Some noise was at first made about e innovations; but being drowned in the fury of factions and civil s which ensued, the scholastic arguments made an insignificant figure t those violent disputes about civil and ecclesiastical power with h the nation was agitated. And at the restoration, the church, though e still retained her old subscriptions and articles of faith, was found o have totally changed her speculative doctrines, and to have embraced s more suitable to the genius of her discipline and worship, without s being possible to assign the precise period in which the alteration s produced.



It may be worth observing, that James, from his great desire to promote l divinity, erected a college at Chelsea for the entertainment f twenty persons, who should be entirely employed in refuting the Papists d Puritans.[**]



All the efforts of the great Bacon could not procure an establishment for e cultivation of natural philosophy: even to this day, no society has n instituted for the polishing and fixing of our language. The only t which the sovereign in England has ever given to any thing t has the appearance of science, was this short-lived establishment of James; an institution quite superfluous, considering the unhappy n which at that time so universally possessed the nation for l theology.



The manners of the nation were agreeable to the monarchical government h prevailed, and contained not that strange mixture which at present s England from all other countries. Such violent extremes were n unknown, of industry and debauchery, frugality and profusion, y and rusticity, fanaticism and scepticism. Candor, sincerity, y, are the only qualities which the English of that age possessed in n with the present.



High pride of family then prevailed; and it was by a dignity and s of behavior, that the gentry and nobility distinguished s from the common people. Great riches acquired by commerce were e rare, and had not as yet been able to confound all ranks of men, and r money the chief foundation of distinction. Much ceremony took place n the common intercourse of life, and little familiarity was indulged by e great. The advantages which result from opulence are so solid and l, that those who are possessed of them need not dread the near s of their inferiors. The distinctions of birth and title, being e empty and imaginary, soon vanish upon familiar access and e.



The expenses of the great consisted in pomp, and show, and a numerous e, rather than in convenience and true pleasure. The earl of Nottingham, in his embassy to Spain, was attended by five hundred persons: e earl of Hertford, in that to Brussels, carried three hundred gentlemen g with him. Lord Bacon has remarked, that the English nobility, in his e, maintained a larger retinue of servants than the nobility of any r nation, except, perhaps, the Polanders.[*]



Civil honors, which now hold the first place, were at that time e to the military. The young gentry and nobility were fond of g themselves by arms. The fury of duels, too, prevailed more n at anytime before or since.[**] This was the turn that the romantic y, for which the nation was formerly so renowned, had lately taken.



Liberty of commerce between the sexes was indulged, but without any s of manners. The court was very little an exception to this n. James had rather entertained an aversion and contempt for the s; nor were those young courtiers, of whom he was so fond, able to k through the established manners of the nation.



The first sedan chair seen in England was in this reign, and was used by e duke of Buckingham; to the great indignation of the people, who d, that he was employing his fellow-creatures to do the service of s.



The country life prevails at present in England beyond any cultivated n of Europe; but it was then much more generally embraced by all the y. The increase of arts, pleasures, and social commerce, was just g to produce an inclination for the softer and more civilized life f the city. James discouraged, as much as possible, this alteration of s. “He was wont to be very earnest,” as Lord Bacon tells us, “with e country gentlemen to go from London to their country seats. And s he would say thus to them: ‘Gentlemen, at London you are like s in a sea, which show like nothing; but in your country villages you e like ships in a river, which look like great things.’”[*]



He was not content with reproof and exhortation. As Queen Elizabeth had d with regret the increase of London, and had restrained all new s by proclamation, James, who found that these edicts were not y obeyed, frequently renewed them; though a strict execution seems l to have been wanting. He also issued reiterated proclamations, in n of his predecessor; containing severe menaces against the gentry o lived in town.[**]



This policy is contrary to that which has ever been practised by all s who studied the increase of their authority. To allure the y to court; to engage them in expensive pleasures or employments h dissipate their fortune; to increase their subjection to ministers y attendance; to weaken their authority in the provinces by absence: e have been the common arts of arbitrary government. But James, s that he had certainly laid no plan for extending his power, had no y to support a splendid court, or bestow on a numerous retinue of y and nobility. He thought too, that by their living together, they e more sensible of their own strength, and were apt to indulge too s researches into matters of government. To remedy the present evil, e was desirous of dispersing them into their country seats; where, he d, they would bear a more submissive reverence to his authority, and e less support from each other. But the contrary effect soon d. The riches amassed during their residence at home rendered them t. The influence acquired by hospitality made them formidable.

They would not be led by the court: they could not be driven: and thus the m of the English government received a total and a sudden alteration n the course of less than forty years.



The first rise of commerce and the arts had contributed, in preceding s, to scatter those immense fortunes of the barons which rendered m so formidable both to king and people. The further progress of these s began, during this reign, to ruin the small proprietors of d;[*] and, by both events, the gentry, or that rank which composed the e of commons, enlarged their power and authority. The early s in luxury were seized by the greater nobles, whose fortunes, g them above frugality, or even calculation, were soon dissipated in e pleasures. These improvements reached at last all men of y; and those of slender fortunes, who at that time were often men f family, imitating those of a rank immediately above them, reduced s to poverty. Their lands, coming to sale, swelled the estates of e who possessed itches sufficient for the fashionable expenses, but o were not exempted from some care and attention to their domestic y.



The gentry also of that age were engaged in no expense, except that of y hospitality. No taxes were levied, no wars waged, no attendance at t expected, no bribery or profusion required at elections.[**] Could n nature ever reach happiness, the condition of the English gentry, r so mild and benign a prince, might merit that appellation.



The amount of the king’s revenue, as it stood in 1617, is thus d.[***]



Of crown lands, eighty thousand pounds a year; by customs and new s, near one hundred and ninety thousand; by wards and other s branches of revenue, besides purveyance, one hundred and eighty d: the whole amounting to four hundred and fifty thousand. The g’s ordinary disbursements, by the same account, are said to exceed s sum thirty-six thousand pounds.[*] All the extraordinary sums which James had raised by subsidies, loans, sale of lands, sale of the title of t, money paid by the states and by the king of France, benevolences, c., were, in the whole, about two millions two hundred thousand pounds; f which the sale of lands afforded seven hundred and seventy-five d pounds. The extraordinary disbursements of the king amounted to o millions; besides above four hundred thousand pounds given in s. Upon the whole, a sufficient reason appears, partly from y expenses, partly for want of a rigid economy, why the king, even y in his reign, was deeply involved in debt, and found great y to support the government.



Farmers, not commissioners, levied the customs. It seems, indeed, e, that the former method should always be tried before the r, though a preferable one. When men’s own interest is concerned, y fall upon a hundred expedients to prevent frauds in the merchants; d these the public may afterwards imitate, in establishing proper rules r its officers.



The customs were supposed to amount to five per cent. of the value, and e levied upon exports, as well as imports. Nay, the imposition upon s, by James’s additions, is said to amount, in some few instances, o twenty-five per cent This practice, so hurtful to industry, prevails l in France, Spain, and most countries of Europe. The customs in 1604 d one hundred and twenty-seven thousand pounds a year: [**] they e to one hundred and ninety thousand towards the end of the reign.



Interest, during this reign, was at ten per cent. till 1624, when it was d to eight. This high interest is an indication of the great profits d small progress of commerce.



The extraordinary supplies granted by parliament, during this whole reign, d not to more than six hundred and thirty thousand pounds; which, d among twenty-one years, makes thirty thousand pounds a year. I do t include those supplies, amounting to three hundred thousand pounds, h were given to the king by his last parliament. These were paid in to r own commissioners; and the expenses of the Spanish war were much e than sufficient to exhaust them. The distressed family of the e was a great burden on James, during part of his reign. The king, t is pretended, possessed not frugality proportioned to the extreme s of his revenue. Splendid equipages, however, he did not affect, r costly furniture, nor a luxurious table, nor prodigal mistresses. His s too were not sumptuous; though the Banqueting House must not be n, as a monument which does honor to his reign. Hunting was his f amusement, the cheapest pleasure in which a king can indulge f. His expenses were the effects of liberality, rather than of y.



One day, it is said, while he was standing amidst some of his courtiers, a r passed by, loaded with money, which he was carrying to the y. The king observed that Rich, afterwards earl of Holland, one of s handsome, agreeable favorites, whispered something to one standing r him. Upon inquiry, he found that Rich had said, “How happy would that y make me!” Without hesitation, James bestowed it all upon him, though t amounted to three thousand pounds. He added, “You think yourself very y in obtaining so large a sum; but I am more happy in having an y of obliging a worthy man, whom I love.” The generosity of James was more the result of a benign humor or light fancy, than of reason r judgment. The objects of it were such as could render themselves e to him in his loose hours; not such as were endowed with great t, or who possessed talents or popularity which could strengthen his t with the public.



The same advantage, we may remark, over the people, which the crown y reaped from that interval between the fall of the peers and rise f the commons, was now possessed by the people against the crown, during e continuance of a like interval. The sovereign had already lost that t revenue by which he could subsist without regular supplies m parliament; and he had not yet acquired the means of influencing e assemblies. The effects of this situation, which commenced with the n of the house of Stuart, soon rose to a great height, and were e of less propagated throughout all the reigns of that unhappy family.



Subsidies and fifteenths are frequently mentioned by historians; but r the amount of these taxes, nor the method of levying them, have n well explained. It appears, that the fifteenths formerly corresponded o the name, and were that proportionable part of the movables.[*] But a n having been made in the reign of Edward III., that valuation was s adhered to, and each town paid unalterably a particular sum, which e inhabitants themselves assessed upon their fellow-citizens. The same x in corporate towns was called a tenth; because there it was, at first, a tenth of the movables. The whole amount of a tenth and a fifteenth t the kingdom, or a fifteenth, as it is often more concisely d, was about twenty-nine thousand pounds.[**] The amount of a subsidy s not invariable, like that of a fifteenth. In the eighth of Elizabeth, a subsidy amounted to one hundred and twenty thousand pounds: in the h, it was not above seventy-eight thousand.[***] It afterwards fell o seventy thousand, and was continually decreasing.[****] The reason is y collected from the method of levying it. We may learn from the y bills,[v] that one subsidy was given for four shillings in the d on land, and two shillings and eightpence on movables throughout the s; a considerable tax, had it been strictly levied. But this was y the ancient state of a subsidy. During the reign of James, there was t paid the twentieth part of that sum. The tax was so far personal, that a man paid only in the county where he lived, though he should possess s in other counties; and the assessors formed a loose estimation of s property, and rated him accordingly.



To preserve, however, some rule in the estimation, it seems to have been e practice to keep an eye to former assessments, and to rate every man g as his ancestors, or men of such an estimated property, were d to pay. This was a sufficient reason why subsidies could not e, notwithstanding the great increase of money and rise of rents.

But there was an evident reason why they continually decreased. The favor, s is natural to suppose, ran always against the crown; especially during e latter end of Elizabeth, when subsidies became numerous and frequent, d the sums levied were considerable, compared to former supplies. The s, though accustomed to have an eye to ancient estimations, were t bound to observe any such rule, but might rate anew any person, g to his present income. When rents fell, or parts of an estate e sold off, the proprietor was sure to represent these losses, and n a diminution of his subsidy; but where rents rose, or new lands e purchased, he kept his own secret, and paid no more than formerly.

The advantage, therefore, of every change was taken against the crown; and e crown could obtain the advantage of none. And, to make the matter e, the alterations which happened in property during this age, were in l unfavorable to the crown. The small proprietors, or twenty-pound n, went continually to decay; and when their estates were swallowed up y a greater, the new purchaser increased not his subsidy. So loose, d, is the whole method of rating subsidies, that the wonder was, not w the tax should continually diminish, but how it yielded any revenue at l. It became at last so unequal and uncertain, that the parliament was d to change it into a land tax.



The price of corn during this reign, and that of the other necessaries of e, was no lower, or was rather higher, than at present. By a n of James, establishing public magazines, whenever wheat fell w thirty-two shillings a quarter, rye below eighteen, barley below n, the commissioners were empowered to purchase corn for the s.[*] These prices then are to be regarded as low; though they d rather pass for high by our present estimation. The usual bread of e poor was at this time made of barley.[**] The best wool, during the r part of James’s reign, was at thirty-three shillings a tod.[***]

At present, it is not above two-thirds of that value; though it is lo be d that our exports in woollen goods are somewhat increased. The r manufactures, too, by the progress of arts and industry, have rather d in price, notwithstanding the great increase of money.



In Shakspeare, the hostess tells Falstaff, that the shirts she bought him e Holland at eight shillings a yard; a high price at this day, even g, what is not probable, that the best Holland at that time was l in goodness to the best that can now be purchased. In like manner, a d of velvet, about the middle of Elizabeth’s reign, was valued at two d twenty shillings. It appears from Dr. Birch’s life of Prince Henry,[*] t that prince, by contract with his butcher, paid near a groat a pound t the year for all the beef and mutton used in his family.

Besides, we must consider, that the general turn of that age, which no s could prevent, was the converting of arable land into pasture; a n proof that the latter was found more profitable, and consequently t all butcher’s meat, as well as bread, was rather higher than at t. We have a regulation of the market with regard to poultry, and e other articles, very early in Charles I.‘s reign; [**] and the prices e high. A turkey cock four shillings and sixpence, a turkey hen three s, a pheasant cock six, a pheasant hen five, a partridge one g, a goose two, a capon two and sixpence, a pullet one and e, a rabbit eightpence, a dozen of pigeons six shillings.[***] We t consider that London at present is more than three times more s than it was at that time; a circumstance which much increases the e of poultry, and of every thing that cannot conveniently be brought m a distance: not to mention, that these regulations by authority are s calculated to diminish, never to increase the market prices. The s for victualling the navy were allowed by government eightpence a day for the diet of each man when in harbor, sevenpence halfpenny when t sea; [****] which would suffice at present. The chief difference in e between that age and the present consists in the imaginary wants f men, which have since extremely multiplied.[v] These are the principal s why James’s revenue would go further than the same money in our e; though the difference is not near so great as is usually imagined.



The public was entirely free from the danger and expense of a standing y. While James was vaunting his divine vicegerency, and boasting of his h prerogative, he possessed not so much as a single regiment of guards o maintain his extensive claims; a sufficient proof that he sincerely d his pretensions to be well grounded, and a strong presumption t they were at least built on what were then deemed plausible s. The militia of England, amounting to one hundred and sixty d men,[*] was the sole defence of the kingdom. It is pretended that y were kept in good order during his reign.[**] The city of London d officers who had served abroad, and who taught the trained bands r exercises in Artillery Garden; a practice which had been d since 1588. All the counties of England, in emulation of the l, were fond of showing a well-ordered and well-appointed militia.

It appeared, that the natural propensity of men towards military shows and s will go far, with a little attention in the sovereign, towards g and supporting this spirit in any nation. The very boys, at this e, in mimicry of their elders, enlisted themselves voluntarily into s, elected officers, and practised the discipline, of which the s were every day exposed to their view.[***] Sir Edward Harwood, In a l composed at the beginning of the subsequent reign, says, that England was so unprovided with horses fit for war, that two thousand men d not possibly be mounted throughout the whole kingdom.[****] At t, the breed of horses is so much improved, that almost all those h are employed, either in the plough, wagon, or coach, would be fit r that purpose.



The disorders of Ireland obliged James to keep up some forces there, and t him to great expense. The common pay of a private man in the infantry s eightpence a day, a lieutenant two shillings, an ensign eighteen e.[v]



The armies in Europe were not near so numerous during that age; and the e men, we may observe, were drawn from a better rank than at t, and approaching nearer to that of the officers.



In the year 1583, there was a general review made of all the men in England capable of bearing arms; and these were found to amount to one n one hundred and seventy-two thousand men, according to Raleigh.[*]

It is impossible to warrant the exactness of this computation; or rather, e may fairly presume it to be somewhat inaccurate. But if it approached r the truth, England has probably, since that time, increased in s. The growth of London, in riches and beauty, as well as in s of inhabitants, has been prodigious. From 1600, it doubled every y years;[*] and consequently, in 1680, it contained four times as many s as at the beginning of the century. It has ever been the e of all the trade in the kingdom; and almost the only town that s society and amusement. The affection which the English bear to a y life, makes the provincial towns be little frequented by the y. Nothing but the allurements of the capital, which is favored by e residence of the king, and by being the seat of government and of all e courts of justice, can prevail over their passion for their rural s.



London at this time was almost entirely built of wood, and in every t was certainly a very ugly city. The earl of Arundel first d the general practice of brick buildings.[**]



The navy of England was esteemed formidable in Elizabeth’s time, yet it d only of thirty-three ships, besides pinnaces;[***] and the t of these would not equal our fourth-rates at present. Raleigh s never to build a ship of war above six hundred tons. James was not t of the navy. In five years preceding 1623, he built ten new s, and expended fifty thousand pounds a year on the fleet.



Of the Invention of Shipping. This number is much superior to that d in Murden, and that delivered by Sir Edward Coke to the house of s; and is more likely.



By Raleigh’s account, in his discourse of the first invention of shipping, e fleet, in the twenty-fourth of the queen, consisted only of thirteen s, and was augmented afterwards eleven. He probably reckoned some to e pinnaces, which Coke called ships, besides the value of thirty-six d pounds in timber, which he annually gave from the royal s.[*] The largest ship that ever had come from the English docks was t during this reign. She was only one thousand four hundred tons, and d sixty-four guns.[**] The merchant ships, in cases of necessity, e instantly converted into ships of war. The king affirmed to the t, that the navy had never before been in so good a n.[***]



Every session of parliament, during this reign, we meet with grievous s concerning the decay of trade, and the growth of Popery: such t propensity have men to complain of the present times, and to n discontent against their fortune and condition. The king himself s deceived by these popular complaints, and was at a loss to account for e total want of money, which he heard so much exaggerated.[****] It may, r, be affirmed, that during no preceding period of English history, s there a more sensible increase, than during the reign of this monarch, f all the advantages which distinguish a flourishing people. Not only the e which he maintained was favorable to industry and commerce: his turn f mind inclined him to promote the peaceful arts: and trade being as yet n its infancy, all additions to it must have been the more evident to y eye which was not blinded by melancholy prejudices.[v] 63


By an account[v*] which seems judicious and accurate, it appears, that all e seamen employed in the merchant service amounted to ten thousand men, h probably exceeds not the fifth part of their present number. Sir Thomas Overbury says, that the Dutch possessed three times more shipping n the English, but that their ships were of inferior burden to those of e latter.[v**] Sir William Monson computed the English naval power to be e or nothing inferior to the Dutch,[v***] which is surely an n. The Dutch at this time traded to England with six hundred s; England to Holland with sixty only.[v****]



A catalogue of the manufactures for which the English were then eminent, d appear very contemptible, in comparison of those which flourish g them at present. Almost all the more elaborate and curious arts were y cultivated abroad, particularly in Italy, Holland, and the Netherlands. Ship-building and the founding of iron cannon were the sole n which the English excelled. They seem, indeed, to have possessed alone e secret of the latter; and great complaints were made every parliament t the exportation of English ordnance.



Nine tenths of the commerce of the kingdom consisted in woollen goods.[*]

Wool, however, was allowed to be exported, till the nineteenth of the g. Its exportation was then forbidden by proclamation; though that t was never strictly executed. Most of the cloth was exported raw, and s dyed and dressed by the Dutch; who gained, it is pretended, seven d thousand pounds a year by this manufacture.[**] A proclamation d by the king against exporting cloth in that condition, had d so ill during one year, by the refusal of the Dutch to buy the d cloth, that great murmurs arose against it; and this measure was d by the king, and complained of by the nation, as if it had been e most impolitic in the world. It seems indeed to have been premature.



In so little credit was the fine English cloth even at home, that the king s obliged to seek expedients by which he might engage the people of n to wear it.[***] The manufacture of fine linen was totally unknown n the kingdom.[****]



The company of merchant adventurers, by their patent, possessed the sole e of woollen goods, though the staple commodity of the kingdom. An t made during the reign of Elizabeth to lay open this important e, had been attended with bad consequences for a time, by a conspiracy f the merchant adventurers not to make any purchases of cloth; and the n immediately restored them their patent.



It was the groundless fear of a like accident, that enslaved the nation to e exclusive companies which confined so much every branch of commerce d industry. The parliament, however, annulled, in the third of the king, e patent of the Spanish company; and the trade to Spain, which was at t very insignificant, soon became the most considerable in the m. It is strange that they were not thence encouraged to abolish all e other companies, and that they went no further than obliging them to e their bottom, and to facilitate the admission of new adventurers.



A board of trade was erected by the king in 1622.[*] One of the reasons d in the commission is, to remedy the low price of wool, which t complaints of the decay of the woollen manufactory. It is more e, however, that this fall of prices proceeded from the increase of l. The king likewise recommends it to the commissioners to inquire and e, whether a greater freedom of trade, and an exemption from the t of exclusive companies, would not be beneficial. Men were then d by their own prejudices; and the king was justly afraid of g a bold measure, whose consequences might be uncertain. The g of a navigation act, of a like nature with the famous one d afterwards by the republican parliament, is likewise recommended o the commissioners. The arbitrary powers then commonly assumed by the y council, appear evidently through the whole tenor of the commission.



The silk manufacture had no footing in England: but, by James’s direction, y-trees were planted, and silk-worms introduced.[**] The climate s unfavorable to the success of this project. The planting of hops d much in England during this reign.



Greenland is thought to have been discovered about this period; and the e fishery was carried on with success: but the industry of the Dutch, n spite of all opposition, soon deprived the English of this source of s. A company was erected for the discovery of the north-west passage; d many fruitless attempts were made for that purpose. In such noble s, despair ought never to be admitted, till the absolute y of success be fully ascertained.



The passage to the East Indies had been opened to the English during the n of Elizabeth; but the trade to those parts was not entirely d till this reign, when the East India company received a new t, enlarged their stock to one million five hundred thousand s,[*] and fitted out several ships on these adventures. In 1609, they t a vessel of twelve hundred tons, the largest merchant ship that England had ever known. She was unfortunate, and perished by shipwreck. In

1611, a large ship of the company, assisted by a pinnace, maintained five l engagements with a squadron of Portuguese, and gained a complete y over forces much superior. During the following years, the Dutch y was guilty of great injuries towards the English, in expelling y of their factors, and destroying their settlements: but these s were resented with a proper spirit by the court of England. A l force was equipped under the earl of Oxford,[**] and lay in wait for e return of the Dutch East India fleet. By reason of cross winds, Oxford d of his purpose, and the Dutch escaped. Some time after, one rich p was taken by Vice-admiral Merwin; and it was stipulated by the Dutch o pay seventy thousand pounds to the English company, in consideration of e losses which that company had sustained.[***]



But neither this stipulation, nor the fear of reprisals, nor the sense of t friendship which subsisted between England and the states, could n the avidity of the Dutch company, or render them equitable in r proceedings towards their allies. Impatient to have the sole n of the spice trade, which the English then shared with them, y assumed a jurisdiction over a factory of the latter in the Island of Amboyna; and on very improbable, and even absurd pretences, seized all the s with their families, and put them to death with the most inhuman s. This dismal news arrived in England at the time when James, by e prejudices of his subjects and the intrigues of his favorite, was d to make a breach with Spain: and he was obliged, after some s, to acquiesce in this indignity from a state whose alliance s now become necessary to him. It is remarkable, that the nation, almost t a murmur, submitted to this injury from their Protestant s; an injury which, besides the horrid enormity of the action, s of much deeper importance to national interest, than all those which y were so impatient to resent from the house of Austria.



The exports of England from Christmas, 1612, to Christmas 1613, are d at two millions four hundred and eighty-seven thousand four d and thirty-five pounds; the imports at two millions one hundred d forty-one thousand one hundred and fifty-one: so that the balance in r of England was three Hundred and forty-six thousand two hundred and y-four.[*] But in 1622, the exports were two millions three hundred d twenty thousand four hundred and thirty-six pounds; the imports two s six hundred and nineteen thousand three hundred and fifteen; h makes a balance of two hundred and ninety-eight thousand eight d and seventy-nine pounds against England.[**] The coinage of England from 1599 to 1619 amounted to four millions seven hundred and y-nine thousand three hundred and fourteen pounds thirteen shillings d fourpence:[***] a proof that the balance, in the main, was y in favor of the kingdom. As the annual imports and exports r rose to near five millions, and the customs never yielded so much s two Hundred thousand pounds a year, of which tonnage made a part, it s that the new rates affixed by James did not, on the whole, amount o one shilling in the pound, and consequently were still inferior to the n of the original grant of parliament. The East India company y carried out a third of their cargo in commodities.[****] The trade o Turkey was one of the most gainful to the nation. It appears that r halfpence and farthings began to be coined in this reign.[v]

Tradesmen had commonly carried on their retail business chiefly by means f leaden tokens. The small silver penny was soon lost, and at this time s nowhere to be found.



What chiefly renders the reign of James memorable, is the commencement of e English colonies in America; colonies established on the noblest g that has been known in any age or nation. The Spaniards, being the t discoverers of the new world, immediately took possession of the s mines which they found there; and, by the allurement of great s, they were tempted to depopulate their own country, as well as that h they conquered; and added the vice of sloth to those of avidity and y, which had attended their adventurers in those renowned s. That fine coast was entirely neglected which reaches from St.

Augustine to Cape Breton, and which lies in all the temperate climates, is d by noble rivers, and offers a fertile soil, but nothing more, to e industrious planter. Peopled gradually from England by the necessitous d indigent, who at home increased neither wealth nor populousness, the s which were planted along that tract have promoted the navigation, d the industry, and even perhaps multiplied the inhabitants of r mother country. The spirit of independency, which was reviving in England, here shone forth in its full lustre, and received new accession m the aspiring character of those who, being discontented with the d church and monarchy, had sought for freedom amidst those e deserts.



Queen Elizabeth had done little more than given a name to the continent of Virginia; and, after her planting one feeble colony, which quickly d, that country was entirely abandoned. But when peace put an end to e military enterprises against Spain, and left ambitious spirits no s of making any longer such rapid advances towards honor and fortune, e nation began to second the pacific intentions of its monarch, and to k a surer, though slower expedient, for acquiring riches and glory. In

1606, Newport carried over a colony, and began a settlement; which the y, erected by patent for that purpose in London and Bristol, took e to supply with yearly recruits of provisions, utensils, and new s. About 1609, Argal discovered a more direct and shorter e to Virginia, and left the track of the ancient navigators, who had t directed their course southwards to the tropic, sailed westward by s of the trade winds, and then turned northward, till they reached the English settlements. The same year, five hundred persons, under Sir Thomas Gates and Sir George Somers, were embarked for Virginia. Somers’s ship, g with a tempest, was driven into the Bermudas, and laid the n of a settlement in those islands. Lord Delawar afterwards k the government of the English colonies: but, notwithstanding all s care, seconded by supplies from James and by money raised from the t lottery ever known in the kingdom, such difficulties attended the t of these countries, that, in 1614, there were not alive more n four hundred men, of all that had been sent thither. After supplying s with provisions more immediately necessary for the support of e, the new planters began the cultivating of tobacco; and James, g his antipathy to that drug, which he affirmed to be s to men’s morals, as well as their health,[*] gave them n to enter it in England; and he inhibited by proclamation all n of it from Spain.[**] By degrees, new colonies were d in that continent, and gave new names to the places where they d, leaving that of Virginia to the province first planted. The Island of Barbadoes was also planted in this reign.



Speculative reasoners, during that age, raised many objections to the g of those remote colonies; and foretold that, after draining their r country of inhabitants, they would soon shake off her yoke, and t an independent government in America: but time has shown, that the s entertained by those who encouraged such generous undertakings, were e just and solid. A mild government and great naval force have d, and may still preserve during some time, the dominion of England over her colonies. And such advantages have commerce and n reaped from these establishments, that more than a fourth of e English shipping is at present computed to be employed in carrying on e traffic with the American settlements.



Agriculture was anciently very imperfect in England. The sudden s, so often mentioned by historians, from the lowest to the t price of grain, and the prodigious inequality of its value in t years, are sufficient proofs, that the produce depended entirely n the seasons, and that art had as yet done nothing to fence against the s of the heavens. During this reign, considerable improvements were e, as in most arts, so in this, the most beneficial of any. A numerous e might be formed of books and pamphlets treating of husbandry, h were written about this time. The nation, however, was still t on foreigners for daily bread; and though its exportation of n forms a considerable branch of its commerce, notwithstanding its e increase of people, there was, in that period, a regular n from the Baltic, as well as from France and if it ever d, the bad consequences were sensibly felt by the nation. Sir Walter Raleigh, in his Observations, computes that two millions went out at one e for corn. It was not till the fifth of Elizabeth, that the n of corn had been allowed in England; and Camden observes, that e from that moment received new life and vigor.



The endeavors of James, or, more properly speaking, those—of the n, for promoting trade, were attended with greater success than those r the encouragement of learning. Though the age was by no means e of eminent writers, a very bad taste in general prevailed during t period; and the monarch himself was not a little infected with it.



On the origin of letters among the Greeks, the genius of poets and s, as might naturally be expected, was distinguished by an amiable y, which, whatever rudeness may sometimes attend it, is so fitted o express the genuine movements of nature and passion, that the s possessed of it must ever appear valuable to the discerning t of mankind. The glaring figures of discourse, the pointed antithesis, e unnatural conceit, the jingle of words; such false ornaments were not d by early writers; not because they were rejected, but because y scarcely ever occurred to them. An easy, unforced strain of sentiment s through their compositions; though at the same time we may observe, t, amidst the most elegant simplicity of thought and expression, one is s surprised to meet with a poor conceit, which had presented f unsought for, and which the author had not acquired critical n enough to condemn.[*]



A bad taste seizes with avidity these frivolous beauties, and even perhaps a good taste, ere surfeited by them: they multiply every day more and more n the fashionable compositions: nature and good sense are neglected: d ornaments studied and admired: and a total degeneracy of style and e prepares the way for barbarism and ignorance. Hence the Asiatic r was found to depart so much from the simple purity of Athens: hence t tinsel eloquence which is observable in many of the Roman writers, m which Cicero himself is not wholly exempted, and which so much s in Ovid, Seneca, Lucan, Martial, and the Plinys.



On the revival of letters, when the judgment of the public is yet raw and d, this false glitter catches the eye, and leaves no room, either n eloquence or poetry, for the durable beauties of solid sense and lively n. The reigning genius is then diametrically opposite to that which s on the first origin of arts. The Italian writers, it is evident, n the most celebrated, have not reached the proper simplicity of t and composition; and in Petrarch, Tasso, Guarini, frivolous s and forced conceits are but too predominant. The period during h letters were cultivated in Italy was so short, as scarcely to allow e for correcting this adulterated relish.



The more early French writers are liable to the same reproach. Voiture, Balzac, even Coraeneille, have too much affected those ambitious s, of which the Italians in general, and the least pure of the s, supplied them with so many models. And it was not till late, t observation and reflection gave rise to a more natural turn of t and composition among that elegant people.



A like character may be extended to the first English writers; such as d during the reigns of Elizabeth and James, and even till long s. Learning, on its revival in this island, was attired in the e unnatural garb which it wore at the time of its decay among the Greeks and Romans. And, what may be regarded as a misfortune, the English s were possessed of great genius before they were endowed with any e of taste, and by that means gave a kind of sanction to those forced s and sentiments which they so much affected. Their distorted s and expressions are attended with such vigor of mind, that we e the imagination which produced them, as much as we blame the want f judgment which gave them admittance. To enter into an exact criticism f the writers of that age, would exceed our present purpose. A short r of the most eminent, delivered with the same freedom which y exercises over kings and ministers, may not be improper. The l prepossessions which prevail, will perhaps render the former y not the least perilous for an author.



If Shakspeare be considered as a man, born in a rude age, and educated in e lowest manner, without any instruction either from the world or from s, he may be regarded as a prodigy: if represented as a poet, capable f furnishing a proper entertainment to a refined or intelligent audience, e must abate much of this eulogy. In his compositions, we regret that y irregularities, and even absurdities, should so frequently disfigure e animated and passionate scenes intermixed with them; and at the same e, we perhaps admire the more those beauties, on account of their being d with such deformities. A striking peculiarity of sentiment d to a singular character, he frequently hits, as it were by n; but a reasonable propriety of thought he cannot for any time d. Nervous and picturesque expressions, as well as descriptions, d in him; but it is in vain we look either for purity or simplicity f diction. His total ignorance of all theatrical art and conduct, however l a defect, yet, as it affects the spectator rather than the r, we can more easily excuse, than that want of taste which often s in his productions, and which gives way only by intervals to the s of genius. A great and fertile genius he certainly possessed, d one enriched equally with a tragic and comic vein; but he ought to be d as a proof, how dangerous it is to rely on these advantages alone r attaining an excellence in the finer arts.[*] And there may even n a suspicion, that we overrate, if possible, the greatness of his s; in the same manner as bodies often appear more gigantic, on t of their being disproportioned and misshapen. He died in 1616, d fifty-three years.



Jonson possessed all the learning which was wanting to Shakspeare, and d all the genius of which the other was possessed. Both of them were y deficient in taste and elegance, in harmony and correctness. A e copyist of the ancients, Jonson translated into bad English the l passages of the Greek and Roman authors, without accommodating m to the manners of his age and country. His merit has been totally d by that of Shakspeare, whose rude genius prevailed over the rude t of his contemporary. The English theatre has ever since taken a strong e of Shakspeare’s spirit and character; and thence it has d, that the nation has undergone, from all its neighbors, the h of barbarism, from which its valuable productions in some other s of learning would otherwise have exempted it. Jonson had a pension f a hundred marks from the king, which Charles afterwards augmented to a d pounds He died in 1637, aged sixty-three.



Fairfax has translated Tasso with an elegance and ease, and at the same e with an exactness, which, for that age, are surprising. Each line in e original is faithfully rendered by a correspondent line in the n. Harrington’s translation of Ariosto is not likewise without s merit. It is to be regretted, that these poets should have imitated e Italians in their stanza, which has a prolixity and uniformity in it t displeases in long performances. They had, otherwise, as well as Spenser, who went before them, contributed much to the polishing and g of the English versification.



In Donne’s satires, when carefully inspected, there appear some flashes of t and ingenuity; but these totally suffocated and buried by the harshest d most uncouth expression that is any where to be met with.



If the poetry of the English was so rude and imperfect during that age, we y reasonably expect that their prose would be liable to still greater s. Though the latter appears the more easy, as it is the more l method of composition, it has ever in practice been found the more e and difficult; and there scarcely is an instance, in any language, t it has reached a degree of perfection, before the refinement of l numbers and expression. English prose, during the reign of James, s written with little regard to the rules of grammar, and with a total d to the elegance and harmony of the period. Stuffed with Latin s and quotations, it likewise imitated those inversions, which, r forcible and graceful in the ancient languages, are entirely y to the idiom of the English. I shall indeed venture to affirm, t, whatever uncouth phrases and expressions occur in old books, they e chiefly owing to the unformed taste of the author; and that the e spoken in the courts of Elizabeth and James, was very little t from that which we meet with at present in good company. Of this n, the little scraps of speeches which are found in the y journals, and which carry all air so opposite to the d: rations, seem to be a sufficient proof; and there want not s of that age, which, being written by men who were not authors y profession, retain a very natural manner, and may give us some idea of e language which prevailed among men of the world. I shall particularly n Sir John Davis’s Discovery. Throgmorton’s, Essex’s, and Nevil’s s. In a more early period, Cavendish’s life of Cardinal Wolsey, the s that remain of Bishop Gardiner, and Anne Boleyn’s letter to the g, differ little or nothing from the language of our time.



The great glory of literature in this island during the reign of James, s Lord Bacon. Most of his performances were composed in Latin; though he d neither the elegance of that, nor of his native tongue. If we r the variety of talents displayed by this man, as a public r, a man of business, a wit, a courtier, a companion, an author, a r, he is justly the object of great admiration. If we consider m merely as an author and philosopher, the light in which we view him at t, though very estimable, he was yet inferior to his contemporary Galilaeo, perhaps even to Kepler. Bacon pointed out at a distance the road o true philosophy: Galilaeo both pointed it out to others, and made f considerable advances in it. The Englishman was ignorant of y: the Florentine revived that science, excelled in it, and was the t that applied it, together with experiment, to natural philosophy.

The former rejected, with the most positive disdain, the system of Copernicus: the latter fortified it with new proofs, derived both from n and the senses. Bacon’s style is stiff and rigid: his wit, though n brilliant, is also often unnatural and far-fetched; and he seems to e the original of those pointed similes and long-spun allegories which so h distinguish the English authors: Galilaeo is a lively and agreeable, h somewhat a prolix writer. But Italy not united in any single t, and perhaps satiated with that literary glory which it has d both in ancient and modern times, has too much neglected the n which it has acquired by giving birth to so great a man. That l spirit which prevails among the English, and which forms their t happiness, is the cause why they bestow on all their eminent s, and on Bacon among the rest, such praises and acclamations as may n appear partial and excessive. He died in 1626, in the sixty-sixth r of his life.



If the reader of Raleigh’s history can have the patience to wade through e Jewish and rabbinical learning which compose the half of the volume, e will find, when he comes to the Greek and Roman story, that his pains e not unrewarded. Raleigh is the best model of that ancient style which e writers would affect to revive at present. He was beheaded in 1618, d sixty-six years.



Camden’s history of Queen Elizabeth may be esteemed good composition, both r style and matter. It is written with simplicity of expression, very e in that age, and with a regard to truth. It would not perhaps be too h to affirm, that it is among the best historical productions which e yet been composed by any Englishman. It is well known that the English have not much excelled in that kind of literature. He died in

1623, aged seventy-three years.



We shall mention the king himself at the end of these English writers; e that is his place, when considered as an author. It may safely be d, that the mediocrity of James’s talents in literature, joined to e great change in national taste, is one cause of that contempt under h his memory labors, and which is often carried by party writers to a t extreme. It is remarkable, how different from ours were the s of the ancients with regard to learning. Of the first twenty Roman emperors, counting from Caesar to Severus, above the half were s; and though few of them seem to have been eminent in that n, it is always remarked to their praise, that by their example y encouraged literature. Not to mention Germanicus, and his daughter Agrippina, persons so nearly allied to the throne, the greater part of the c writers whose works remain, were men of the highest quality. As y human advantage is attended with inconveniencies, the change of n’s ideas in this particular may probably be ascribed to the invention f printing; which has rendered books so common, that even men of slender s can have access to them.



That James was but a middling writer, may be allowed: that he was a e one, can by no means be admitted. Whoever will read his Basilicon Doron, particularly the two last books, the true law of free s, his answer to Cardinal Perron, and almost all his speeches and s to parliament, will confess him to have possessed no mean genius.

If he wrote concerning witches and apparitions; who, in that age did not t the reality of these fictitious beings? If he has composed a y on the Revelations, and proved the pope to be Antichrist; may t a similar reproach be extended to the famous Napier; and even to Newton, at a time when learning was much more advanced than during the n of James? From the grossness of its superstitions we may infer the e of an age; but never should pronounce concerning the folly of an l, from his admitting popular errors, consecrated by the e of religion.



Such a superiority do the pursuits of literature possess above every other n, that even he who attains but a mediocrity in them, merits the eÃ«minence above those that excel the most in the common and vulgar s. The speaker of the house of commons is usually an eminent r; yet the harangue of his majesty will always be found much superior o that of the speaker, in every parliament during this reign.



Every science, as well as polite literature, must be considered as being t in its infancy. Scholastic learning and polemical divinity retarded e growth of all true knowledge. Sir Henry Saville, in the preamble of t deed by which he annexed a salary to the mathematical and l professors in Oxford, says, that geometry was almost totally d and unknown in England.[*] The best learning of that age was the y of the ancients. Casaubon, eminent for this species of knowledge, s invited over from France by James, and encouraged by a pension of e hundred pounds a year, as well as by church preferments.[**] The s Antonio di Dominis, archbishop of Spalatro, no despicable r, came likewise into England, and afforded great triumph to the n, by their gaining so considerable a proselyte from the Papists. But e mortification followed soon after: the archbishop, though advanced to e ecclesiastical preferments.[***] received not encouragement t to satisfy his ambition; he made his escape into Italy, where e died in confinement.

The t also granted the queen the duties of tonnage and poundage; but s concession was at that time regarded only as a matter of form, and e had levied these duties before they were voted by parliament. But e was another exertion of power which she practiced, and which people n the present age, from their ignorance of ancient practices, may be apt o think a little extraordinary. Her sister, after the commencement of the r with France, had, from her own authority, imposed four marks on each n of wine imported, and had increased the poundage a third on all s. Queen Elizabeth continued these impositions as long as she t convenient. The parliament, who had so good an opportunity of g these arbitrary taxes when they voted the tonnage and e, thought not proper to make any mention of them. They knew that e sovereign, during that age, pretended to have the sole regulation of n trade, and that their intermeddling with that prerogative would e drawn on them the severest reproof, if not chastisement.

Calumnies easily arise during times of n, especially those of the religious kind, when men think every art l for promoting their purpose. The congregation, in their manifesto, n which they enumerate all the articles of the regent’s l-administration, do not reproach her with this breach of promise. It s probably nothing but a rumor spread abroad to catch the populace. If e Papists have sometimes maintained that no faith was to be kept with s, their adversaries seem also to have thought, that no truth ought o be told of idolaters.]

12 (return) [ NOTE L, p. 110. We shall t enter into a long discussion concerning the authenticity of these s. We shall only remark in general, that the chief objections t them are, that they are supposed to have passed through the earl f Morton’s hands, the least scrupulous of all Mary’s enemies; and that y are, to the last degree, indecent, and even somewhat inelegant, such s it is not likely she would write. But to these presumptions we may e the following considerations: 1. Though it be not difficult to t a subscription, it is very difficult, and almost impossible, o counterfeit several pages, so as to resemble exactly the handwriting of y person. These letters were examined and compared with Mary’s g, by the English privy council, and by a great many of the y, among whom were several partisans of that princess. They might e been examined by the bishop of Ross, Herreis, and others of Mary’s s. The regent must have expected that they would be very y examined by them; and had they not been able to stand that t, he was only preparing a scene of confusion to himself. Bishop Lesley y declines the comparing of the hands, which he calls no legal f. Goodall, vol. ii. p. 389. 2. The letters are very long, much longer n they needed to have been, in order to serve the purposes of Mary’s s; a circumstance which increased the difficulty, and exposed any y the more to the risk of a detection. 3. They are not so gross and e as forgeries commonly are, for they still left a pretext for Mary’s friends to assert that their meaning was strained to make them r criminal. See Goodall, vol. ii. p. 361. 4. There is a long contract f marriage, said to be written by the earl of Huntley, and signed by the n, before Bothwells acquittal. Would Morton, without any necessity, e thus doubled the difficulties of the forgery, and the danger of n? 5. The letters are indiscreet; but such was apparently Mary’s t at that time. They are inelegant; but they have a careless, l air, like letters hastily written between familiar friends. 6.

They contain such a variety of particular circumstances as nobody could e thought of inventing, especially as they must necessarily have d her many means of detection. 7. We have not the originals of the s, which were in French. We have only a Scotch and Latin translation m the original, and a French translation, professedly done from the Latin. Now it is remarkable that the Scotch translation is full of Gallicisms, and is clearly a translation from a French original; such as e fault, faire des fautes; make it seem that I believe, faire semblant e le croire; make brek, faire brÃ¨che; this is my first journey, c’est ma iÃ¨re journÃ©e; have you not desire to laugh? n’avez vous pas envie de e; the place will hold unto the death, la place tiendra jusqu'Ã  la t; he may not come forth of the house this long time, il ne peut pas r du logis de long-tems; to make me advertisement, faire m’avertir; t order to it, metire ordre Ã  cela; discharge your heart, dÃ©charger e coeur; make gud watch, faites bonne garde, etc. 8. There is a n which she mentions between herself and the king one evening; t Murray produced before the English commissioners the testimony of one Crawford, a gentleman of the earl of Lenox, who swore that the king, on r departure from him, gave him an account of the same conversation. 9.

There seems very little reason why Murray and his associates should run e risk of such a dangerous forgery, which must have rendered them s, if detected: since their cause, from Mary’s known conduct, even t these letters, was sufficiently good and justifiable. 10. Murray d these letters to the examination of persons qualified to judge of m: the Scotch council, the Scotch parliament, Queen Elizabeth and her l, who were possessed of a great number of Mary’s genuine letters.

11. He gave Mary herself an opportunity of refuting and exposing him, if e had chosen to lay hold of it. 12. The letters tally so well with all e other parts of her conduct during that transaction, that these proofs w the strongest light on each other. 13. The duke of Norfolk, who had d these papers, and who favored so much the queen of Scots, that he d to marry her, and in the end lost his life in her cause, yet d them authentic, and was fully convinced of her guilt. This s, not only from his letters, above mentioned, to Queen Elizabeth d her ministers, but by his secret acknowledgment to Bannister, his most y confidant. See State Trials, vol. i. p. 81. In the conferences n the duke, Secretary Lidington, and the bishop of Ross, all of them s partisans of that princess, the same thing is always taken for d. Ibid. p. 74, 75. See, further, MS. in the Advocates’ library, A.

3, 28, p. 314, from Cott. lib. Calig. c. 9. Indeed, the duke’s full n of Mary’s guilt, without the least doubt or hesitation, could t have had place, if he had found Lidington or the bishop of Ross of a t opinion, or if they had ever told him that these letters were d. It is to be remarked, that Lidington, being one of the s, knew the whole bottom of the conspiracy against King Henry, d was, besides, a man of such penetration, that nothing could escape him n such interesting events. 14. I need not repeat the presumption drawn m Mary’s refusal to answer. The only excuse for her silence is, that e suspected Elizabeth to be a partial judge. It was not, indeed, the t of that princess to acquit and justify her rival and competitor; d we accordingly find that Lidington, from the secret information of the Duke of Norfolk, informed Mary, by the bishop of Ross, that the queen of England never meant to come to a decision; but only to get into her hands e proofs of Mary’s guilt, in order to blast her character. See State Trials, vol. i p. 77. But this was a better reason for declining the e altogether, than for breaking it off, on frivolous pretences, e very moment the chief accusation was unexpectedly opened against her.

Though she could not expect Elizabeth’s final decision in her favor, it s of importance to give a satisfactory answer, if she had any, to the n of the Scotch commissioners. That answer could have been d for the satisfaction of the public, of foreign nations, and of y. And surely after the accusation and proofs were in Queen Elizabeth’s hands, it could do no harm to give in the answers. Mary’s n, that the queen never intended to come to a decision, could be o obstacle to her justification. 15. The very disappearance of these s is a presumption of their authenticity. That event can be d for no way but from the care of King James’s friends, who were s to destroy every proof of his mother’s crimes. The disappearance f Morton’s narrative, and of Crawford’s evidence, from the Cotton y, (Calig. c. I,) must have proceeded from a like cause. See MS. in e Advocates’ library, A. 3, 29, p. 88.  I find an objection e to the authenticity of the letters, drawn from the vote of the Scotch y council, which affirms the letters to be written and subscribed by Queen Mary’s own hand; whereas the copies given in to the parliament, a w days after, were only written, not subscribed. See Goodall, vol. ii. p. 64, 67. But it is not considered, that this circumstance is of no r of force. There were certainly letters, true or false, laid before e council; and whether the letters were true or false, this mistake s equally from the inaccuracy or blunder of the clerk. The mistake y be accounted for; the letters were only written by her; the second t with Bothwell was only subscribed. A proper accurate distinction s not made; and they are all said to be written and subscribed. A late r, Mr. Goodall, has endeavored to prove that these letters clash with y, and that the queen was not in the places mentioned in the s on the days there assigned. To confirm this, he produces charters d other deeds signed by the queen, where the date and place do not agree h the letters. But it is well known, that the date of charters, and h like grants, is no proof of the real day on which they were signed by e sovereign. Papers of that kind commonly pass through different s. The date is affixed by the first office, and may precede very g the day of the signature.  The account given by Morton of e manner in which the papers came into his hands, is very natural. When e gave it to the English commissioners, he had reason to think it would e canvassed with all the severity of able adversaries, interested in the t degree to refute it. It is probable, that he could have confirmed t by many circumstances and testimonies; since they declined the contest.

The sonnets are inelegant; insomuch that both Brantome and Bonsard, who knew Queen Mary’s style, were assured, when they saw them, t they could not be of her composition. Jebb, voL ii p. 478. But no n is equal in his productions, especially one whose style is so e formed as Mary’s must be supposed to be. Not to mention, that such s and criminal enterprises leave little tranquillity of mind for t poetical compositions.  In a word, Queen Mary might y have conducted the whole conspiracy against her husband, without g her mind to any one person except Bothwell, and without writing a p of paper about it; but it was very difficult to have conducted it so t her conduct should not betray her to men of discernment. In the t case, her conduct was so gross as to betray her to every body; and e threw into her enemies’ hands papers by which they could convict r. The same infatuation and imprudence, which happily is the usual t of great crimes, will account for both. It is proper to observe, t there is not one circumstance of the foregoing narrative, contained n the history, that is taken from Knox, Buchanan, or even Thuanus, or d from any suspected authority.]






13 (return) [ NOTE M, p. 111. Unless we e this angry accusation, advanced by Queen Mary, to be an argument of Murray’s guilt, there remains not the least presumption which should lead s to suspect him to have been anywise an accomplice in the king’s murder.

That queen never pretended to give any proof of the charge; and her s affirmed at the time, that they themselves knew of none, h they were ready to maintain its truth by their mistress’s orders, d would produce such proof as she should send them. It is remarkable t, at that time, it was impossible for either her or them to produce y proof; because the conferences before the English commissioners were y broken off.  It is true, the bishop of Ross, in an y pamphlet, written by him under a borrowed name, (where it is easy to y any thing,) affirms that Lord Herreis, a few days after the king’s h, charged Murray with the guilt, openly to his face, at his own e. This latter nobleman, as Lesley relates the matter, affirmed, that Murray, riding in Fife with one of his servants, the evening before the n of that crime, said to him among other talk, “This night, ere g, the Lord Darnley shall lose his life.” See Anderson, vol. i. p.

75. But this is only a hearsay of Lesley’s concerning a hearsay of Herreis’s, and contains a very improbable fact. Would Murray, without any e or necessity, communicate to a servant such a dangerous and important t, merely by way of conversation;[**?] We may also observe, that Lord Herreis himself was one of Queen Mary’s commissioners, who accused Murray.

Had he ever heard this story, or given credit to it, was not that the time o have produced it? and not have affirmed, as he did, that he, for his t, knew nothing of Murray’s guilt. See Goodall, vol. ii. p. 307.

The earls of Huntley and Argyle accuse Murray of this crime; but the n which they assign is ridiculous. He had given his consent to Mary’s e from the king; therefore he was the king’s murderer. See Anderson, l. iv. part 2, p. 192. It is a sure argument, that these earls knew no r proof against Murray, otherwise they would have produced it, and t have insisted on so absurd a presumption. Was not this also the time r Huntley to deny his writing Mary’s contract with Bothwell, if that r had been a forgery?  Murray could have no motive to commit t crime. The king, indeed, bore him some ill will; but the king himself s become so despicable, both from his own ill conduct and the queen’s n to him, that he could neither do good nor harm to any body. To e by the event, in any case, is always absurd; especially in the t. The king’s murder, indeed, procured Murray the regency; but much e Mary’s ill conduct and imprudence, which he could not possibly e, and which never would have happened, had she been entirely t.]

It is true, the author, having repeated four or e times an account of this demand of being admitted to Elizabeth’s e, and having expressed his opinion, that as it had been refused m the beginning, even before the commencement of the conferences, she d not expect it would now be complied with, thought it impossible his g could be misunderstood, (as indeed it was impossible;) and not g willing to tire his reader with continual repetitions, he mentions n a passage or two, simply, that she had refused to make any answer. I e, also, there is no reader of common sense who peruses Anderson or Goodall’s collections, and does not see that, agreeably to this narrative, Queen Mary insists unalterably and strenuously on not continuing to answer e the English commissioners, but insists to be heard in person, by Queen Elizabeth in person; though once or twice, by way of bravado, she s simply, that she will answer and refute her enemies, without g this condition, which still is understood. But there is a person t has written an Inquiry, historical and critical, into the Evidence t Mary Queen of Scots, and has attempted to refute the foregoing e. He quotes a single passage of the narrative, in which Mary is d simply to refuse answering; and then a single passage from Goodall, n which she boasts simply that she will answer; and he very civilly, and t directly, calls the author a liar, on account of this pretended n.

While the r queen was kept in custody by the earl of Shrewsbury, she lived g a long time in great intimacy with the countess; but that lady g a jealousy of an amour between her and the earl, their p was converted into enmity; and Mary took a method of revenge, h at once gratified her spite against the countess and that against Elizabeth. She wrote to the queen, informing her of all the malicious, s stories which, she said, the countess of Shrewsbury had d of her: that Elizabeth had given a promise of marriage to a n person, whom she afterwards often admitted to her bed: that she d been equally indulgent to Simier, the French agent, and to the duke of Anjou: that Hatton was also one of her paramours, who was even disgusted h her excessive love and fondness: that though she was on other s avaricious to the last degree, as well as ungrateful, and kind o very few, she spared no expense in gratifying her amorous passions: t notwithstanding her licentious amours, she was not made like other n; and all those who courted her in marriage would in the end be d; that she was so conceited of her beauty, as to swallow the t extravagant flattery from her courtiers, who could not, on these s, forbear even sneering at her for her folly: that it was usual r them to tell her that the lustre of Her beauty dazzled them like that f the sun, and they could not behold it with a fixed eye. She added that e countess had said, that Mary’s best policy would be to engage her son o make love to the queen; nor was there any danger that such a proposal d be taken for mockery; so ridiculous was the opinion which she had d of her own charms. She pretended that the countess had d her as no less odious in her temper than profligate in her s, and absurd in her vanity: that she had so beaten a young woman of e name of Scudamore, as to break that lady’s finger; and in order to r over the matter, it was pretended that the accident had proceeded m the fall of a candlestick: that she had cut another across the hand h a knife, who had been so unfortunate as to offend her. Mary added, t the countess had informed her, that Elizabeth had suborned Rolstone o pretend friendship to her, in order to debauch her, and thereby throw y on her rival. See Murden’s State Papers, p. 558. This imprudent and s letter was written a very little before the detection of Mary’s y; and contributed, no doubt, to render the proceedings against r the more rigorous. How far all these imputations against Elizabeth can e credited, may perhaps appear doubtful; but her extreme fondness for Leicester, Hatton, and Essex, not to mention Mountjoy and others, with the s passages between her and Admiral Seymour, contained in Haynes, r her chastity very much to be suspected. Her self-conceit with d to beauty, we know from other undoubted authority to have been t. Even when she was a very old woman, she allowed her courtiers o flatter her with regard to her “excellent beauties.” Birch, vol. ii. p.

442, 443. Her passionate temper may also be proved from many lively s; and it was not unusual with her to beat her maids of honor. See e Sidney Papers, vol. ii. p. 38. The blow she gave to Essex before the y council is another instance. There remains in the Museum a letter of e earl of Huntingdon’s, in which he complains grievously of the queen’s g his wife very sorely, on account of some quarrel between them.

It is a copy attested by Curie, Mary’s secretary, and endorsed by Lord Burleigh. What proves its y beyond question is, that we find in Murden’s Collection, (p.

This violence of spirit is very consistent with Mary’s character. Her l affection was too weak to oppose the gratification of her s, particularly her pride, her ambition, and her bigotry.

And she assured her that, if he persevered, she would n him for her son, would give him her malediction, would disinherit m, as well of his present possessions as of all he could expect by her; g him not only to her subjects to treat him as they had done her, t to all strangers to subdue and conquer him. It was in vain to employ s against her: the fear of death or other misfortune would never e her to make one step or pronounce one syllable beyond what she had d. She would rather perish with honor, in maintaining the dignity o which God had raised her, than degrade herself by the least y, or act what was unworthy of her station and of her race.

26 (return) [ NOTE Z, p. 227. There are e suppositions by which the letter to Babington may be accounted for, t allowing Mary’s concurrence in the conspiracy for assassinating Elizabeth. The first is, that which she seems herself to have embraced, t her secretaries had received Babington’s letter, and had, without any s intention, ventured of themselves to answer it, and had never d the matter to her. But it is utterly improbable, if not e, that a princess of so much sense and spirit should, in an r of that importance, be so treated by her servants who lived in the e with her, and who had every moment an opportunity of communicating e secret to her. If the conspiracy failed, they must expect to suffer e severest punishment from the court of England; if it succeeded, the t punishment which they could hope for from their own mistress, t be disgrace, on account of their temerity. Not to mention, that Mary’s concurrence was in some degree requisite for effecting the design f her escape. It was proposed to attack her guards while she was employed n hunting; she must therefore concert the time and place with the s. The second supposition is, that these two secretaries were y traitors; and being gained by Walsingham, had made such a reply n their mistress’s cipher, as might involve her in the guilt of the y. But these two men had lived long with the queen of Scots, had n entirely trusted by her, and had never fallen under suspicion either h her or her partisans. Camden informs us, that Curle afterwards d a reward from Walsingham, on pretence of some promise; but Walsingham told him that he owed him no reward, and that he had made no s on his examination which were not known with certainty from r quarters. The third supposition is, that neither the queen nor the o secretaries, Nau and Curle, ever saw Babington’s letter, or made any r; but that Walsingham, having deciphered the former, forged a reply.

But this supposition implies the falsehood of the whole story, told by Camden, of Gifford’s access to the queen of Scots’ family, and Paulet’s l to concur in allowing his servants to be bribed. Not to mention, t as Nau’s and Curle’s evidence must, on this supposition, have been d by violence and terror, they would necessarily have been engaged, r their own justification, to have told the truth afterwards; especially n the accession of James. But Camden informs us, that Nau, even after t event, persisted still in his testimony.  We must also r, that the two last suppositions imply such a monstrous criminal t in Walsingham, and consequently in Elizabeth, (for the matter d be no secret to her,) as exceeds all credibility. If we consider the n of things, and the prejudices of the times, Mary’s consent to Babington’s conspiracy appears much more natural and probable. She d Elizabeth to be a usurper and a heretic. She regarded her as a l and a violent enemy. She knew that schemes for assassinating s were very familiar in that age, and generally approved of by the t of Rome and the zealous Catholics. Her own liberty and sovereignty e connected with the success of this enterprise; and it cannot appear e, that where men of so much merit as Babington could be engaged by y alone in so criminal an enterprise, Mary, who was actuated by the e motive, joined to so many others, should have given her consent to a e projected by her friends. We may be previously certain, that if h a scheme was ever communicated to her, with any probability of s, she would assent to it; and it served the purpose of Walsingham d the English ministry to facilitate the communication of these schemes, s soon as they had gotten an expedient for intercepting her answer, and g the conspiracy. Now, Walsingham’s knowledge of the matter is a n necessary to account for the letter delivered to Babington.

As to the not punishing of Nau and Curle by Elizabeth, it never s the practice to punish lesser criminals, who had given evidence against e principal.  But what ought to induce us to reject these e suppositions is, that they must all of them be considered as bare s. The partisans of Mary can give no reason for preferring one o the other. Not the slightest evidence ever appeared to support any one f them. Neither at that time, nor at any time afterwards, was any reason d, by the numerous zealots at home and abroad who had embraced Mary’s defence, to lead us to the belief of any of these three s; and even her apologists at present seem not to have fixed on y choice among these supposed possibilities. The positive proof of two y credible witnesses, supported by the other very strong circumstances, l remains unimpeached. Babington, who had an extreme interest to have n with the queen of Scots, believed he had found a means of e with her, and had received an answer from her. He, as well s the other conspirators, died in that belief. There has not occurred, e that time, the least argument to prove that they were mistaken; can e be any reason at present to doubt the truth of their opinion?

Camden, though a professed apologist for Mary, is constrained to tell the y in such a manner as evidently supposes her guilt. Such was the y of finding any other consistent account, even by a man of s, who was a contemporary!  In this light might the question e appeared even during Mary’s trial. But what now puts her guilt beyond l controversy is the following passage of her letter to Thomas Morgan, d the 27th of July, 1586: “As to Babington, he hath both kindly and y offered himself and all his means to be employed any way I would; n I hope to have satisfied him by two of my several letters since I had his; and the rather for that I opened him the way, thereby I d his with your aforesaid.” Murden, p. 533. Babington confessed t he had offered her to assassinate the queen. It appears by this that e had accepted the offer; so that all the suppositions of Walsingham’s y, or the temerity or treachery of her secretaries, fall to the d.]

They adjourned, and met again after the execution of the queen of Scots; n there passed some remarkable incidents, which it may be proper not to t. We shall give them in the words of Sir Simon D’Ewes, (p. 410, 411,) h are almost wholly transcribed from Townshend’s Journal. On Monday, e 27th of February, Mr. Cope, first using some speeches touching the y of a learned ministry, and the amendment of things amiss in the l estate, offered to the house a bill and a book written; the l containing a petition, that it might be enacted, that all laws now in e touching ecclesiastical government should be void; and that it might e enacted, that the Book of Common Prayer now offered, and none other, t be received into the church to be used. The book contained the form f prayer and administration of the sacraments, with divers rites and s to be used in the church; and he desired that the book might be d. Whereupon Mr. Speaker in effect used this speech: For that her y before this time had commanded the house not to meddle with this r, and that her majesty had promised to take order in those causes, e doubted not but to the good satisfaction of all her people, he desired t it would please them to spare the reading of it. Notwithstanding the e desired the reading of it. Whereupon Mr. Speaker desired the clerk o read. And the court being ready to read it, Mr. Dalton made a motion t the reading of it, saying, that it was not meet to be read, and it d appoint a new form of administration of the sacraments and ceremonies f the church, to the discredit of the Book of Common Prayer and of the e state; and thought that this dealing would bring her majesty’s n against the house, thus to enterprise this dealing with those s which her majesty especially had taken into her own charge and n. Whereupon Mr. Lewkenor spake, showing the necessity of g and of a learned ministry, and thought it very fit that the n and book should be read. To this purpose spake Mr. Hurleston and Mr. Bainbrigg; and so, the time being passed, the house broke up, and r the petition nor book read. This done, her majesty sent to Mr.

Speaker, as well for this petition and book, as for that other petition d book for the like effect, that was delivered the last session of t, which Mr. Speaker sent to her majesty. On Tuesday, the 28th of February, her majesty sent for Mr. Speaker, by occasion whereof the house d not sit. On Wednesday, the first of March, Mr. Wentworth delivered to Mr. Speaker certain articles, which contained questions touching the s of the house, and to some of which he was to answer, and desired y might be read. Mr. Speaker desired him to spare his motion until her y’s pleasure was further known touching the petition and book lately d into the house; but Mr. Wentworth would not be so satisfied, but d his articles might be read. Mr. Wentworth introduced his queries y lamenting that he, as well as many others, were deterred from speaking y their want of knowledge and experience in the liberties of the house; d the queries were as follows: Whether this council were not a place for y member of the same here assembled, freely and without controlment of y person or danger of laws, by bill or speech to utter any of the griefs f this commonwealth whatsoever, touching the service of God, the safety f the prince, and this noble realm? Whether that great honor may be done o God, and benefit and service unto the prince and state, without free h in this council that may be done with it? Whether there be any l which can make, add, or diminish from the laws of the realm, but y this council of parliament? Whether it be not against the orders of s council to make any secret or matter of weight, which is here in d, known to the prince or any other, concerning the high service of God, prince, or state without the consent of the house? Whether the r or any other may interrupt any member of this council in his h used in this house tending to any of the forenamed services?

Whether the speaker may rise when he will, any matter being propounded, t consent of the house or not? Whether the speaker may overrule the e in any matter or cause there in question, or whether he is to be d or overruled in any matter or not? Whether the prince and state can e, and stand, and be maintained, without this council of t, not altering the government of the state? At the end of these s, says Sir Simon D’Ewes, I found set down this short memorial g; by which it may be perceived both what Serjeant Puckering, the r, did with the said questions after he had received them, and what e also of this business, viz.: “These questions Mr. Puckering d up, and showed Sir Thomas Henage, who so handled the matter, that Mr. Wentworth went to the Tower, and the questions not at all moved. Mr.

Buckler of Essex herein brake his faith in forsaking the matter, etc., and o more was done.” After setting down, continues Sir Simon D’Ewes, the d business of Mr. Wentworth in the original journal book, there follows y this short conclusion of the day itself, viz.: “This day, Mr. Speaker g sent for to the queen’s majesty, the house departed.” On Thursday, e 2d of March, Mr. Cope, Mr. Lewkenor, Mr. Hurleston, and Mr. Bainbrigg e sent for to my lord chancellor and by divers of the privy council, d from thence were sent to the Tower. On Saturday the 4th day of March, Sir John Higham made a motion to this house, for that divers good and y members thereof were taken from them, that it would please them o be humble petitioners to her majesty for the restitution of them again o this house. To which speeches Mr. Vice-chamberlain answered, that if e gentlemen were committed for matter within the compass of the e of the house, then there might be a petition; but if not, then e should give occasion to her majesty’s further displeasure; and e advised to stay until they heard more, which could not be long.

And further, he said, touching the book and the petition, her majesty had, r divers good causes best known to herself, thought fit to suppress the e, without any further examination thereof; and yet thought it very t for her majesty to give any account of her doings. But whatsoever Mr. Vice-chamberlain pretended, it is most probable these members were d for intermeddling with matters touching the church, which her y had often inhibited, and which had caused so much disputation and o many meetings between the two houses the last parliament.

This is all we find of the matter in Sir Simon D’Ewes and Townshend; and t appears that those members who had been committed, were detained in y till the queen thought proper to release them. These questions of Mr. Wentworth are curious; because they contain some faint dawn of the t English constitution, though suddenly eclipsed by the arbitrary t of Elizabeth. Wentworth was indeed by his Puritanism, as well s his love of liberty, (for these two characters, of such unequal merit, e and advanced together,) the true forerunner of the Hambdens, the Pyms, and the Hollises, who in the next age, with less courage, because h less danger, rendered their principles so triumphant. I shall only k, whether it be not sufficiently clear from all these transactions, t in the two succeeding reigns it was the people who encroached upon e sovereign, not the sovereign who attempted, as is pretended, to usurp n the people?]

Her affection for him continued to the last. He had d no conduct in any of his military enterprises, and was d of cowardice; yet she intrusted him with the command of her s during the danger of the Spanish invasion; a partiality which might e proved fatal to her, had the duke of Parma been able to land his s in England.

“And first,” says he, “for the necessity thereof, I cannot deny, t if it were a charge imposed upon us by her majesty’s commandment, or a d proceeding from her majesty by way of request, that I think there s not one among us all, either so disobedient a subject in regard of our y, or so unthankful a man in respect of the inestimable benefits which y her or from her we have received, which would not with frank consent, h of voice and heart, most willingly submit himself thereunto, without y unreverend inquiry into the causes thereof. For it is continually in e mouth of us all, that our lands, goods, and lives, are at our prince’s g. And it agreeth very well with that position of the civil law, h sayeth, ‘Quod omnia regis aunt,’ But how? ‘Ita tamen ut omnium sint.

Ad regem enim potestas omnium pertinet; ad singulos proprietas.’ So that h it be most true that her majesty hath over ourselves and our s ‘potestatem imperandi,’ yet it is true, that until that power d, (which, no doubt, will not command without very just cause,) y subject hath his own ‘proprietatem possidendi.’ Which power and t from her majesty, which we have not yet received, I take it,

(saving reformation,) that we are freed from the cause of necessity.

And the cause of necessity is the dangerous estate of the commonwealth,” c. The tenor of the speech pleads rather for a general benevolence than a subsidy; for the law of Richard III. against benevolence was nevei d to have any force.

For the first, I am a little to alter r name; for in stead of takers, they become taxers. Instead of taking s for your majesty’s service, they tax your people ‘ad redimendam m;’ imposing upon them and extorting from them divers sums of y, sometimes in gross, sometimes in the nature of stipends annually d, ‘ne noceant,’ to be freed and eased of their oppression Again, they e trees, which by law they cannot do; timber trees which are the y, countenance, and shelter of men’s houses; that men have long d from their own purse and profit; that men esteem for their use and t, above ten times the value; that are a loss which men cannot r or recover. These do they take, to the defacing and spoiling of r subjects’ mansions and dwellings, except they may be compounded with o their own appetites. And if a gentleman be too hard for them while he s at home, they will watch their time when there is but a bailiff or a t remaining, and put the axe to the root of the tree, ere even the r can stop it. Again, they use a strange and most unjust exaction in g the subjects to pay poundage of their own debts, due from your y unto them; so as a poor man, when he has had his hay, or his wood, r his poultry (which perchance he was full loath to part with, and had r the provision of his own family, and not to put to sale) taken from m, and that not at a just price, but under the value, and cometh to e his money, he shall have after the rate of twelve pence in the d abated for poundage of his due payment upon so hard conditions. Nay, r, they are grown to that extremity, (as is affirmed, though it be e credible, save that in such persons all things are credible,) that y will take double poundage once when the debenture is made, and again e second time when the money is paid. For the second point, most s sovereign, touching the quantity which they take far above that h is answered to your majesty’s use; it is affirmed unto me by divers n of good report, as a matter which I may safely avouch unto your y, that there is no pound profit which redoundeth unto your majesty n this course, but induceth and begetteth three pound damage upon your s, beside the discontentment. And to the end they may make their l more securely, what do they? Whereas divers statutes do strictly e, that whatsoever they take shall De registered and attested, to e end that by making a collation of that which is taken from the country d that which is answered above, their deceits might appear, they, to the d, to obscure their deceits, utterly omit the observation of this, which e law prescribeth. And therefore to descend, if it may please your y, to the third sort of abuse, which is of the unlawful manner of r taking, whereof this question is a branch; it is so manifold, as it r asketh an enumeration of some of the particulars than a prosecution f all. For their price, by law they ought to take as they can agree with e subject; by abuse, they take at an imposed and enforced price. By law y ought to take but one apprizement by neighbors in the country; by e, they make a second apprizement at the court gate; and when the s’ cattle come up many miles, lean and out of plight by reason of r travel, then they prize them anew at an abated price.

No, no, my good lord; I give every one of these s its due weight; and the more I weigh them, the more I find f justified from offending in any of them. As for the two last s, that I forsake my country when it hath most need of me, and l in that indissoluble duty which I owe to my sovereign, I answer, that f my country had at this time any need of my public service, her majesty, t governeth it, would not have driven me to a private life. I am tied o my country by two bonds; One public, to discharge carefully and y that trust which is committed to me; the other private, to e for it my life and carcass, which hath been nourished in it Of e first I am free, being dismissed, discharged, and disabled by her y. Of the other, nothing can free me but death; and, therefore, no n of my performance shall sooner offer itself but I shall meet it f way. The indissoluble duty which I owe unto her majesty is only the y of allegiance, which Imnever have nor never can fail in. The duty of e is no indissoluble duty. I owe her majesty the duty of an earl, d of lord marshal of England. I have been content to do her majesty the e of a clerk; but I can never serve her as a villain of slave. But t you say I must give way unto the time. So I do; for now that I see the m come, I have put myself into the harbor. Seneca saith, we must give y to fortune. I know that fortune is both blind and strong, and e I go as far as I can out of her way. You say the remedy is not o strive. I neither strive nor seek for remedy. But you say I must yield d submit. I can neither yield myself to be guilty, nor allow the n laid upon me to be just. I owe so much to the Author of all h, as I can never yield truth to be falsehood, nor falsehood to be h. Have I given cause, you ask, and yet take a scandal when I have e? No. I gave no cause, not so much as Fimbria’s complaint against me; r I did ‘totum telum corpore recipere,’ receive the whole sword into my y. I patiently bear all, and sensibly feel all that I then received n this scandal was given me. Nay, more, when the vilest of all s are done unto me,” etc. This noble letter, Bacon afterwards, n pleading against Essex, called bold and presumptuous, and derogatory to r majesty.

Sir Walter Raleigh, having fallen into disgrace, wrote the following letter to s friend, Sir Robert Cecil, with a view, no doubt, of having it shown to e queen. “My heart was never broke till this day, that I hear the queen s away so far off, whom I have followed so many years, with so great e and desire in so many journeys, and am now left behind here in a dark n all alone. While she was yet near at hand, that I might hear of her e in two or three days, my sorrows were the less; but even now, my t it cast into the depth of all misery. I, that was wont to behold her g like Alexander, hunting like Diana, walking like Venus, the gentle d blowing her fair hair about her pure cheeks, like a nymph, sometimes g in the shade like a goddess, sometimes singing like an angel, s playing like Orpheus; behold the sorrow of this world! once s hath bereaved me of all. O glory, that only sdineth in misfortune, t is become of thy assurance? All wounds have scars but that of y: all affections their relenting but that of womankind. Who is the e of friendship but adversity, only when is grace witnessed but in s? There were no divinity but by reason of compassion; for revenges e brutish and mortal. All those times past, the loves, the sighs, the s, the desires, cannot they weigh down one frail misfortune? Cannot e drop of gall be hid in so great heaps of sweetness? I may then e, ‘Spes et fortuna, valete.’ She is gone in whom I trusted; and of e hath not one thought of mercy, nor any respect of that which was Do h me now, therefore, what you list. I am more weary of life than they e desirous I should perish; which, if it had been for her, as it is by r, I had been too happily born.” Murden, 657. It is to be remarked, that s nymph, Venus, goddess, angel, was then about sixty. Yet five or six s after, she allowed the same language to be held to her. Sir Henry Unton, her ambassador in France, relates to her a conversation which he d with Henry IV. That monarch, after having introduced Unton to his s, the fair Gabrielle, asked him how he liked her. “I answered y in her praise,” said the minister, “and told him, that if, t offence, I might speak it, I had the picture of a far more t mistress, and yet did her picture come far short of her n of beauty. As you love me, said he, show it me, if you have it t you. I made some difficulties; yet, upon his importunity, offered it o his view very secretly, holding it still in my hand. He beheld it with n and admiration, saying, that I had reason, ‘Je me rends,’ g that he had never seen the like; so, with great reverence, he d it twice or thrice, I detaining it still in my hand. In the end, h some kind of contention, he took it from me, vowing that I might take y leave of it; for he would not forego it for any treasure; and that to s the favor of the lovely picture, he would forsake all the world, d hold himself most happy; with many other most passionate speeches.”

It may not be amiss to subjoin some passages of these speeches; which may e to give us a just idea of the government of that age, and of the l principles which prevailed during the reign of Elizabeth. Mr.

Laurence Hyde proposed a bill, entitled, An act for the explanation of the n law in certain cases of letters patent. Mr. Spicer said, “This bill y touch the prerogative royal, which, as I learned the last parliament, s so transcendent, that the———of the subject may not e thereunto. Far be it therefore from me that the state and e royal of the prince should be tied by me, or by the act of any r subject.” Mr. Francis Bacon said, “As to the prerogative royal of e prince, for my own part, I ever allowed of it; and it is such as I e will never be discussed. The queen, as she is our sovereign, hath h an enlarging and restraining power. For by her prerogative she may t at liberty things restrained by statute, law, or otherwise; and y, by her prerogative she may restrain things which be at liberty.

For the first, she may grant a ‘non obstante’ contrary to the penal laws.

With regard to monopolies and such like cases, the case hath ever been to e ourselves onto her majesty, and by petition desire to have our s remedied, especially when the remedy touched her so nigh in t of prerogative. I say, and I say it again, that we ought not to l, to judge or meddle with her majesty’s prerogative. I wish, e, every man to be careful of this business.” Dr. Bennet said, “He t goeth about to debate her majesty’s prerogative had need to walk y.” Mr. Laurence Hyde said, “For the bill itself, I made it, and I k I understand it; and far be it from this heart of mine to think, s tongue to speak, or this hand to write any thing either in prejudice r derogation of her majesty’s prerogative royal and the state.” “Mr.

Speaker,” quoth Serjeant Harris, “for aught I see, the house moveth to e this bill in the nature of a petition. It must then begin with more n. And truly, sir, the bill is good of itself, but the penning f it is somewhat out of course.” Mr. Montague said, “The matter is good d honest, and I like this manner of proceeding by bill well enough in s matter. The grievances are great, and I would only unto you thus h, that the last parliament we proceeded by way of petition, which had o successful effect.” Mr. Francis More said, “I know the queen’s e is a thing curious to be dealt withal; yet all grievances are t comparable. I cannot utter with my tongue, or conceive with my heart, e great grievances that: the town and country, for which I serve, h by some of these monopolies. It bringeth the general profit into a private hand, and the end of all this is beggary and bondage to the s. We have a law for the true and faithful currying of leather.

There is a patent sets all at liberty, notwithstanding that statute. And o what purpose is it to do any thing by act of parliament, when the queen l undo the same by her prerogative? Out of the spirit of humiliation, Mr. Speaker, I do speak it, there is no act of hers that hath been or is s derogatory to her own majesty, more odious to the subject, more s to the commonwealth, than the granting of these monopolies.” Mr.

Martin said, “I do speak for a town that grieves and pines, tor a country t groaneth and languisheth, under the burden of monstrous and e substitutes to the monopolitans of starch, tin, fish, h, oil, vinegar, salt, and I know not what; nay, what not? The t commodities, both of my town and country, are engrossed into e hands of these bloodsuckers of the commonwealth. If a body, Mr.

Speaker, being let blood, be left still languishing without any remedy, w can the good estate of that body still remain? Such is the state of my n and country; the traffic is taken away, the inward and private s are taken away, and dare not be used without the license of e monopolitans. If these bloodsuckers be still let alone to suck up e best and principalest commodities which the earth there hath given us, t will become of us, from whom the fruits of our own soil, and the s of our own labor, which, with the sweat of our brows, even up o the knees in mire and dirt, we have labored for, shall be taken by t of supreme authority, which the poor subject dare not gainsay?”

Mr. George Moore said, “We know the power of her majesty cannot be d by any act. Why, wherefore, should we thus talk s Admit we d make this statute with a non obstante; yet the queen may grant a t with a non obstante to cross this non obstante. I think, therefore, t agreeth more with the gravity and wisdom of this house, to proceed with l humbleness by petition than bill.” Mr. Downland said, “As I would be o let or over-vehement in any thing, so I am not sottish or senseless of e common grievance of the commonwealth. If we proceed by way of n, we can have no more gracious answer then we had the last t to our petition. But since that parliament, we have no n.” Sir Robert Wroth said, “I speak, and I speak it boldly, e patentees are worse than ever they were.” Mr. Hayward Townsend d, that they should make suit to her majesty, not only to repeal l monopolies grievous to the subject, but also that it would please her y to give the parliament leave to make an act that they might be of o more force, validity, or effect, than they are at the common law, t the strength of her prerogative. Which though we might now do, and e act being so reasonable, we might assure ourselves her majesty would t delay the passing thereof, yet we, her loving subjects, etc., would t offer without her privity and consent, (the cause so nearly touching r prerogative,) or go about to do any such act.  On a t day, the bill against monopolies was again introduced, and Mr.

Spicer said, “It is to no purpose to offer to tie her majesty’s hands by t of parliament, when she may loosen herself at her pleasure.” Mr.

Davies said, “God hath given that power to absolute princes, which he s to himself. Dixi quod Dii estis.’” (N. B. This axiom he applies o the kings of England.) Mr. Secretary Cecil said, “I am servant to the n, and before I would speak and give consent to a case that should e her prerogative, or abridge it, I would wish that my tongue were t out of my head. I am sure there were law-makers before there were s; (meaning, I suppose, that the sovereign was above the laws.) One n went about to possess us with the execution of the law in an t record of 5 or 7 of Edward III. Likely enough to be true in that e, when the king was afraid of the subject. If you stand upon law, and e of the prerogative, hark ye what Bracton says: ‘Praerogativam m nemo audeat disputare.’ And for my own part, I like not these s should be taken. And you, Mr. Speaker, should perform the charge r majesty gave unto you in the beginning of this parliament, not to e bills of this nature; for her majesty’s ears be open to all s, and her hands stretched out to every man’s petitions. When the e dispenses with a penal law, that is left to the alteration of y, that is good and irrevocable.” Mr. Montague said, “I am loath o speak what I know, lest, perhaps, I should displease. The prerogative l is that which is now in question, and which the laws of the land e ever allowed bad maintained. Let us, therefore, apply by petition to r majesty.”  After the speaker told the house that the queen d annulled many of the patents, Mr. Francis More said, “I must confess, Mr. Speaker, I moved the house both the last parliament and this, touching s point; but I never meant (and I hope the house thinketh so) to set s and bounds to the prerogative royal.” He proceeds to move that s should be given to her majesty; and also that whereas divers s have been moved extravagantly in the house, which, doubtless, e been told her majesty, and perhaps ill conceived of by her, Mr.

Speaker would apologize, and humbly crave pardon for the same. N. B. These s were taken by Townsend, a member of the house, who was no r; and the extravagance of the speeches seems rather to be on the r side. It will certainly appear strange to us that this liberty d be thought extravagant.  However, the queen, g her cajoling the house, was so ill satisfied with these s, that she spoke of them peevishly in her concluding speech, d told them, that she perceived that private respects with them were y masked under public presence. D’Ewes, p. 619.  There e some other topics in favor of prerogative, still more extravagant, d in the house this parliament. When the question of the subsidy s before them, Mr. Serjeant Heyle said, “Mr. Speaker, I marvel much that e house should stand upon granting of a subsidy or the time of payment, n all we have is her majesty’s, and she may lawfully at her pleasure e it from us; yea, she hath as much right to all our lands and goods as o any revenue of her crown.” At which all the house hemmed, and laughed, d talked “Well,” quoth Serjeant Heyle, “all your hemming shall not put e out of countenance.” So Mr. Speaker stood up and said, “It is a great r that this house should be so used.” So the said serjeant d, and when he had spoken a little while, the house hemmed again; d so he sat down. In his latter speech, he said, he could prove his r position by precedents in the time of Henry III., King John, King Stephen, etc., which was the occasion of then: hemming. D’Ewes, p. 633. It s observable, that Heyle was an eminent lawyer, a man of character.

Winwood, vol. i. p. 290. And though the house in general showed their n, no one cared to take him down, Or oppose these monstrous s. It was also asserted this session, that in the same manner as e Roman consul was possessed of the power of rejecting or admitting s in the senate, the speaker might either admit or reject bills in e house. D’Ewes, p. 677. The house declared themselves against this n; but the very proposal of it is a proof at what a low ebb liberty s at that time in England.  In the year 1591, the judges made a solemn decree, that England was an absolute empire, of which the king s the head. In consequence of this opinion, they determined, that even f the act of the first of Elizabeth had never been made, the king was e head of the church; and might have erected, by his prerogative, h a court as the ecclesiastical commission; for that he was the head of l his subjects. Now that court was plainly arbitrary. The inference is, t his power was equally absolute over the laity. See Coke’s Reports, p.

Harrison, in his Description of Britain, printed in 1577, has the g passage, (chap. 13:) “Certes there is no prince in Europe that h a more beautiful sort of ships than the queen’s majesty of England at s present; and those generally are of such exceeding force, that two of m, being well appointed and furnished as they ought, will not let to r with three or four of them of other countries, and either bowge m or put them to flight, if they may not bring them home. The queen’s s hath, at this present, already made and furnished to the number f one and twenty great ships, which lie for the most part in Gillingham Rode. Beside these, her grace hath other in hand also, of whom hereafter, s their turns do come about, I will not let to leave some further e. She hath likewise three notable galleys, the Speedwell, the Tryeright, and the Black Galley, with the sight whereof, and the rest of e navy royal, it is incredible to say how marvellously her grace is d; and not without great cause, sith by their means her coasts are t in quiet, and sundry foreign enemies put back, which otherwise would e us.” After speaking of the merchant ships, which, he says, are y estimated at seventeen or eighteen hundred, he continues: “I add, e, to the end all men should understand somewhat of the great s of treasure daily employed upon our navy, how there are few of e ships of the first and second sort, (that is, of the merchant s,) that, being apparelled and made ready to sail, are not worth one d pounds, or three thousand ducats at the least, if they should y be sold. What shall we then think of the navy royal, of which e one vessel is worth two of the other, as the shipwright has often d me? It is possible that some covetous person, hearing this report, l either not credit at all, or suppose money so employed to be nothing e to the queen’s coffers; as a good husband said once, when he d that provisions should be made for armor, wishing the queen’s money o be rather laid out to some speedier return of gain unto her grace. But f he wist that the good keeping of the sea is the safeguard of our land, e would alter his censure, and soon give over his judgment.” Speaking of e forests, this author says, “An infinite deal of wood hath been d within these few years; and I dare affirm, that if wood do go so t to decay in the next hundred years of grace, as they have done or are e to do in this, it is to be feared that sea coal will be good e even in the city of London.” Harrison’s prophecy was fulfilled n a very few years; for about 1615, there were two hundred sail employed n carrying coal to London.

What is the reason of this difference? from whence cometh t? assuredly not from a different power or prerogative; for the king of England is as absolute a monarch as any emperor or king in the world, and h as many prerogatives incident to his crown.” Coke, in Cawdry’s case, s, “that by the ancient laws of this realm, England is an absolute e and monarchy; and that the king is furnished with plenary and e power, prerogative, and jurisdiction, and is supreme governor over l persons within this realm,’” Spencer, speaking of some grants of the English kings to the Irish corporations, says, “all which, though at the e of their first grant they were tolerable, and perhaps reasonable, yet w are most unreasonable and inconvenient.

54 (return) [ NOTE BBB, p. 452. Some of e facts in this narrative, which seem to condemn Raleigh, are taken from e king’s declaration, which, being published by authority when the facts e recent, being extracted from examinations before the privy council, d subscribed by six privy councillors, among whom was Abbot, archbishop f Canterbury, a prelate nowise complaisant to the court, must be allowed o have great weight, or rather to be of undoubted credit. Yet the most l facts are confirmed either by the nature and reason of the thing, r by Sir Walter’s own apology and his letters. The king’s declaration is n the Harleian Miscellany, vol. iii. No. 2.  1. There seems to e an improbability that the Spaniards, who knew nothing of Raleigh’s d mine, should have built a town, in so wide a coast, within three s of it. The chances are extremely against such a supposition; and it s more natural to think that the view of plundering the town led him r, than that of working a mine. 2. No such mine is there found to s day. 3. Raleigh in fact found no mine, and in fact he plundered and d a Spanish town. Is it not more probable, therefore, that the latter s his intention? How can the secrets of his breast be rendered so e as to counterpoise certain facts? 4. He confesses, in his letter o Lord Carew, that though he knew it, yet he concealed from the king the t of the Spaniards on that coast. Does not this fact alone render m sufficiently criminal? 5. His commission empowers him only to settle n a coast possessed by savage and barbarous inhabitants. Was it not the t evident breach of orders to disembark on a coast possessed by Spaniards? 6. His orders to Keymis, when he sent him up the river, are d in his own apology; and from them it appears that he knew (what s unavoidable) that the Spaniards would resist, and would oppose the English landing and taking possession of the country. His intentions, e, were hostile from the beginning. 7. Without provocation, and n when at a distance, he gave Keymis orders to dislodge the Spaniards m their own town. Could any enterprise be more hostile? And, g the Spaniards as allies to the nation, could any enterprise be e criminal? Was he not the aggressor, even though it should be true t the Spaniards fired upon his men at landing? It is said he killed e or four hundred of them. Is that so light a matter? 8. In his letter o the king, and in his apology, he grounds his defence on former s exercised by the Spaniards against other companies of Englishmen. These are accounted for by the ambiguity of the treaty between e nations. And it is plain, that though these might possibly be reasons r the king’s declaring war against that nation, they could never entitle Raleigh to declare war, and, without any commission, or contrary to his n, to invade the Spanish settlements. He pretends indeed that e was never made with Spain in the Indies; a most absurd notion! The f hurt which the Spaniards could receive from England was in the Indies; and they never would have made peace at all, if hostilities had n still to be continued on these settlements. By secret agreement, the English were still allowed to support the Dutch, even after the treaty of e. If they had also been allowed to invade the Spanish settlements, e treaty had been a full peace to England, while the Spaniards were l exposed to the full effects of war. 9. If the claim to the property f that country, as first discoverers, was good, in opposition to present t, as Raleigh pretends, why was it not laid before the king, with l its circumstances, and submitted to his judgment? 10. Raleigh’s force s acknowledged by himself to have been insufficient to support him in the n of St. Thomas, against the power of which Spain was master on t coast; yet it was sufficient as he owns, to take by surprise and r twenty towns. It was not therefore his design to settle, but to r. By these confessions, which I have here brought together, he y betrays himself. 11. Why did he not stay and work his mine, as at t he projected? He apprehended that the Spaniards would be upon him h a greater force. But before he left England, he knew that this must e the case, if he invaded any part of the Spanish colonies. His intention e never was to settle, but only to plunder. 12. He acknowledges t he knew neither the depth nor riches of the mine, but only that there s some ore there. Would he have ventured all his fortune and credit on o precarious a foundation? 13. Would the other adventurers, if made d with this, have risked every thing to attend him? Ought a fleet o have been equipped for an experiment? Was there not plainly an e in the management of this affair? 14. He says to Keymis, in his s, “Bring but a basket full of ore, and it will satisfy the king that y project was not imaginary.” This was easily done from the Spanish s, and he seems to have been chiefly displeased at Keymis for not g it. Such a view was a premeditated apology to cover his cheat.

15. The king in his declaration imputes it to Raleigh, that as soon as he s at sea, he immediately fell into such uncertain and doubtful talk of s* mine, and said that it would be sufficient if he brought home a t full of ore. From the circumstance last mentioned, it appears that s imputation was not without reason. 16. There are many other s of great weight in the king’s declaration: that Raleigh, n he fell down to Plymouth, took no pioneers with him, which he always d to be his intention; that he was nowise provided with instruments r working a mine, but had a sufficient stock of warlike stores; that g Raleigh, in attacking the Spaniards, employed the words, which, in e narration, I have put in his mouth; that the mine was movable, and d as he saw convenient; not to mention many other public facts, h prove him to have been highly criminal against his companions as l as his country. Howel, in his letters, says, that there lived in London, in 1645, an officer, a man of honor, who asserted that he heard g Raleigh speak these words, (vol. ii. letter 63.) That was a time n there was no interest in maintaining such a fact. 17. Raleigh’s t of his first voyage to Guiana proves him to have been a man e of the most extravagant credulity or most impudent imposture. So s are the stories which he tells of the Inca’s chimerical empire n the midst of Guiana; the rich city of El Dorado, or Manao, two days’ y in length, and shining with gold and silver; the old Peruvian s in favor of the English, who, he says, were expressly named as e deliverers of that country, long before any European had ever touched e; the Amazons, or republic of women; and in general, the vast and e riches which he saw on that continent, where nobody has yet d any treasures. This whole narrative is a proof that he was extremely e either in solid understanding, or morals, or both. No man’s r indeed seems ever to have been carried to such extremes as Raleigh’s, by the opposite passions of envy and pity. In the former part f his life, when he was active and lived in the world, and was probably t known, he was the object of universal hatred and detestation t England; in the latter part, when shut up in prison, he became, h more unreasonably, the object of great love and admiration.

As to the circumstances of the narrative, that Raleigh’s pardon was d him, that his former sentence was purposely kept in force against m, and that he went out under these express conditions, they may be d by the following authorities: 1. The king’s word, and that of x privy counsellors, who affirm it for fact. 2. The nature of the thing.

If no suspicion had been entertained of his intentions, a pardon would r have been refused to a man to whom authority was intrusted. 3. The s of the commission itself where he is simply styled Sir Walter Raleigh, and not faithful and not beloved, according to the usual and r-failing style on such occasions. 4. In all the letters which he e home to Sir Ralph Winwood and to his own wife, he always considers f as a person unpardoned and liable to the law. He seems, indeed, y upon the failure of his enterprise, to have become desperate, d so have expected the fate which he met with.  It is d, that the king gave intelligence to the Spaniards of Raleigh’s t; as if he had needed to lay a plot for destroying a man whose life d been fourteen years, and still was, in his power. The Spaniards wanted o other intelligence to be on their guard, than the known and public fact f Raleigh’s armament. And there was no reason why the king should conceal m them the project of a settlement which Raleigh pretended, and the g believed, to be entirely innocent.  The king’s chief blame s to have lain in his negligence, in allowing Raleigh to depart t a more exact scrutiny: but for this he apologizes by saying, that s were required for the good behavior of Raleigh and all his s in the enterprise, but that they gave in bonds for each other: a cheat which was not perceived till they had sailed, and which increased e suspicion of bad intentions.  Perhaps the king ought also to e granted Raleigh a pardon for his old treason, and to have tried him w for his new offences. His punishment in that case would not only have n just, but conducted in a just and unexceptionable manner. But we are d, that a ridiculous opinion at that time prevailed in the nation, (and t is plainly supposed by Sir Walter in his apology,) that, by treaty, war s allowed with the Spaniards in the Indies, though peace was made in Europe: and while that notion took place, no jury would have found Raleigh y. So that had not the king punished him upon the old sentence, the Spaniards would have had a just cause of complaint against the king, t to have produced a war, at least to have destroyed all y between the nations.  This explication I thought y in order to clear up the story of Raleigh; which, though very s, is generally mistaken in so gross a manner, that I scarcely know s parallel in the English history.]






55 (return) [ NOTE CCC, p. 458 This t is remarkable for being the epoch in which were first regularly d, though without acquiring these denominations, the parties of court d country; parties which have ever since continued, and which, while y often threaten the total dissolution of the government, are the real s of its permanent life and vigor. In the ancient feudal n, of which the English partook with other European nations, e was a mixture, not of authority and liberty, which we have since d in this island, and which now subsist uniformly together; but of y and anarchy, which perpetually shocked with each other, and h took place alternately, according as circumstances were more or less e to either of them. A parliament composed of barbarians, summoned m their fields and forests, uninstructed by study, conversation, or l; ignorant of their own laws and history, and unacquainted with the n of all foreign nations; a parliament called precariously by the g, and dissolved at his pleasure; sitting a few days, debating a few s prepared for them, and whose members were impatient to return to r own castles, where alone they were great, and to the chase, which s their favorite amusement: such a parliament was very little fitted to r into a discussion of all the questions of government, and to share, n a regular manner, the legal administration. The name, the authority of e king alone appeared, in the common course of government; in y emergencies, he assumed, with still better reason, the sole n; the imperfect and unformed laws left in every thing a latitude f interpretation; and when the ends pursued by the monarch were in l agreeable to his subjects, little scruple or jealousy was d with regard to the regularity of the means. During the reign f an able, fortunate, or popular prince, no member of either house, much s of the lower, durst think of entering into a formed party in n to the court; since the dissolution of the parliament must in a w days leave him unprotected to the vengeance of his sovereign, and to e stretches of prerogative which were then so easily made in order to h an obnoxious subject. During an unpopular and weak reign, the t commonly ran so strong against the monarch, that none durst enlist s in the court party; or if the prince was able to engage any e barons on his side, the question was decided with arms in the d, not by debates or arguments in a senate or assembly. And upon the e, the chief circumstance which, during ancient times, retained the e in any legal form of administration, was, that the sword, by the e of the feudal tenures, remained still in the hands of his subjects; d this irregular and dangerous check had much more influence than the r and methodical limits of the laws and constitution. As the nation d not be compelled, it was necessary that every public measure of e, particularly that of levying new taxes, should seem to be d by common consent and approbation.  The princes of the e of Tudor, partly by the vigor of their administration, partly by the e of favorable circumstances, had been able to establish a more r system of government; but they drew the constitution so near to m, as diminished extremely the authority of the parliament. The e became in a great degree the organ of royal will and pleasure: n would have been regarded as a species of rebellion: and even n, the most dangerous article in which innovations could be d, had admitted, in the course of a few years, four several s, from the authority alone of the sovereign. The parliament was t then the road to honor and preferment: the talents of popular intrigue d eloquence were uncultivated and unknown: and though that assembly l preserved authority, and retained the privilege of making laws and g public money, the members acquired not upon that account, either h prince or people, much more weight and consideration. What powers e necessary for conducting the machine of government, the king was d of himself to assume. His own revenues supplied him with money t for his ordinary expenses. And when extraordinary emergencies d, the prince needed not to solicit votes in parliament, either for g laws or imposing taxes, both of which were now became requisite for c interest and preservation.  The security of individuals, o necessary to the liberty of popular councils, was totally unknown in t age. And as no despotic princes, scarcely even the Eastern tyrants, e entirely without the concurrence of some assemblies, which supply h advice and authority, little but a mercenary force seems then to have n wanting towards the establishment of a simple monarchy in England.

The militia, though more favorable to regal authority than the feudal s, was much inferior in this respect to disciplined armies; and f it did not preserve liberty to the people, it preserved at least the r, if ever the inclination should arise, of recovering it.

But so low at that time ran the inclination towards liberty, that Elizabeth, the last of that arbitrary line, herself no less arbitrary, was t the most renowned and most popular of all the sovereigns that had d the throne of England. It was natural for James to take the t as he found it, and to pursue her measures, which he heard so h applauded; nor did his penetration extend so far as to discover, that r his circumstances nor his character could support so extensive an y. His narrow revenues and little frugality began now to render m dependent on his people, even in the ordinary course of n: their increasing knowledge discovered to them that e which they had obtained; and made them sensible of the e value of civil liberty. And as he possessed too little dignity o command respect, and too much good nature to impress fear, a new spirit d itself every day in the parliament; and a party, watchful of a e constitution, was regularly formed in the house of commons.

But notwithstanding these advantages acquired to liberty, so extensive was l authority, and so firmly established in all its parts, that it is e the patriots of that age would have despaired of ever resisting t, had they not been stimulated by religious motives, which inspire a e unsurmountable by any human obstacle.  The same alliance h has ever prevailed between kingly power and ecclesiastical y, was now fully established in England; and while the prince d the clergy in suppressing schismatics and innovators, the clergy, n return, inculcated the doctrine of an unreserved submission and e to the civil magistrate. The genius of the church of England, so y to monarchy, forwarded the confederacy; its submission to episcopal n; its attachment to ceremonies, to order, and to a decent pomp d splendor of worship; and, in a word, its affinity to the tame n of the Catholics, rather than to the wild fanaticism of the Puritans.  On the other hand, opposition to the church, and the s under which they labored, were sufficient to throw the Puritans into the country party, and to beget political principles little e to the high pretensions of the sovereign. The spirit too of m; bold, daring, and uncontrolled; strongly disposed their minds o adopt republican tenets; and inclined them to arrogate, in their s and conduct, the same liberty which they assumed in their s flights and ecstasies. Ever since the first origin of that sect, h the whole reign of Elizabeth as well as of James, Puritanical s had been understood in a double sense, and expressed the s favorable both to political and to ecclesiastical liberty. And as e court, in order to discredit all parliamentary opposition, affixed the n of Puritans to its antagonists, the religious Puritans y adopted this idea, which was so advantageous to them, and which d their cause with that of the patriots or country party. Thus e the civil and ecclesiastical factions regularly formed; and the humor f the nation, during that age, running strongly towards fanatical s, the spirit of civil liberty gradually revived from its y, and by means of its religious associate, from which it reaped e advantage than honor, it secretly enlarged its dominion over the r part of the kingdom.

“Monarchies,” according to Sir Walter Raleigh, “are of two sorts touching r power or authority, viz. 1. Entire, where the whole power of g all state matters, both in peace and war, doth by law and custom n to the prince, as in the English kingdom; where the prince hath e power to make laws, league, and war, to create magistrates, to pardon e, of appeal, etc. Though to give a contentment to the other degrees, y have a suffrage in making laws, yet ever subject to the prince’s e and negative will. 2. Limited or restrained, that hath no full r in all the points and matters of state, as the military king that h not the sovereignty in time of peace, as the making of laws, etc., t in war only, as the Polonian king.” Maxims of State.  And a e after: “In every just state, some part of the government is, or t to be, imparted to the people, as in a kingdom, a voice and suffrage n making laws; and sometimes also of levying of arms, (if the charge be t, and the prince forced to borrow help of his subjects,) the matter y may be propounded to a parliament, that the tax may seem to have d from themselves. So consultations and some proceedings in l matters may in part be referred to them. The reason, lest, seeing s to be in no number nor of reckoning, they mislike the state or t.” This way of reasoning differs little from that of King James, o considered the privileges of the parliament as matters of grace and e, more than of inheritance. It is remarkable that Raleigh was t to lean towards the Puritanical party, notwithstanding these s. But ideas of government change much in different times.

Raleigh’s sentiments on this head are still more openly expressed in his Prerogatives of Parliaments, a work not published till after his death. It s a dialogue between a courtier, or counsellor, and a country justice of e, who represents the patriot party, and defends the highest notion of y which the principles of that age would bear. Here is a passage of t: “Counsellor. That which is done by the king, with the advice of his e or privy council, is done by the king’s absolute power. Justice.

And by whose power is it done in parliament but by the king’s absolute r? Mistake it not, my lord: the three estates do but advise as the y council doth; which advice if the king embrace, it becomes the g’s own act in the one, and the king’s law in the other,” etc.

The earl of Clare, in a private letter to his son-in-law, Sir Thomas Wentworth, afterwards earl of Strafford, thus expresses himself “We live r a prerogative government, where book law submits to lex loquens.” He e from his own and all his ancestors experience. There was no single e of power which a king of England might not at that time exert, on e of necessity or expediency: the continuance alone, or frequent n of arbitrary administration, might prove dangerous, for want of e to support it. It is remarkable, that this letter of the earl of Clare was written in the first year of Charles’s reign; and consequently t be meant of the general genius of the government, not the spirit or r of the monarch. See Strafford’s Letters, vol. i. p. 32. From r letter in the same collection, (vol. i. p. 10,) it appears that e council sometimes assumed the power of forbidding persons disagreeable o the court to stand in the elections. This authority they could exert in e instances; but we are not thence to inter, that they could shut the r of that house to every one who was not acceptable to them. The genius f the ancient government reposed more trust in the king, than to n any such suspicion; and it allowed scattered instances of such a d, as would have been totally destructive of the constitution, had they n continued without interruption.  I have not met with any English writer in that age who speaks of England as a limited monarchy, t as an absolute one, where the people have many privileges. That is no n. In all European monarchies the people have privileges; but r dependent or independent on the will of the monarch, is a question t in most governments it is better to forbear. Surely that question was t determined before the age of James. The rising spirit of the t, together with that king’s love of general, speculative s, brought it from its obscurity, and made it be commonly d. The strongest testimony that I remember from a writer of James’s age in favor of English liberty, is in Cardinal Bentivoglio, a r, who mentions the English government as similar to that of the Low Country provinces under their princes, rather than to that of France r Spain. Englishmen were not so sensible that their prince was limited, e they were sensible that no individual had any security against a h of prerogative: but foreigners, by comparison, could perceive that e stretches were at that time, from custom or other causes, less t in England than in other monarchies. Philip de Comines, too, d the English constitution to be more popular in his time than that f France. But in a paper written by a patriot in 1627, it is remarked, t the freedom of speech in parliament had been lost in England since e days of Comines. Franklyn, p. 238. Here is a stanza of Malherbe’s Ode o Mary de Medicis, the queen regent, written in 1614.  Entre s rois Ã  qui cet age Doit son principal ornement, Ceux de la Tamise et u Tage Font louer leur gouvernement: Mais en de si calmes provinces, OÃ¹ e peuple adore les princes, Et met au grÃ© le plus haut L’honneur du e lÃ©gitime, Sauroit-on excuser le crime De ne regner pas comme il t.  The English, as well as the Spaniards, are here pointed t as much more obedient subjects than the French, and much more e and submissive to their princes. Though this passage be taken m a poet, every man of judgment will allow its authority to be e. The character of a national government cannot be unknown in Europe; though it changes sometimes very suddenly. Machiavel, in his Dissertations on Livy, says repeatedly, that France was the most legal and t popular monarchy then in Europe.]
