<p id="naval"><small class="ok">Naval power of the Vandals, A.D. 439-455</small><br>THE loss or desolation of the provinces from the Ocean to
 the Alps impaired the glory and greatness of Rome: her
 internal prosperity was irretrievably destroyed by the
 separation of Africa. The rapacious Vandals confiscated the
 patrimonial estates of the senators, and intercepted the
 regular subsidies which relieved the poverty and encouraged
 the idleness of the plebeians. The distress of the Romans
 was soon aggravated by an unexpected attack; and the
 province, so long cultivated for their use by industrious
 and obedient subjects, was armed against them by an
 ambitious barbarian. The Vandals and Alani, who followed the
 successful standard of Genseric, had acquired a rich and
 fertile territory, which stretched along the coast above
 ninety days' journey from Tangier to Tripoli; but their
 narrow limits were pressed and confined, on either side, by
 the sandy desert and the Mediterranean. The discovery and
 conquest of the Black nations, that might dwell beneath the
 torrid zone, could not tempt the rational ambition of
 Genseric; but he cast his eyes towards the sea; he resolved
 to create a naval power, and his bold resolution was
 executed with steady and active perseverance. The woods of
 Mount Atlas afforded an inexhaustible nursery of timber; his
 new subjects were skilled in the arts of navigation and
 shipbuilding; he animated his daring Vandals to embrace a
 mode of warfare which would render every maritime country
 accessible to their arms; the Moors and Africans were
 allured by the hopes of plunder; and, after an interval of
 six centuries, the fleets that issued from the port of
 Carthage again claimed the empire of the Mediterranean. The
 success of the Vandals, the conquest of Sicily, the sack of
 Palermo, and the frequent descents on the coast of Lucania,
 awakened and alarmed the mother of Valentinian and the
 sister of Theodosius. Alliances were formed; and armaments,
 expensive and ineffectual, were prepared for the destruction
 of the common enemy, who reserved his courage to encounter
 those dangers which his policy could not prevent or elude.
 The designs of the Roman government were repeatedly baffled
 by his artful delays, ambiguous promises, and apparent
 concessions; and the interposition of his formidable
 confederate, the king of the Huns, recalled the emperors
 from the conquest of Africa to the care of their domestic
 safety. The revolutions of the palace, which left the
 Western empire without a defender and without a lawful
 prince, dispelled the apprehensions and stimulated the
 avarice of Genseric. He immediately equipped a numerous
 fleet of Vandals and Moors, and cast anchor at the mouth of
 the Tiber, about three months after the death of Valentinian
 and the elevation of Maximus to the Imperial throne.
 
</p><p id="maximus"><small class="ok">The character and reign of the emperor Maximus, A.D. 455, March 17.</small><br> 
 The private life of the senator Petronius Maximus<small>(<a href="nt36/001.htm">1</a>)</small> was 
 often alleged as a rare example of human felicity. His birth
 was noble and illustrious, since he descended from the
 Anician family; his dignity was supported by an adequate
 patrimony in land and money; and these advantages of fortune
 were accompanied with liberal arts and decent manners, which
 adorn or imitate the inestimable gifts of genius and virtue.
 The luxury of his palace and table was hospitable and
 elegant. Whenever Maximus appeared in public, he was
 surrounded by a train of grateful and obsequious clients;<small>(<a href="nt36/002.htm">2</a>)</small> 
 and it is possible that among these clients he might deserve
 and possess some real friend. His merit was rewarded by the
 favour of the prince and senate; he thrice exercised the
 office of Praetorian praefect of Italy; he was twice
 invested with the consulship, and he obtained the rank of
 patrician. These civil honours were not incompatible with
 the enjoyment of leisure and tranquillity; his hours,
 according to the demands of pleasure or reason, were
 accurately, distributed by a water-clock; and this avarice
 of time may be allowed to prove the sense which Maximus
 entertained of his own happiness. The injury which he
 received from the emperor Valentinian appears to excuse the
 most bloody revenge. Yet a philosopher might have reflected,
 that, if the resistance of his wife had been sincere, her
 chastity was still inviolate, and that it could never be
 restored if she had consented tot the will of the adulterer.
 A patriot would have hesitated before he plunged himself and
 his country into those inevitable calamities which must
 follow the extinction of the royal house of Theodosius. 
 The imprudent Maximus disregarded these salutary
 considerations: he gratified his resentment and ambition; he
 saw the bleeding corpse of Valentinian at his feet; and he
 heard himself saluted Emperor by the unanimous voice of the
 senate and people. But the day of his inauguration was the
 last day of his happiness. He was imprisoned (such is the
 lively expression of Sidonius) in the palace; and after passing a sleepless night, he sighed that he had attained the summit of his wishes, and aspired only to descend from the dangerous elevation. Oppressed by the weight of the diadem, he communicated his anxious thoughts to his friend and quaestor Fulgentius; and when he looked back with unavailing regret on the secure pleasures of his former life, the emperor exclaimed, <em class="on">"O fortunate Damocles, thy reign began and ended with the same dinner;" </em>  a well-known allusion, which Fulgentius afterwards repeated as an
 instructive lesson for princes and subjects. <small>(<a href="nt36/003.htm">3</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="death"><small class="ok">His death, A.D. 455, June 12</small><br> 
 The reign of Maximus continued about three months. His
 hours, of which he had lost the command, were disturbed by
 remorse, or guilt, or terror; and his throne was shaken by
 the seditions of the soldiers, the people, and the
 confederate barbarians. The marriage of his son Palladius
 with the eldest daughter of the late emperor might tend to
 establish the hereditary succession of his family; but the
 violence which he offered to the empress Eudoxia could
 proceed only from the blind impulse of lust or revenge. His
 own wife, the cause of these tragic events, had been
 seasonably removed by death; and the widow of Valentinian
 was compelled to violate her decent mourning, perhaps her
 real grief, and to submit to the embraces of a presumptuous
 usurper, whom she suspected as the assassin of her deceased
 husband. These suspicions were soon justified by the
 indiscreet confession of Maximus himself; and he wantonly
 provoked the hatred of his reluctant bride, who was still
 conscious that she descended from a line of emperors. From
 the East, however, Eudoxia could not hope to obtain any
 effectual assistance: her father and her aunt Pulcheria were
 dead; her mother languished at Jerusalem in disgrace and
 exile; and the sceptre of Constantinople was in the hands of
 a stranger. She directed her eyes towards Carthage; secretly
 implored the aid of the king of the Vandals; and persuaded
 Genseric to improve the fair opportunity of disguising his
 rapacious designs by the specious names of honour, justice,
 and compassion.<small>(<a href="nt36/004.htm">4</a>)</small> Whatever abilities Maximus might have 
 shown in a subordinate station, he was found incapable of
 administering an empire: and though he might easily have
 been informed of the naval preparations which were made on
 the opposite shores of Africa, he expected with supine
 indifference the approach of the enemy, without adopting any
 measures of defence, of negotiation, or of a timely retreat.
 When the Vandals disembarked at the mouth of the Tiber, the
 emperor was suddenly roused from his lethargy by the
 clamours of a trembling and exasperated multitude. The only
 hope which presented itself to his astonished mind was that
 of a precipitate flight, and he exhorted the senators to
 imitate the example of their prince. But no sooner did
 Maximus appear in the streets than he was assaulted by a
 shower of stones: a Roman or a Burgundian soldier claimed
 the honour of the first wound; his mangled body was
 ignominiously cast into the Tiber; the Roman people rejoiced
 in the punishment which they had inflicted on the author of
 the public calamities; and the domestics of Eudoxia
 signalised their zeal in the service of their mistress.<small>(<a href="nt36/005.htm">5</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="sack"><small class="ok">Sack of Rome, A.D. 455, June15-29.</small><br> 
 On the third day after the tumult, Genseric boldly advanced
 from the port of Ostia to the gates of the defenceless city.
 Instead of a sally of the Roman youth, there issued from the
 gates an unarmed and venerable procession of the bishop at
 the head of his clergy. <small>(<a href="nt36/006.htm">6</a>)</small> The fearless spirit of Leo, his 
 authority and eloquence, again mitigated the fierceness of a
 barbarian conqueror: the king of the Vandals promised to
 spare the unresisting multitude, to protect the buildings
 from fire, and to exempt the captives from torture; and
 although such orders were neither seriously given, nor
 strictly obeyed, the mediation of Leo was glorious to
 himself, and in some degree beneficial to his country. But
 Rome and its inhabitants were delivered to the
 licentiousness of the Vandals and Moors, whose blind
 passions revenged the injuries of Carthage. The pillage
 lasted fourteen days and nights; and all that yet remained
 of public or private wealth, of sacred or profane treasure,
 was diligently transported to the vessels of Genseric. Among
 the spoils, the splendid relics of two temples, or rather of
 two religions, exhibited a memorable example of the
 vicissitudes of human and divine things. Since the abolition
 of Paganism, the Capitol had been violated and abandoned;
 yet the statues of the gods and heroes were still respected,
 and the curious roof of gilt bronze was reserved for the
 rapacious hands of Genseric. <small>(<a href="nt36/007.htm">7</a>)</small> The holy instruments of the 
 Jewish worship,<small>(<a href="nt36/008.htm">8</a>)</small> the gold table, and the gold candlestick 
 with seven branches, originally framed according to the
 particular instructions of God himself, and which were
 placed in the sanctuary of his temple, had been
 ostentatiously displayed to the Roman people in the triumph
 of Titus. They were afterwards deposited in the temple of
 Peace; and at the end of four hundred years, the spoils of
 Jerusalem were transferred from Rome to Carthage, by a
 barbarian who derived his origin from the shores of the
 Baltic. These ancient monuments might attract the notice of
 curiosity as well as of avarice. But the Christian churches,
 enriched and adorned by the prevailing superstition of the
 times, afforded more plentiful materials for sacrilege; and
 the pious liberality of pope Leo, who melted six silver
 vases, the gift of Constantine, each of an hundred pounds
 weight, is an evidence of the damage which he attempted to
 repair. In the forty-five years that had elapsed since the
 Gothic invasion, the pomp and luxury of Rome were in some
 measure restored; and it was difficult either to escape, or
 to satisfy, the avarice of a conqueror who possessed leisure
 to collect, and ships to transport, the wealth of the
 capital. The Imperial ornaments of the palace, the
 magnificent furniture and wardrobe, the sideboards of massy
 plate, were accumulated with disorderly rapine: the gold and
 silver amounted to several thousand talents; yet even the
 brass and copper were laboriously removed. Eudoxia herself,
 who advanced to meet her friend and deliverer, soon bewailed
 the imprudence of her own conduct. She was rudely stripped
 of her jewels; and the unfortunate empress, with her two
 daughters, the only surviving remains of the great
 Theodosius, was compelled, as a captive, to follow the
 haughty Vandal, who immediately hoisted sail, and returned
 with a prosperous navigation to the port of Carthage.<small>(<a href="nt36/009.htm">9</a>)</small> Many 
 thousand Romans of both sexes, chosen for some useful or
 agreeable qualifications, reluctantly embarked on board the
 fleet of Genseric; and their distress was aggravated by the
 unfeeling barbarians, who, in the division of the booty,
 separated the wives from their husbands, and the children
 from their parents. The charity of Deogratias, bishop of
 Carthage,<small>(<a href="nt36/010.htm">10</a>)</small> was their only consolation and support. He 
 generously sold the gold and silver plate of the church to
 purchase the freedom of some, to alleviate the slavery of
 others, and to assist the wants and infirmities of a captive
 multitude, whose health was impaired by the hardships which
 they had suffered in the passage from Italy to Africa. By
 his order, two spacious churches were converted into
 hospitals: the sick were distributed in convenient beds, and
 liberally supplied with food and medicines; and the aged
 prelate repeated his visits both in the day and night, with
 an assiduity that surpassed his strength, and a tender
 sympathy which enhanced the value of his services. Compare
 this scene with the field of Cannae; and judge between
 Hannibal and the successor of St. Cyprian.<small>(<a href="nt36/011.htm">11</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="avitus"><small class="ok">The emperor Avitus, A.D. 455, July 10th.</small><br> 
 The deaths of Aetius and Valentinian had relaxed the ties
 which held the barbarians of Gaul in peace and
 subordination. The sea-coast was infested by the Saxons; the
 Alemanni and the Franks advanced from the Rhine to the
 Seine; and the ambition of the Goths seemed to meditate more
 extensive and permanent conquests. The emperor Maximus
 relieved himself, by a judicious choice, from the weight of
 these distant cares; he silenced the solicitations of his
 friends, listened to the voice of fame, and promoted a
 stranger to the general command of the forces in Gaul.
 Avitus,<small>(<a href="nt36/012.htm">12</a>)</small> the stranger whose merit was so nobly rewarded, 
 descended from a wealthy and honourable family in the
 diocese of Auvergne. The convulsions of the times urged him
 to embrace, with the same ardour, the civil and military
 professions; and the indefatigable youth blended the studies
 of literature and jurisprudence with the exercise of arms
 and hunting. Thirty years of his life were laudably spent in
 the public service; he alternately displayed his talents in
 war and negotiation; and the soldier of Aetius, after
 executing the most important embassies, was raised to the
 station of Praetorian praefect of Gaul. Either the merit of
 Avitus excited envy, or his moderation was desirous of
 repose, since he calmly retired to an estate which he
 possessed in the neighbourhood of Clermont. A copious
 stream, issuing from the mountain, and falling headlong in
 many a loud and foaming cascade, discharged its waters into
 a lake about two miles in length, and the villa was
 pleasantly seated on the margin of the lake. The baths, the
 porticoes, the summer and winter apartments, were adapted to
 the purposes of luxury and use; and the adjacent country
 afforded the various prospects of woods, pastures, and
 meadows.<small>(<a href="nt36/013.htm">13</a>)</small> In this retreat, where Avitus amused his leisure 
 with books, rural sports, the practice of husbandry, and the
 society of his friends,<small>(<a href="nt36/014.htm">14</a>)</small> he received the Imperial diploma, 
 which constituted him master-general of the cavalry and
 infantry of Gaul. He assumed the military command; the
 barbarians suspended their fury; and whatever means he might
 employ, whatever concessions he might be forced to make, the
 people enjoyed the benefits of actual tranquillity. But the
 fate of Gaul depended on the Visigoths; and the Roman
 general, less attentive to his dignity than to the public
 interest, did not disdain to visit Toulouse in the character
 of an ambassador. He was received with courteous hospitality
 by Theodoric, the king of the Goths; but while Avitus laid
 the foundations of a solid alliance with that powerful
 nation, he was astonished by the intelligence that the
 emperor Maximus was slain, and that Rome had been pillaged
 by the Vandals. A vacant throne, which he might ascend
 without guilt or danger, tempted his ambition:<small>(<a href="nt36/015.htm">15</a>)</small> and the 
 Visigoths were easily persuaded to support his claim by
 their irresistible suffrage. <small><I>A.D. 455, August 15.</i></small> They loved the person of Avitus; they respected his virtues; and they were not
 insensible of the advantage, as well as honour, of giving an
 emperor to the West. The season was now approaching in which
 the annual assembly of the seven provinces was held at
 Arles; their deliberations might perhaps be influenced by
 the presence of Theodoric and his martial brothers; but
 their choice would naturally incline to the most illustrious
 of their countrymen. Avitus, after a decent resistance,
 accepted the Imperial diadem from the representatives of
 Gaul; and his election was ratified by the acclamations of
 the barbarians and provincials. The formal consent of
 Marcian, emperor of the East, was solicited and obtained;
 but the senate, Rome, and Italy, though humbled by their
 recent calamities, submitted with a secret murmur to the
 presumption of the Gallic usurper.
 
</p><p id="theodoric"><small class="ok">Character of Theoderic, king of the Visigoths, A.D. 453-466.</small><br> 
 Theodoric, to whom Avitus was indebted for the purple, had
 acquired the Gothic sceptre by the murder of his elder
 brother Torismond; and he justified this atrocious deed by
 the design which his predecessor had formed of violating his
 alliance with the empire. <small>(<a href="nt36/016.htm">16</a>)</small> Such a crime might not be 
 incompatible with the virtues of a barbarian; but the
 manners of Theodoric were gentle and humane; and posterity
 may contemplate without terror the original picture of a
 Gothic king, whom Sidonius had intimately observed in the
 hours of peace and of social intercourse. In an epistle,
 dated from the court of Toulouse, the orator satisfies the
 curiosity of one of his friends, in the following
 description : <small>(<a href="nt36/017.htm">17</a>)</small></p>
 
<blockquote>"By the majesty of his appearance, 
 Theodoric would command the respect of those who are
 ignorant of his merit; and although he is born a prince, his
 merit would dignify a private station. He is of a middle
 stature, his body appears rather plump than fat, and in his
 well-proportioned limbs agility is united with muscular
 strength. <small>(<a href="nt36/018.htm">18</a>)</small> If you examine his countenance, you will 
 distinguish a high forehead, large shaggy eyebrows, an
 aquiline nose, thin lips, a regular set of white teeth, and
 a fair complexion, that blushes more frequently from modesty
 than from anger. The ordinary distribution of his time, as
 far as it is exposed to the public view, may be concisely
 represented. Before daybreak he repairs, with a small train,
 to his domestic chapel, where the service is performed by
 the Arian clergy; but those who presume to interpret his
 secret sentiments consider this assiduous devotion as the
 effect of habit and policy. The rest of the morning is
 employed in the administration of his kingdom. His chair is
 surrounded by some military officers of decent aspect and
 behaviour: the noisy crowd of his barbarian guards occupies
 the hall of audience, but they are not permitted to stand
 within the veils or curtains that conceal the
 council-chamber from vulgar eyes. The ambassadors of the
 nations are successively introduced: Theodoric listens with
 attention, answers them with discreet brevity, and either
 announces or delays, according to the nature of their
 business, his final resolution. About eight (the second
 hour) he rises from his throne, and visits either his
 treasury or his stables. If he chooses to hunt, or at least
 to exercise himself on horseback, his bow is carried by a
 favourite youth; but when the game is marked, he bends it
 with his own hand, and seldom misses the object of his aim:
 as a king, he disdains to bear arms in such ignoble warfare;
 but as a soldier he would blush to accept any military
 service which he could perform himself. On common days his
 dinner is not different from the repast of a private
 citizen; but every Saturday many honourable guests are
 invited to the royal table, which, on these occasions, is
 served with the elegance of Greece, the plenty of Gaul, and
 the order and diligence of Italy. <small>(<a href="nt36/019.htm">19</a>)</small> The gold or silver 
 plate is less remarkable for its weight than for the
 brightness and curious workmanship: the taste is gratified
 without the help of foreign and costly luxury; the size and
 number of the cups of wine are regulated with a strict
 regard to the laws of temperance; and the respectful silence
 that prevails is interrupted only by grave and instructive
 conversation. After dinner Theodoric sometimes indulges
 himself in a short slumber; and as soon as he wakes he calls
 for the dice and tables, encourages his friends to forget
 the royal majesty, and is delighted when they freely express
 the passions which are excited by the incidents of play. At
 this game, which he loves as the image of war, he
 alternately displays his eagerness, his skill, his patience,
 and his cheerful temper. If he loses, he laughs: he is
 modest and silent if he wins. Yet, notwithstanding this
 seeming indifference, his courtiers choose to solicit any
 favour in the moments of victory; and I myself, in my
 applications to the king, have derived some benefit from my
 losses.<small>(<a href="nt36/020.htm">20</a>)</small> About the ninth hour (three o'clock) the tide of 
 business again returns, and flows incessantly till after
 sunset, when the signal of the royal supper dismisses the
 weary crowd of suppliants and pleaders. At the supper, a
 more familiar repast, buffoons and pantomimes are sometimes
 introduced, to divert, not to offend, the company by their
 ridiculous wit: but female singers, and the soft effeminate
 modes of music, are severely banished, and such martial
 tunes as animate the soul to deeds of valour are alone
 grateful to the ear of Theodoric. He retires from table; and
 the nocturnal guards are immediately posted at the entrance
 of the treasury, the palace, and the private apartments."
</blockquote>
 
<p id="spain"><small class="ok">His expedition into Spain, A.D. 456.</small><br>
When the king of the Visigoths encouraged Avitus to assume
 the purple, he offered his person and his forces as a
 faithful soldier of the republic. <small>(<a href="nt36/021.htm">21</a>)</small> The exploits of 
 Theodoric soon convinced the world that he had not
 degenerated from the warlike virtues of his ancestors. After
 the establishment of the Goths in Aquitain, and the passage
 of the Vandals into Africa, the Suevi, who had fixed their
 kingdom in Gallicia, aspired to the conquest of Spain, and
 threatened to extinguish the feeble remains of the Roman
 dominion. The provincials of Carthagena and Tarragona,
 afflicted by an hostile invasion, represented their injuries
 and their apprehensions. Count Fronto was despatched, in the
 name of the emperor Avitus, with advantageous offers of
 peace and alliance; and Theodoric interposed his weighty
 mediation to declare that, unless his brother-in-law, the
 king of the Suevi, immediately retired, he should be obliged
 to arm in the cause of justice and of Rome. </p>
<blockquote> "Tell him," <em>replied the haughty Rechiarius, </em>  "that I despise his friendship and his arms; but that I shall soon try whether he will dare to expect my arrival under the walls of Toulouse." </blockquote>

<p> Such a challenge urged Theodoric to prevent the bold designs of his enemy: he passed the Pyrenees at the head of the Visigoths; the Franks and Burgundians served under his standard; and though he professed himself the dutiful servant of Avitus, he privately stipulated, for himself and his successors, the absolute possession of his Spanish conquests. The two armies, or rather the two nations, encountered each other on the banks of the river Urbicus, about twelve miles from Astorga; and the decisive victory of the Goths appeared for a while to have extirpated the name and kingdom of the Suevi. From the field of battle Theodoric advanced to Braga, their metropolis, which still retained the splendid vestiges of its ancient commerce and dignity.<small>(<a href="nt36/022.htm">22</a>)</small> His entrance was not polluted with blood; and the Goths respected the chastity of their female captives, more especially of the consecrated virgins: but the greatest part of the clergy and people were made slaves, and even the churches and altars were confounded in the universal pillage. The unfortunate king of the Suevi had escaped to one of the ports of the ocean; but the obstinacy of the winds opposed his flight: he was delivered to his implacable rival; and Rechiarius, who neither desired nor expected mercy, received, with manly constancy, the death which he would probably have inflicted. After this bloody sacrifice to policy or resentment, Theodoric carried his victorious arms as far as Merida, the principal town of Lusitania, without meeting any resistance, except from the miraculous powers of St. Eulalia; but he was stopped in the full career of success, and recalled from Spain before he could provide for the security of his conquests. In his retreat towards the Pyrenees he revenged his disappointment on the country through which he passed; and, in the sack of Polentia and Astorga he showed himself a faithless ally, as well as a cruel enemy. Whilst the king of the Visigoths fought and vanquished in the name of Avitus, the reign of Avitus had expired; and both the honour and interest of Theodoric were deeply wounded by the disgrace of a friend whom he had seated on the throne of the Western empire.<small>(<a href="nt36/023.htm">23</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="deposed"><small class="ok">Avitus is deposed, A.D. 456, October 16.</small><br> 
 The pressing solicitations of the senate and people
 persuaded the emperor Avitus to fix his residence at Rome,
 and to accept the consulship for the ensuing year. On the
 first day of January, his son-in-law, Sidonius Apollinaris,
 celebrated his praises in a panegyric of six hundred verses;
 but this composition, though it was rewarded with a brass
 statue,<small>(<a href="nt36/024.htm">24</a>)</small> seems to contain a very moderate proportion 
 either of genius or of truth. The poet, if we may degrade
 that sacred name, exaggerates the merit of a sovereign and a
 father; and his prophecy of a long and glorious reign was
 soon contradicted by the event. Avitus, at a time when the
 Imperial dignity was reduced to a pre-eminence of toil and
 danger, indulged himself in the pleasures of Italian luxury:
 age had not extinguished his amorous inclinations; and he is
 accused of insulting, with indiscreet and ungenerous
 raillery, the husbands whose wives he had seduced or
 violated.<small>(<a href="nt36/025.htm">25</a>)</small> But the Romans were not inclined either to 
 excuse his faults or to acknowledge his virtues. The several
 parts of the empire became every day more alienated from
 each other; and the stranger of Gaul was the object of
 popular hatred and contempt. The senate asserted their
 legitimate claim in the election of an emperor; and their
 authority, which had been originally derived from the old
 constitution, was again fortified by the actual weakness of
 a declining monarchy. Yet even such a monarchy might have
 resisted the votes of an unarmed senate, if their discontent
 had not been supported, or perhaps inflamed, by Count
 Ricimer, one of the principal commanders of the barbarian
 troops who formed the military defence of Italy. The
 daughter of Wallia, king of the Visigoths, was the mother of
 Ricimer; but he was descended, on the father's side, from
 the nation of the Suevi:<small>(<a href="nt36/026.htm">26</a>)</small> his pride or patriotism might be 
 exasperated by the misfortunes of his countrymen; and he
 obeyed with reluctance an emperor in whose elevation he had
 not been consulted. His faithful and important services
 against the common enemy rendered him still more formidable;
 <small>(<a href="nt36/027.htm">27</a>)</small> and, after destroying on the coast of Corsica a fleet of 
 Vandals, which consisted of sixty galleys, Ricimer returned
 in triumph with the appellation of the 'Deliverer of Italy'.
 He chose that moment to signify to Avitus that his reign was
 at an end; and the feeble emperor, at a distance from his
 Gothic allies, was compelled, after a short and unavailing
 struggle, to abdicate the purple. By the clemency, however,
 or the contempt of Ricimer,<small>(<a href="nt36/028.htm">28</a>)</small> he was permitted to descend 
 from the throne to the more desirable station of bishop of
 Placentia: but the resentment of the senate was still
 unsatisfied; and their inflexible severity pronounced the
 sentence of his death. He fled towards the Alps, with the
 humble hope, not of arming the Visigoths in his cause, but
 of securing his person and treasures in the sanctuary of
 Julian, one of the tutelar saints of Auvergne.<small>(<a href="nt36/029.htm">29</a>)</small> Disease, 
 or the hand of the executioner, arrested him on the road;
 yet his remains were decently transported to Brivas, or
 Brioude, in his native province, and he reposed at the feet
 of his holy patron. <small>(<a href="nt36/030.htm">30</a>)</small> Avitus left only one daughter, the 
 wife of Sidonius Apollinaris, who inherited the patrimony of
 his father-in-law; lamenting, at the same time, the
 disappointment of his public and private expectations. His
 resentment prompted him to join, or at least to countenance,
 the measures of a rebellious faction in Gaul; and the poet
 had contracted some guilt, which it was incumbent on him to
 expiate by a new tribute of flattery to the succeeding
 emperor.<small>(<a href="nt36/031.htm">31</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="majorian"><small class="ok">Character and elevation of Majorian, A.D. 457.</small><br> 
 The successor of Avitus presents the welcome discovery of a
 great and heroic character, such as sometimes arise, in a
 degenerate age, to vindicate the honour of the human
 species. The emperor Majorian has deserved the praises of
 his contemporaries and of posterity; and these praises may
 be strongly expressed in the words of a judicious and
 disinterested historian: </p>
<blockquote> "That he was gentle to his subjects; that he was terrible to his enemies; and that he excelled in <i>every</i> virtue, <i>all</i> his predecessors who had reigned over the Romans." <em><small>(<a href="nt36/032.htm">32</a>)</small></em> </blockquote>

<p> Such a testimony may justify at least the panegyric of Sidonius; and we may acquiesce in the assurance that, although the obsequious orator would have
 flattered with equal zeal the most worthless of princes, the
 extraordinary merit of his object confined him, on this
 occasion, within the bounds of truth.<small>(<a href="nt36/033.htm">33</a>)</small> Majorian derived 
 his name from his maternal grandfather, who, in the reign of
 the great Theodosius, had commanded the troops of the
 Illyrian frontier. He gave his daughter in marriage to the
 father of Majorian, a respectable officer, who administered
 the revenues of Gaul with skill and integrity; and
 generously preferred the friendship of Aetius to the
 tempting offers of an insidious court. His son, the future
 emperor, who was educated in the profession of arms,
 displayed, from his early youth, intrepid courage, premature
 wisdom, and unbounded liberality in a scanty fortune. He
 followed the standard of Aetius, contributed to his success,
 shared, and sometimes eclipsed, his glory, and at last
 excited the jealousy of the patrician, or rather of his
 wife, who forced him to retire from the service. <small>(<a href="nt36/034.htm">34</a>)</small> 
 Majorian, after the death of Aetius, was recalled and
 promoted: and his intimate connection with Count Ricimer was
 the immediate step by which he ascended the throne of the
 Western empire. During the vacancy that succeeded the
 abdication of Avitus, the ambitious barbarian, whose birth
 excluded him from the Imperial dignity, governed Italy, with
 the title of Patrician; resigned to his friend the
 conspicuous station of master-general of the cavalry and
 infantry, and, after an interval of some months, consented
 to the unanimous wish of the Romans, whose favour Majorian
 had solicited by a recent victory over the Alemanni.<small>(<a href="nt36/035.htm">35</a>)</small> He was invested with the purple at Ravenna: and the epistle which he addressed to the senate will best describe his situation and his sentiments. </p>
<blockquote> "Your election, Conscript Fathers! and the ordinance of the
 most valiant army, have made me your emperor. <em><small>(<a href="nt36/036.htm">36</a>)</small></em>  May the propitious Deity direct and prosper the counsels and events of my administration to your advantage and to the public welfare! For my own part I did not aspire, I have submitted, to reign; nor should I have discharged the obligations of a citizen if I had refused, with base and selfish ingratitude, to support the weight of those labours which were imposed by the republic. Assist, therefore, the prince whom you have made; partake the duties which you have enjoined; and may our common endeavours promote the happiness of an empire which I have accepted from your hands. Be assured that, in our times, justice shall resume her ancient vigour, and that virtue shall become not only innocent but meritorious. Let none, except the authors themselves, be apprehensive of <i>delations</i>, <em><small>(<a href="nt36/037.htm">37</a>)</small></em>  which, as a subject, I have always condemned, and, as a prince, will severely punish. Our own vigilance, and that of our father, the patrician Ricimer, shall regulate all military affairs and provide for the safety of the Roman world, which we have saved from foreign and domestic enemies. <em><small>(<a href="nt36/038.htm">38</a>)</small></em> You now understand the maxims of my government: you may confide in the faithful love and sincere assurances of a prince who has formerly been the companion of your life and dangers, who still glories in the name of senator, and who is anxious that you should never repent of the judgment which you have pronounced in his favour." </blockquote>

<p> The emperor, who, amidst the ruins of the Roman world, revived the ancient language of law and liberty, which Trajan would not have disclaimed, must have derived those generous sentiments from his own heart, since they were not suggested to his imitation by the customs of his age or the example of his predecessors.<small>(<a href="nt36/039.htm">39</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="laws"><small class="ok">His salutary laws, A.D. 457-461.</small><br> 
The private and public actions of Majorian are very
 imperfectly known: but his laws, remarkable for an original cast of thought and expression, faithfully represent the character of a sovereign who loved his people, who sympathised in their distress, who had studied the causes of
 the decline of the empire, and who was capable of applying (as far as such reformation was practicable) judicious and effectual remedies to the public disorders. <small>(<a href="nt36/040.htm">40</a>)</small> His regulations concerning the finances manifestly tended to remove, or at least to mitigate, the most intolerable grievances. </p>
<p class="off"> <b>I.</b> From the first hour of his reign he was solicitous (I translate his own words) to relieve the <i>weary</i> fortunes of the provincials, oppressed by the accumulated weight of indictions and superindictions. <small>(<a href="nt36/041.htm">41</a>)</small> With this view, he granted an universal amnesty, a final and absolute discharge of all arrears of tribute, of all debts which, under any pretence, the fiscal officers might demand from the people. This wise dereliction of obsolete, vexatious, and unprofitable claims, improved and purified the sources of the public revenue; and the subject, who could now look back without despair, might labour with hope and gratitude for himself and for his country. </p>
<p class="off"><b>II.</b> In the assessment and collection of taxes Majorian restored the ordinary jurisdiction of the provincial magistrates, and suppressed the extraordinary commissions which had been introduced in the name of the emperor himself or of the Praetorian praefects. The favourite servants who obtained such irregular powers were insolent in their behaviour and arbitrary in their demands: they affected to despise the subordinate tribunals, and they were discontented if their fees and profits did not twice exceed the sum which they condescended to pay into the treasury. One instance of their extortion would appear incredible were it not authenticated by the legislator himself. They exacted the whole payment in gold: but they refused the current coin of the empire, and would accept only such ancient pieces as were stamped with the names of Faustina or the Antonines. The subject who was unprovided with these curious medals had recourse to the expedient of compounding with their rapacious demands; or, if he succeeded in the research, his imposition was doubled according to the weight and value of the money of former times. <small>(<a href="nt36/042.htm">42</a>)</small></p>
<p class="off"> <b>III.</b> <em class="on">"The municipal corporations </em> (says the emperor), <em class="on"> the lesser senates </em> (so antiquity has justly styled them), <em class="on"> deserve to be considered as the heart of the cities and the sinews of the republic. And yet so low are they now reduced, by the injustice of magistrates and the venality of collectors, that many of their members, renouncing their dignity and their country, have taken refuge in distant and obscure exile." </em>  He urges, and even compels, their return to their respective cities; but he removes the grievance which had forced them to desert the exercise of their municipal functions. They are directed, under the authority of the provincial magistrates, to resume their office of levying the tribute; but, instead of being made responsible for the whole sum assessed on their district, they are only required to produce a regular account of the payments which they have actually received, and of the defaulters who are still indebted to the public. </p>
<p class="off"> <b>IV.</b> But Majorian was not ignorant that these Corporate bodies were too much inclined to retaliate the injustice and oppression which they had suffered, and he therefore revives the useful office of the <I>defenders of cities</I>. He exhorts the people to elect, in a full and free assembly, some man of discretion and integrity who would dare to assert their privileges, to represent their grievances, to protect the poor from the tyranny of the rich, and to inform the emperor of the abuses that were committed under the sanction of his name and authority.
 
 </p><p id="edifices"><small class="ok">The edifices of Rome.</small><br>The spectator who casts a mournful view over the ruins of
 ancient Rome is tempted to accuse the memory of the Goths
 and Vandals for the mischief which they had neither leisure,
 nor power, nor perhaps inclination, to perpetrate. The
 tempest of war might strike some lofty turrets to the
 ground; but the destruction which undermined the foundations
 of those massy fabrics was prosecuted, slowly and silently,
 during a period of ten centuries; and the motives of
 interest, that afterwards operated without shame or control,
 were severely checked by the taste and spirit of the emperor
 Majorian. The decay of the city had gradually impaired the
 value of the public works. The circus and theatres might
 still excite, but they seldom gratified, the desires of the
 people: and the temples which had escaped the zeal of the
 Christians were no longer inhabited either by gods or men;
 the diminished crowds of the Romans were lost in the immense
 space of their baths and porticoes; and the stately
 libraries and halls of justice became useless to an indolent
 generation whose repose was seldom disturbed either by study
 or business. The monuments of consular or Imperial greatness
 were no longer revered as the immortal glory of the capital;
 they were only esteemed as an inexhaustible mine of
 materials, cheaper, and more convenient, than the distant
 quarry. Specious petitions were continually addressed to the
 easy magistrates of Rome which stated the want of stones or
 bricks for some necessary service: the fairest forms of
 architecture were rudely defaced for the sake of some paltry
 or pretended repairs; and the degenerate Romans, who
 converted the spoil to their own emolument, demolished, with
 sacrilegious hands, the labours of their ancestor. Majorian,
 who had often sighed over the desolation of the city,
 applied a severe remedy to the growing evil.<small>(<a href="nt36/043.htm">43</a>)</small> He reserved 
 to the prince and senate the sole cognisance of the extreme
 cases which might justify the destruction of an ancient
 edifice; imposed a fine of fifty pounds of gold (two
 thousand pounds sterling) on every magistrate who should
 presume to grant such illegal and scandalous licence; and
 threatened to chastise the criminal obedience of their
 subordinate officers by a severe whipping and the amputation
 of both their hands. In the last instance the legislator
 might seem to forget the proportion of guilt and punishment;
 but his zeal arose from a generous principle, and Majorian
 was anxious to protect the monuments of those ages in which
 he would have desired and deserved to live. The emperor
 conceived that it was his interest to increase the number of
 his subjects; that it was his duty to guard the purity of
 the marriage-bed: but the means which he employed to
 accomplish these salutary purposes are of an ambiguous, and
 perhaps exceptionable, kind. The pious maids who consecrated
 their virginity to Christ were restrained from taking the
 veil till they had reached their fortieth year. Widows under
 that age were compelled to form a second alliance within the
 term of five years, by the forfeiture of half their wealth
 to their nearest relations or to the state. Unequal
 marriages were condemned or annulled. The punishment of
 confiscation and exile was deemed so inadequate to the guilt
 of adultery, that, if the criminal returned to Italy, he
 might, by the express declaration of Majorian, be slain with
 impunity.<small>(<a href="nt36/044.htm">44</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="invade"><small class="ok">Majorian prepares to invade Africa, A.D. 457.</small><br>
 While the emperor Majorian assiduously laboured to restore
 the happiness and virtue of the Romans, he encountered the
 arms of Genseric, from his character and situation their
 most formidable enemy. A fleet of Vandals and Moors landed
 at the mouth of the Liris or Garigliano; but the Imperial
 troops surprised and attacked the disorderly barbarians, who
 were encumbered with the spoils of Campania, they were
 chased with slaughter to their ships, and their leader, the
 king's brother-in-law, was found in the number of the slain.
 <small>(<a href="nt36/045.htm">45</a>)</small> Such vigilance might announce the character of the new 
 reign, but the strictest vigilance and the most numerous
 forces were insufficient to protect the long-extended coast
 of Italy from the depredations of a naval war. The public
 opinion had imposed a nobler and more arduous task on the
 genius of Majorian. Rome expected from him alone the
 restitution of Africa, and the design which he formed of
 attacking the Vandals in their new settlements was the
 result of bold and judicious policy. If the intrepid emperor
 could have infused his own spirit into the youth of Italy;
 if he could have revived in the field of Mars the manly
 exercises in which he had always surpassed his equals; he
 might have marched against Genseric at the head of a <I>Roman</I>
 army. Such a reformation of national manners might be
 embraced by the rising generation; but it is the misfortune
 of those princes who laboriously sustain a declining
 monarchy, that, to obtain some immediate advantage, or to
 avert some impending danger, they are forced to countenance,
 and even to multiply, the most pernicious abuses. Majorian,
 like the weakest of his predecessors, was reduced to the
 disgraceful expedient of substituting barbarian auxiliaries
 in the place of his unwarlike subjects: and his superior
 abilities could only be displayed in the vigour and
 dexterity with which he wielded a dangerous instrument, so
 apt to recoil on the hand that used it. Besides the
 confederates who were already engaged in the service of the
 empire, the fame of his liberality and valour attracted the
 nations of the Danube, the Borysthenes, and perhaps of the
 Tanais. Many thousands of the bravest subjects of Attila,
 the Gepidae, the Ostrogoths, the Rugians, the Burgundians,
 the Suevi, the Alani, assembled in the plains of Liguria,
 and their formidable strength was balanced by their mutual
 animosities.<small>(<a href="nt36/046.htm">46</a>)</small> They passed the Alps in a severe winter. The 
 emperor led the way on foot and in complete armour, sounding
 with his long staff the depth of the ice or snow, and
 encouraging the Scythians, who complained of the extreme
 cold, by the cheerful assurance that they should be
 satisfied with the heat of Africa. The citizens of Lyons had
 presumed to shut their gates: they soon implored, and
 experienced, the clemency of Majorian. He vanquished
 Theodoric in the field, and admitted to his friendship and
 alliance a king whom he had found not unworthy of his arms.
 The beneficial though precarious reunion of the greatest
 part of Gaul and Spain was the effect of persuasion as well
 as of force;<small>(<a href="nt36/047.htm">47</a>)</small> and the independent Bagaudae, who had 
 escaped or resisted the oppression of former reigns, were
 disposed to confide in the virtues of Majorian. His camp was
 filled with barbarian allies; his throne was supported by
 the zeal of an affectionate people; but the emperor had
 foreseen that it was impossible without a maritime power to
 achieve the conquest of Africa. In the first Punic war the
 republic had exerted such incredible diligence that, within
 sixty days after the first stroke of the axe had been given
 in the forest, a fleet of one hundred and sixty galleys
 proudly rode at anchor in the sea.<small>(<a href="nt36/048.htm">48</a>)</small> Under circumstances 
 much less favourable, Majorian equalled the spirit and
 perseverance of the ancient Romans. The woods of the
 Apennine were felled, the arsenals and manufactures of
 Ravenna and Misenum were restored; Italy and Gaul vied with
 each other in liberal contributions to the public service;
 and the Imperial navy of three hundred large galleys, with
 an adequate proportion of transports and smaller vessels,
 was collected in the secure and capacious harbour of
 Carthagena in Spain.<small>(<a href="nt36/049.htm">49</a>)</small> The intrepid countenance of Majorian 
 animated his troops with a confidence of victory; and if we
 might credit the historian Procopius, his courage sometimes
 hurried him beyond the bounds of prudence. Anxious to
 explore with his own eyes the state of the Vandals, he
 ventured, after disguising the colour of his hair, to visit
 Carthage in the character of his own ambassador: and
 Genseric was afterwards mortified by the discovery that he
 had entertained and dismissed the emperor of the Romans.
 Such an anecdote may be rejected as an improbable fiction,
 but it is a fiction which would not have been imagined
 unless in the life of a hero.<small>(<a href="nt36/050.htm">50</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="fleet"><small class="ok">The loss of his fleet.</small><br>
 Without the help of a personal interview, Genseric was
 sufficiently acquainted with the genius and designs of his
 adversary. He practised his customary arts of fraud and
 delay, but he practised them without success. His
 applications for peace became each hour more submissive, and
 perhaps more sincere; but the inflexible Majorian had
 adopted the ancient maxim that Rome could not be safe as
 long as Carthage existed in a hostile state. The king of the
 Vandals distrusted the valour of his native subjects, who
 were enervated by the luxury of the South;<small>(<a href="nt36/051.htm">51</a>)</small> he suspected 
 the fidelity of the vanquished people, who abhorred him as
 an Arian tyrant; and the desperate measure which he executed
 of reducing Mauritania into a desert<small>(<a href="nt36/052.htm">52</a>)</small> could not defeat the 
 operations of the Roman emperor, who was at liberty to land
 his troops on any part of the African coast. But Genseric
 was saved from impending and inevitable ruin by the
 treachery of some powerful subjects, envious or apprehensive
 of their master's success. Guided by their secret
 intelligence, he surprised the unguarded fleet in the bay of
 Carthagena: many of the ships were sunk, or taken, or burnt;
 and the preparations of three years were destroyed in a
 single day.<small>(<a href="nt36/053.htm">53</a>)</small> After this event the behaviour of the two 
 antagonists showed them superior to their fortune. The
 Vandal, instead of being elated by this accidental victory,
 immediately renewed his solicitations for peace. The emperor
 of the West, who was capable of forming great designs and of
 supporting heavy disappointments, consented to a treaty, or
 rather to a suspension of arms, in the full assurance that
 before he could restore his navy he should be supplied with
 provocations to justify a second war. Majorian returned to
 Italy to prosecute his labours for the public happiness; and
 as he was conscious of his own integrity, he might long
 remain ignorant of the dark conspiracy which threatened his
 throne and his life. The recent misfortune of Carthagena
 sullied the glory which had dazzled the eyes of the
 multitude: almost every description of civil and military
 officers were exasperated against the Reformer, since they
 all derived some advantage from the abuses which he
 endeavoured to suppress; and the patrician Ricimer impelled
 the inconstant passions of the barbarians against a prince
 whom he esteemed and hated. The virtues of Majorian could
 not protect him from the impetuous sedition which broke out
 in the camp near Tortona at the foot of the Alps. He was
 compelled to abdicate the Imperial purple; <sup id="deathm"><I>His death, A.D. 461, August 7.</i></sup> five days after his abdication it was reported that he died of a dysentery, <small>(<a href="nt36/054.htm">54</a>)</small> and the humble tomb which covered his remains was 
 consecrated by the respect and gratitude of succeeding
 generations.<small>(<a href="nt36/055.htm">55</a>)</small> The private character of Majorian inspired love and respect. Malicious calumny and satire excited his indignation, or if he himself were the object, his contempt;
 but he protected the freedom of wit, and in the hours which
 the emperor gave to the familiar society of his friends he
 could indulge his taste for pleasantry without degrading the
 majesty of his rank.<small>(<a href="nt36/056.htm">56</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="ricimer"><small class="ok">Ricimer reigns under the name of Severus, A.D. 461-467.</small><br> 
 It was not perhaps without some regret that Ricimer
 sacrificed his friend to the interest of his ambition: but
 he resolved in a second choice to avoid the imprudent
 preference of superior virtue and merit. At his command the
 obsequious senate of Rome bestowed the Imperial title on
 Libius Severus, who ascended the throne of the West without
 emerging from the obscurity of a private condition. History
 has scarcely deigned to notice his birth, his elevation, his
 character, or his death. Severus expired as soon as his life
 became inconvenient to his patron; <small>(<a href="nt36/057.htm">57</a>)</small> and it would be 
 useless to discriminate his nominal reign in the vacant
 interval of six years between the death of Majorian and the
 elevation of Anthemius. During that period the government
 was in the hands of Ricimer alone; and although the modest
 barbarian disclaimed the name of king, he accumulated
 treasures, formed a separate army, negotiated private
 alliances, and ruled Italy with the same independent and
 despotic authority which was afterwards exercised by Odoacer
 and Theodoric But his dominions were bounded by the Alps;
 and two Roman generals, Marcellinus and Agidius, maintained
 their allegiance to the republic, by rejecting with disdain
 the phantom which he styled an emperor. <sup id="marcellinus"><I>Revolt of Marcellinus in Dalmatia</i></sup> Marcellinus still
 adhered to the old religion; and the devout Pagans, who
 secretly disobeyed the laws of the church and state,
 applauded his profound skill in the science of divination.
 But he possessed the more valuable qualifications of
 learning, virtue, and courage; <small>(<a href="nt36/058.htm">58</a>)</small> the study of the Latin 
 literature had improved his taste, and his military talents
 had recommended him to the esteem and confidence of the
 great Aetius, in whose ruin he was involved. By a timely
 flight Marcellinus escaped the rage of Valentinian, and
 boldly asserted his liberty amidst the convulsions of the
 Western empire. His voluntary or reluctant submission to the
 authority of Majorian was rewarded by the government of
 Sicily and the command of an army stationed in that island
 to oppose or to attack the Vandals; but his barbarian
 mercenaries, after the emperor's death, were tempted to
 revolt by the artful liberality of Ricimer. At the head of a
 band of faithful followers the intrepid Marcellinus occupied
 the province of Dalmatia, assumed the title of patrician of
 the West, secured the love of his subjects by a mild and
 equitable reign, built a fleet which claimed the dominion of
 the Hadriatic, and alternately alarmed the coasts of Italy
 and of Africa. <small>(<a href="nt36/059.htm">59</a>)</small> <sup id="Aegidius"><I>and of Aegidius in Gaul.</i></sup> Aegidius, the master-general of Gaul, who equalled, or at least who imitated, the heroes of ancient Rome,<small>(<a href="nt36/060.htm">60</a>)</small> proclaimed his immortal resentment against the assassins of his beloved master. A brave and numerous army was attached to his standard and though he was prevented by
 the arts of Ricimer and the arms of the Visigoths from
 marching to the gates of Rome, he maintained his independent
 sovereignty beyond the Alps and rendered the name of
 Aegidius respectable both in peace and war. The Franks, who
 had punished with exile the youthful follies of Childeric,
 elected the Roman general for their king; his vanity rather
 than his ambition was gratified by that singular honour; and
 when the nation at the end of four years repented of the
 injury which they had offered to the Merovingian family, he
 patiently acquiesced in the restoration of the lawful
 prince. The authority of Aegidius ended only with his life,
 and the suspicions of poison and secret violence, which
 derived some countenance from the character of Ricimer, were
 eagerly entertained by the passionate credulity of the
 Gauls.<small>(<a href="nt36/061.htm">61</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="vandals"><small class="ok">Naval war of the Vandals, A.D. 361-467.</small><br> 
 The kingdom of Italy, a name to which the Western empire was
 gradually reduced, was afflicted under the reign of Ricimer,
 by the incessant depredations of the Vandal pirates.<small>(<a href="nt36/062.htm">62</a>)</small> In 
 the spring of each year they equipped a formidable navy in
 the port of Carthage, and Genseric himself, though in a very
 advanced age, still commanded in person the most important
 expeditions. His designs were concealed with impenetrable
 secrecy till the moment that he hoisted sail. When he was
 asked by his pilot what course he should steer. </p>
<blockquote> "Leave the determination to the winds <em> (replied the barbarian, with pious arrogance): </em> <I>they</I> will transport us to the guilty coast whose inhabitants have provoked the divine justice";</blockquote>

<p> but if Genseric himself deigned to issue more precise orders, he judged the most wealthy to be the most criminal. The Vandals repeatedly visited the coasts of Spain, Liguria, Tuscany, Campania, Lucania, Bruttium, Apulia, Calabria, Venetia Dalmatia, Epirus, Greece, and Sicily: they were tempted to subdue the island of Sardinia, so advantageously placed in the centre of the Mediterranean; and their arms spread desolation or terror from the Columns of Hercules to the mouth of the Nile. As they were more ambitious of spoil than of glory, they seldom attacked any fortified cities, or engaged any regular troops in the open field. But the celerity of their motions enabled them almost at the same time to threaten and to attack the most distant objects which attracted their desires; and as they always embarked a sufficient number of horses, they had no sooner landed than they swept the dismayed country with a body of light cavalry. Yet, notwithstanding the example of their king, the native Vandals and Alani insensibly declined this toilsome and perilous warfare; the hardy generation of the first conquerors was almost extinguished, and their sons, who were born in Africa, enjoyed the delicious baths and gardens which had been acquired by the valour of their fathers. Their place was readily supplied by a various multitude of Moors and Romans, of captives and outlaws; and those desperate wretches, who had already violated the laws of their country, were the most eager to promote the atrocious acts which disgraced the victories of Genseric. In the treatment of his unhappy prisoners he sometimes consulted his avarice, and sometimes indulged his cruelty; and the massacre of five hundred noble citizens of Zante or Zacynthus, whose mangled bodies he cast into the Ionian Sea, was imputed by the public indignation to his latest posterity.
 
</p><p id="negotiations"><small class="ok">Negotiations with the Eastern empire, A.D. 462 etc.</small><br> 
 Such crimes could not be excused by any provocations, but
 the war which the king of the Vandals prosecuted against the
 Roman empire was justified by a specious and reasonable
 motive. The widow of Valentinian, Eudoxia, whom he had led
 captive from Rome to Carthage, was the sole heiress of the
 Theodosian house; her eldest daughter, Eudocia, became the
 reluctant wife of Hunneric, his eldest son; and the stern
 father, asserting a legal claim which could not easily be
 refuted or satisfied, demanded a just proportion of the
 Imperial patrimony. An adequate, or at least a valuable,
 compensation was offered by the Eastern emperor to purchase
 a necessary peace. Eudoxia and her younger daughter Placidia
 were honourably restored, and the fury of the Vandals was
 confined to the limits of the Western empire. The Italians,
 destitute of a naval force, which alone was capable of
 protecting their coasts, implored the aid of the more
 fortunate nations of the East, who had formerly acknowledged
 in peace and war the supremacy of Rome. But the perpetual
 division of the two empires had alienated their interest and
 their inclinations; the faith of a recent treaty was
 alleged; and the Western Romans, instead of arms and ships,
 could only obtain the assistance of a cold and ineffectual
 mediation. The haughty Ricimer, who had long struggled with
 the difficulties of his situation, was at length reduced to
 address the throne of Constantinople in the humble language
 of a subject; and Italy submitted, as the price and security
 of the alliance, to accept a master from the choice of the
 emperor of the East.<small>(<a href="nt36/063.htm">63</a>)</small> It is not the purpose of the present 
 chapter, or even of the present volume, to continue the
 distinct series of the Byzantine history; but a concise view
 of the reign and character of the emperor Leo may explain
 the last efforts that were attempted to save the falling
 empire of the West.<small>(<a href="nt36/064.htm">64</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="leo"><small class="ok">Leo, emperor of the East, A.D. 457-474.</small><br> 
 Since the death of the younger Theodosius, the domestic
 repose of Constantinople had never been interrupted by war
 or faction. Pulcheria had bestowed her hand, and the sceptre
 of the East, on the modest virtue of Marcian: he gratefully
 reverenced her august rank and virgin chastity; and, after
 her death, he gave his people the example of the religious
 worship that was due to the memory of the Imperial saint.<small>(<a href="nt36/065.htm">65</a>)</small> 
 Attentive to the prosperity of his own dominions, Marcian
 seemed to behold with indifference the misfortunes of Rome;
 and the obstinate refusal of a brave and active prince to
 draw his sword against the Vandals was ascribed to a secret
 promise which had formerly been exacted from him when he was
 a captive in the power of Genseric.<small>(<a href="nt36/066.htm">66</a>)</small> The death of Marcian, 
 after a reign of seven years, would have exposed the East to
 the danger of a popular election, if the superior weight of
 a single family had not been able to incline the balance in
 favour of the candidate whose interest they supported. The
 patrician Aspar might have placed the diadem on his own
 head, if he would have subscribed the Nicene creed.<small>(<a href="nt36/067.htm">67</a>)</small> 
 During three generations the armies of the East were
 successively commanded by his father, by himself, and by his
 son Ardaburius his barbarian guards formed a military force
 that overawed the palace and the capital; and the liberal
 distribution of his immense treasures rendered Aspar as
 popular as he was powerful. He recommended the obscure name
 of Leo of Thrace, a military tribune, and the principal
 steward of his household. His nomination was unanimously
 ratified by the senate; and the servant of Aspar received
 the Imperial crown from the hands of the patriarch or
 bishop, who was permitted to express, by this unusual
 ceremony, the suffrage of the Deity.<small>(<a href="nt36/068.htm">68</a>)</small> This emperor, the 
 first of the name of Leo, has been distinguished by the
 title of the Great, from a succession of princes who
 gradually fixed in the opinion of the Greeks a very humble
 standard of heroic, or at least of royal, perfection. Yet
 the temperate firmness with which Leo resisted the
 oppression of his benefactor showed that he was conscious of
 his duty and of his prerogative. Aspar was astonished to
 find that his influence could no longer appoint a praefect
 of Constantinople: he presumed to reproach his sovereign
 with a breach of promise, and, insolently shaking his
 purple, </p>
<blockquote> "It is not proper <em> (said he) </em>  that the man who is invested with this garment should be guilty of lying." </blockquote>

<blockquote>"Nor is it proper <em> (replied Leo) </em>  that a prince should be compelled to resign his own judgment, and the public interest, to the
 will of a subject." <em><small>(<a href="nt36/069.htm">69</a>)</small></em> </blockquote>

<p> After this extraordinary scene, it was impossible that the reconciliation of the emperor and the patrician could be sincere; or, at least, that it could be solid and permanent. An army of Isaurians<small>(<a href="nt36/070.htm">70</a>)</small> was secretly levied and introduced into Constantinople; and while Leo undermined the authority, and prepared the disgrace, of the family of Aspar, his mild and cautious behaviour restrained them from any rash and desperate attempts, which might have been fatal to themselves or their enemies. The measures of peace and war were affected by this internal revolution. As long as Aspar degraded the majesty of the throne, the secret correspondence of religion and interest engaged him to favour the cause of Genseric. When Leo had delivered himself from the ignominious servitude, he listened to the complaints of the Italians; resolved to extirpate the tyranny of the Vandals; and declared his alliance with his colleague Anthemius, whom he solemnly invested with the diadem and purple of the West.
 
</p><p id="anthemius"><small class="ok">Anthemius, emperor of the West, A.D. 467 -472.</small><br> 
 The virtues of Anthemius have perhaps been magnified, since
 the Imperial descent, which he could only deduce from the
 usurper Procopius, has been swelled into a line of emperors.
 <small>(<a href="nt36/071.htm">71</a>)</small> But the merit of his immediate parents, their honours, 
 and their riches, rendered Anthemius one of the most
 illustrious subjects of the East, His father, Procopius,
 obtained, after his Persian embassy, the rank of general and
 patrician; and the name of Anthemius was derived from his
 maternal grandfather, the celebrated praefect, who
 protected, with so much ability and success, the infant
 reign of Theodosius. The grandson of the praefect was raised
 above the condition of a private subject by his marriage
 with Euphemia, the daughter of the emperor Marcian. This
 splendid alliance, which might supersede the necessity of
 merit, hastened the promotion of Anthemius to the successive
 dignities of count, of master-general, of consul, and of
 patrician; and his merit or fortune claimed the honours of a
 victory which was obtained on the banks of the Danube over
 the Huns. Without indulging an extravagant ambition, the
 son-in-law of Marcian might hope to be his successor; but
 Anthemius supported the disappointment with courage and
 patience; and his subsequent elevation was universally
 approved by the public, who esteemed him worthy to reign
 till he ascended the throne. <small>(<a href="nt36/072.htm">72</a>)</small> The emperor of the West 
 marched from Constantinople, attended by several counts of
 high distinction and a body of guards almost equal to the
 strength and numbers of a regular army: he entered Rome in
 triumph, <small><I>A.D. 467, April 12.</i></small> and the choice of Leo was confirmed by the senate,
 the people, and the barbarian confederates of Italy.<small>(<a href="nt36/073.htm">73</a>)</small> The 
 solemn inauguration of Anthemius was followed by the
 nuptials of his daughter and the patrician Ricimer; a
 fortunate event, which was considered as the firmest
 security of the union and happiness of the state. The wealth
 of two empires was ostentatiously displayed; and many
 senators completed their ruin, by an expensive effort to
 disguise their poverty. All serious business was suspended
 during this festival; the courts of justice were shut; the
 streets of Rome, the theatres, the places of public and
 private resort, resounded with hymenaeal song and dances:
 and the royal bride, clothed in silken robes, with a crown
 on her head, was conducted to the palace of Ricimer, who had
 changed his military dress for the habit of a consul and a
 senator. On this memorable occasion, Sidonius, whose early
 ambition had been so fatally blasted, appeared as the orator
 of Auvergne, among the provincial deputies who addressed the
 throne with congratulations or complaints.<small>(<a href="nt36/074.htm">74</a>)</small> <small><I> A.D. 468, January 1st.</i></small> The calends of  January were now approaching, and the venal poet, who had
 loved Avitus and esteemed Majorian, was persuaded by his
 friends to celebrate, in heroic verse, the merit, the
 felicity, the second consulship, and the future triumphs of
 the emperor Anthemius. Sidonius pronounced, with assurance
 and success, a panegyric which is still extant; and whatever
 might be the imperfections, either of the subject or of the
 composition, the welcome flatterer was immediately rewarded
 with the praefecture of Rome; a dignity which placed him
 among the illustrious personages of the empire, till he
 wisely preferred the more respectable character of a bishop,
 and a saint.<small>(<a href="nt36/075.htm">75</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="festival"><small class="ok">Festival of the Lupercalia.</small><br> 
 The Greeks ambitiously commend the piety and catholic faith
 of the emperor whom they gave to the West; nor do they
 forget to observe that, when he left Constantinople, he
 converted his palace into the pious foundation of a public
 bath, a church, and an hospital for old men.<small>(<a href="nt36/076.htm">76</a>)</small> Yet some 
 suspicious appearances are found to sully the theological
 fame of Anthemius. From the conversation of Philotheus, a
 Macedonian sectary, he had imbibed the spirit of religious
 toleration and the heretics of Rome would have assembled
 with impunity, if the bold and vehement censure which pope
 Hilary pronounced in the church of St. Peter had not obliged
 him to abjure the unpopular indulgence.<small>(<a href="nt36/077.htm">77</a>)</small> Even the Pagans, 
 a feeble and obscure remnant, conceived some vain hopes,
 from the indifference, or partiality, of Anthemius; and his
 singular friendship for the philosopher Severus, whom he
 promoted to the consulship, was ascribed to a secret project
 of reviving the ancient worship of the gods.<small>(<a href="nt36/078.htm">78</a>)</small> These idols 
 were crumbled into dust: and the mythology which had once
 been the creed of nations was so universally disbelieved,
 that it might be employed without scandal, or at least
 without suspicion, by Christian poets.<small>(<a href="nt36/079.htm">79</a>)</small> Yet the vestiges 
 of superstition were not absolutely obliterated, and the
 festival of the Lupercalia, whose origin had preceded the
 foundation of Rome, was still celebrated under the reign of
 Anthemius. The savage and simple rites were expressive of an
 early state of society before the invention of arts and
 agriculture. The rustic deities who presided over the toils
 and pleasures of the pastoral life, Pan, Faunus, and their
 train of satyrs, were such as the fancy of shepherds might
 create, sportive, petulant, and lascivious; whose power was
 limited, and whose malice was inoffensive. A goat was the
 offering the best adapted to their character and attributes;
 the flesh of the victim was roasted on willow spits; and the
 riotous youths, who crowded to the feast, ran naked about
 the fields, with leather thongs in their hands,
 communicating, as it was supposed, the blessing of fecundity
 to the women whom they touched. <small>(<a href="nt36/080.htm">80</a>)</small> The altar of Pan was 
 erected, perhaps by Evander the Arcadian, in a dark recess
 in the side of the Palatine hill, watered by a perpetual
 fountain, and shaded by a hanging grove. A tradition that,
 in the same place, Romulus and Remus were suckled by the
 wolf, rendered it still more sacred and venerable in the
 eyes of the Romans; and this sylvan spot was gradually
 surrounded by the stately edifices of the Forum.<small>(<a href="nt36/081.htm">81</a>)</small> After 
 the conversion of the Imperial city, the Christians still
 continued, in the month of February, the annual celebration
 of the Lupercalia; to which they ascribed a secret and
 mysterious influence on the genial powers of the animal and
 vegetable world. The bishops of Rome were solicitous to
 abolish a profane custom so repugnant to the spirit of
 Christianity; but their zeal was not supported by the
 authority of the civil magistrate: the inveterate abuse
 subsisted till the end of the fifth century, and pope
 Gelasius, who purified the capital from the last stain of
 idolatry, appeased, by a formal apology, the murmurs of the
 senate and people.<small>(<a href="nt36/082.htm">82</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="preparations"><small class="ok">Preparations against the Vandals of Africa, A.D. 468.</small><br> 
 In all his public declarations the emperor Leo assumes the
 authority, and professes the affection of a father for his
 son Anthemius, with whom he had divided the administration
 of the universe. <small>(<a href="nt36/083.htm">83</a>)</small> The situation, and perhaps the 
 character, of Leo dissuaded him from exposing his person to
 the toils and dangers of an African war. But the powers of
 the Eastern empire were strenuously exerted to deliver Italy
 and the Mediterranean from the Vandals; and Genseric, who
 had so long oppressed both the land and sea, was threatened
 from every side with a formidable invasion. The campaign was
 opened by a bold and successful enterprise of the praefect
 Heraclius.<small>(<a href="nt36/084.htm">84</a>)</small> The troops of Egypt, Thebais, and Libya were 
 embarked under this command and the Arabs, with a train of
 horses and camels opened the roads of the desert. Heraclius
 landed on the coast of Tripoli, surprised and subdued the
 cities of that province, and prepared, by a laborious march,
 which Cato had formerly executed, <small>(<a href="nt36/085.htm">85</a>)</small> to join the Imperial 
 army under the walls of Carthage. The intelligence of this
 loss extorted from Genseric some insidious and in. effectual
 propositions of peace: but he was still more seriously
 alarmed by the reconciliation of Marcellinus with the two
 empires. The independent patrician had been persuaded to
 acknowledge the legitimate title of Anthemius whom he
 accompanied in his journey to Rome, the Dalmatian fleet was
 received into the harbours of Italy; the active valour of
 Marcellinus expelled the Vandals from the island of
 Sardinia; and the languid efforts of the West added some
 weight to the immense preparations of the Eastern Romans.
 The expense of the naval armament, which Leo sent against
 the Vandals has been distinctly ascertained; and the curious
 and instructive account displays the wealth of the declining
 empire. The Royal demesnes, or private patrimony of the
 prince, supplied seventeen thousand pounds of gold;
 forty-seven thousand pounds of gold, and seven hundred
 thousand of silver, were levied and paid into the treasury
 by the Praetorian praefects. But the cities were reduced to
 extreme poverty; and the diligent calculation of fines and
 forfeitures, as a valuable object of the revenue, does not
 suggest the idea of a just, or merciful, administration. The
 whole expense, by whatsoever means it was defrayed, of the
 African campaign, amounted to the sum of one hundred and
 thirty thousand pounds of gold, about five millions two
 hundred thousand pounds sterling, at a time when the value
 of money appears, from the comparative price of corn, to
 have been somewhat higher than in the present age.<small>(<a href="nt36/086.htm">86</a>)</small> The 
 fleet that sailed from Constantinople to Carthage consisted
 of eleven hundred and thirteen ships, and the number of
 soldiers and mariners exceeded one hundred thousand men.
 Basiliscus, the brother of the empress Verina, was intrusted
 with this important command. His sister, the wife of Leo,
 had exaggerated the merit of his former exploits against the
 Scythians. But the discovery of his guilt, or incapacity,
 was reserved for the African war; and his friends could only
 save his military reputation by asserting that he had
 conspired with Aspar to spare Genseric, and to betray the
 last hope of the Western empire.
 
</p><p id="failure"><small class="ok">Failure of the expedition.</small><br> 
 Experience has shewn that the success of an invader most
 commonly depends on the vigour and celerity of his
 operations. The strength and sharpness of the first
 impression are blunted by delay; the health and spirit of
 the troops insensibly languish in a distant climate; the
 naval and military force, a mighty effort which perhaps can
 never be repeated, is silently consumed, and every hour that
 is wasted in negotiation accustoms the enemy to contemplate
 and examine those hostile terrors which, on their first
 appearance, he deemed irresistible. The formidable navy of
 Basiliscus pursued its prosperous navigation from the
 Thracian Bosphorus to the coast of Africa. He landed his
 troops at Cape Bona, or the promontory of Mercury, about
 forty miles from Carthage.<small>(<a href="nt36/087.htm">87</a>)</small> The army of Heraclius, and the 
 fleet of Marcellinus, either joined or seconded the Imperial
 lieutenant; and the Vandals who opposed his progress by sea
 or land were successively vanquished.<small>(<a href="nt36/088.htm">88</a>)</small> If Basiliscus had 
 seized the moment of consternation, and boldly advanced to
 the capital, Carthage must have surrendered, and the kingdom
 of the Vandals was extinguished. Genseric beheld the danger
 with firmness, and eluded it with his veteran dexterity. He
 protested, in the most respectful language, that he was
 ready to submit his person and his dominions to the will of
 the emperor; but he requested a truce of five days to
 regulate the terms of his submission; and it was universally
 believed that his secret liberality contributed to the
 success of this public negotiation Instead of obstinately
 refusing whatever indulgence his enemy so earnestly
 solicited, the guilty, or the credulous, Basiliscus
 consented to the fatal truce; and his imprudent security
 seemed to proclaim that he already considered himself as the
 conqueror of Africa. During this short interval the wind
 became favourable to the designs of Genseric. He manned his
 largest ships of war with the bravest of the Moors and
 Vandals; and they towed after them many large barks filled
 with combustible materials. In the obscurity of the night,
 these destructive vessels were impelled against the
 unguarded and unsuspecting fleet of the Romans, who were
 awakened by the sense of their instant danger. Their close
 and crowded order assisted the progress of the fire, which
 was communicated with rapid and irresistible violence; and
 the noise of the wind, the crackling of the flames the
 dissonant cries of the soldiers and mariners, who could
 neither command nor obey, increased the horror of the
 nocturnal tumult. Whilst they laboured to extricate
 themselves from the fire-ships, and to save at least a part
 of the navy, the galleys of Genseric assaulted them with
 temperate and disciplined valour; and many of the Romans,
 who escaped the fury of the flames, were destroyed or taken
 by the victorious Vandals. Among the events of that
 disastrous night, the heroic, or rather desperate, courage
 of John, one of the principal officers of Basiliscus, has
 rescued his name from oblivion. When the ship which he had
 bravely defended was almost consumed, he threw himself in
 his armour into the sea, disdainfully rejected the esteem
 and pity of Genso, the son of Genseric, who pressed him to
 accept honourable quarter, and sunk under the waves;
 exclaiming, with his last breath, that he would never fall
 alive into the hands of those impious dogs. Actuated by a
 far different spirit, Basiliscus, whose station was the most
 remote from danger, disgracefully fled in the beginning of
 the engagement, returned to Constantinople with the loss of
 more than half of his fleet and army, and sheltered his
 guilty head in the sanctuary of St. Sophia, till his sister,
 by her tears and entreaties, could obtain his pardon from
 the indignant emperor. Heraclius effected his retreat
 through the desert; Marcellinus retired to Sicily, where he
 was assassinated, perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer, by
 one of his own captains; and the king of the Vandals
 expressed his surprise and satisfaction that the Romans
 themselves should remove from the world his most formidable
 antagonists.<small>(<a href="nt36/089.htm">89</a>)</small> After the failure of this great expedition, 
 Genseric again became the tyrant of the sea: the coasts of
 Italy, Greece, and Asia, were again exposed to his revenge
 and avarice; Tripoli and Sardinia returned to his obedience;
 he added Sicily to the number of his provinces; and, before
 he died, in the fulness of years and of glory, he beheld the
<small><I>A.D. 477.</i></small> final extinction of the empire of the West.<small>(<a href="nt36/090.htm">90</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="conquests"><small class="ok">Conquests of the Visigoths in Spain and Gaul, A.D. 462-472.</small><br> 
During his long and active reign the African monarch had
 studiously cultivated the friendship of the barbarians of
 Europe, whose arms he might employ in a seasonable and
 effectual diversion against the two empires. After the death
 of Attila he renewed his alliance with the Visigoths of
 Gaul; and the sons of the elder Theodoric, who successively
 reigned over that warlike nation, were easily persuaded, by
 the sense of interest, to forget the cruel affront which
 Genseric had inflicted on their sister.<small>(<a href="nt36/091.htm">91</a>)</small> The death of the 
 emperor Majorian delivered Theodoric the Second from the
 restraint of fear, and perhaps of honour; he violated his
 recent treaty with the Romans; and the ample territory of
 Narbonne, which he firmly united to his dominions, became
 the immediate reward of his perfidy. The selfish policy of
 Ricimer encouraged him to invade the provinces which were in
 the possession of Aegidius, his rival; but the active count,
 by the defence of Arles and the victory of Orleans, saved
 Gaul, and checked during his lifetime the progress of the
 Visigoths. Their ambition was soon rekindled; and the design
 of extinguishing the Roman empire in Spain and Gaul was
 conceived and almost completed in the reign of Euric, who
 assassinated his brother Theodoric, and displayed, with a
 more savage temper, superior abilities both in peace and
 war. He passed the Pyrenees at the head of a numerous army,
 subdued the cities of Saragossa and Pampeluna, vanquished in
 battle the martial nobles of the Tarragonese province,
 carried his victorious arms into the heart of Lusitania, and
 permitted the Suevi to hold the kingdom of Gallicia under
 the Gothic monarchy of Spain.<small>(<a href="nt36/092.htm">92</a>)</small> The efforts of Euric were 
 not less vigorous or less successful in Gaul; and throughout
 the country that extends from the Pyrenees to the Rhone and
 the Loire, Berry and Auvergne were the only cities or
 dioceses which refused to acknowledge him as their master.
 <small>(<a href="nt36/093.htm">93</a>)</small> In the defence of Clermont, their principal town, the 
 inhabitants of Auvergne sustained with inflexible resolution
 the miseries of war, pestilence, and famine; and the
 Visigoths, relinquishing the fruitless siege, suspended the
 hopes of that important conquest. The youth of the province
 were animated by the heroic and almost incredible valour of
 Ecdicius, the son of the emperor Avitus, <small>(<a href="nt36/094.htm">94</a>)</small> who made a 
 desperate sally with only eighteen horsemen, boldly attacked
 the Gothic army, and, after maintaining a flying skirmish,
 retired safe and victorious within the walls of Clermont.
 His charity was equal to his courage: in a time of extreme
 scarcity four thousand poor were fed at his expense; and his
 private influence levied an army of Burgundians for the
 deliverance of Auvergne. From his virtues alone the faithful
 citizens of Gaul derived any hopes of safety or freedom; and
 even such virtues were insufficient to avert the impending
 ruin of their country, since they were anxious to learn,
 from his authority and example, whether they should prefer
 the alternative of exile or servitude. <small>(<a href="nt36/095.htm">95</a>)</small> The public 
 confidence was lost; the resources of the state were
 exhausted; and the Gauls had too much reason to believe that
 Anthemius, who reigned in Italy, was incapable of protecting
 his distressed subjects beyond the Alps. The feeble emperor
 could only procure for their defence the service of twelve
 thousand British auxiliaries. Riothamus, one of the
 independent kings or chieftains of the island, was persuaded
 to transport his troops to the continent of Gaul: he sailed
 up the Loire and established his quarters in Berry, where
 the people complained of these oppressive allies, till they
 were destroyed or dispersed by the arms of the Visigoths.<small>(<a href="nt36/096.htm">96</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="trial"><small class="ok">Trial of Arvandus, A.D. 468.</small><br> 
 One of the last acts of jurisdiction which the Roman senate
 exercised over their subjects of Gaul was the trial and
 condemnation of Arvandus, the Praetorian praefect. Sidonius,
 who rejoices that he lived under a reign in which he might
 pity and assist a state-criminal, has expressed, with
 tenderness and freedom, the faults of his indiscreet and
 unfortunate friend.<small>(<a href="nt36/097.htm">97</a>)</small> From the perils which he had escaped, 
 Arvandus imbibed confidence rather than wisdom; and such was
 the various, though uniform, imprudence of his behaviour,
 that his prosperity must appear much more surprising than
 his downfall. The second praefecture, which he obtained
 within the term of five years, abolished the merit and
 popularity of his preceding administration. His easy temper
 was corrupted by flattery and exasperated by opposition; he
 was forced to satisfy his importunate creditors with the
 spoils of the province; his capricious insolence offended
 the nobles of Gaul; and he sunk under the weight of the
 public hatred. The mandate of his disgrace summoned him to
 justify his conduct before the senate; and he passed the sea
 of Tuscany with a favourable wind, the presage, as he vainly
 imagined, of his future fortunes. A decent respect was still
 observed for the <I>Praefectorian</I> rank; and on his arrival at
 Rome Arvandus was committed to the hospitality, rather than
 to the custody, of Flavius Asellus, the count of the sacred
 largesses, who resided in the Capitol. <small>(<a href="nt36/098.htm">98</a>)</small> He was eagerly 
 pursued by his accusers, the four deputies of Gaul, who were
 all distinguished by their birth, their dignities, or their
 eloquence. In the name of a great province, and according to
 the forms of Roman jurisprudence, they instituted a civil
 and criminal action, requiring such restitution as might
 compensate the losses of individuals, and such punishment as
 might satisfy the justice of the state. Their charges of
 corrupt oppression were numerous and weighty; but they
 placed their secret dependence on a letter which they had
 intercepted, and which they could prove, by the evidence of
 his secretary, to have been dictated by Arvandus himself.
 The author of this letter seemed to dissuade the king of the
 Goths from a peace with the <I>Greek</I> emperor: he suggested the
 attack of the Britons on the Loire and he recommended a
 division of Gaul, according to the law of nations, between
 the Visigoths and the Burgundians. <small>(<a href="nt36/099.htm">99</a>)</small> These pernicious 
 schemes, which a friend could only palliate by the
 reproaches of vanity and indiscretion, were susceptible of a
 treasonable interpretation; and the deputies had artfully
 resolved not to produce their most formidable weapons till
 the decisive moment of the contest. But their intentions
 were discovered by the zeal of Sidonius. He immediately
 apprised the unsuspecting criminal of his danger; and
 sincerely lamented, without any mixture of anger, the
 haughty presumption of Arvandus, who rejected, and even
 resented, the salutary advice of his friends. Ignorant of
 his real situation, Arvandus showed himself in the Capitol
 in the white robe of a candidate, accepted indiscriminate
 salutations and offers of service, examined the shops of the
 merchants, the silks, and gems, sometimes with the
 indifference of a spectator and sometimes with the attention
 of a purchaser; and complained of the times, of the senate,
 of the prince, and of the delays of justice. His complaints
 were soon removed. An early day was fixed for his trial; and
 Arvandus appeared, with his accusers, before a numerous
 assembly of the Roman senate. The mournful garb which they
 affected excited the compassion of the judges, who were
 scandalised by the gay and splendid dress of their
 adversary: and when the praefect Arvandus, with the first of
 the Gallic deputies, were directed to take their places on
 the senatorial benches, the same contrast of pride and
 modesty was observed in their behaviour. In this memorable
 judgment, which presented a lively image of the old
 republic, the Gauls exposed, with force and freedom, the
 grievances of the province; and as soon as the minds of the
 audience were sufficiently inflamed, they recited the fatal
 epistle. The obstinacy of Arvandus was founded on the
 strange supposition that a subject could not be convicted of
 treason, unless he had actually conspired to assume the
 purple. As the paper was read, he repeatedly, and with a
 loud voice, acknowledged it for his genuine composition; and
 his astonishment was equal to his dismay when the unanimous
 voice of the senate declared him guilty of a capital
 offence. By their decree he was degraded from the rank of a
 praefect to the obscure condition of a plebeian, and
 ignominiously dragged by servile hands to the public Prison.
 After a fortnight's adjournment the senate was again
 convened to pronounce the sentence of his death: but while
 he expected, in the island of Alsculapius, the expiration of
 the thirty days allowed by an ancient law to the vilest
 malefactors, <small>(<a href="nt36/100.htm">100</a>)</small> his friends interposed, the emperor 
 Anthemius relented, and the praefect of Gaul obtained the
 milder punishment of exile and confiscation. The faults of
 Arvandus might deserve compassion; but the impunity of
 Seronatus accused the justice of the republic, till he was
 condemned and executed on the complaint of the people of
 Auvergne. That flagitious minister, the Catiline of his age
 and country, held a secret correspondence with the Visigoths
 to betray the province which he oppressed: his industry was
 continually exercised in the discovery of new taxes and
 obsolete offences; and his extravagant vices would have
 inspired contempt if they had not excited fear and
 abhorrence.<small>(<a href="nt36/101.htm">101</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="discord"><small class="ok">Discord of Anthemius and Ricimer, A.D. 471.</small><br> 
 Such criminals were not beyond the reach of justice; but
 whatever might be the guilt of Ricimer, that powerful
 barbarian was able to contend or to negotiate with the
 prince whose alliance he had condescended to accept. The
 peaceful and prosperous reign which Anthemius had promised
 to the West was soon clouded by misfortune and discord.
 Ricimer, apprehensive or impatient of a superior, retired
 from Rome and fixed his residence at Milan; an advantageous
 situation, either to invite or to repel the warlike tribes
 that were seated between the Alps and the Danube.<small>(<a href="nt36/102.htm">102</a>)</small> Italy 
 was gradually divided into two independent and hostile
 kingdoms; and the nobles of Liguria, who trembled at the
 near approach of a civil war, fell prostrate at the feet of
 the patrician, and conjured him to spare their unhappy
 country. </p>
<blockquote> "For my own part," <em>replied Ricimer, in a tone of
 insolent moderation, </em>  "I am still inclined to embrace the friendship of the Galatian; <em><small>(<a href="nt36/103.htm">103</a>)</small></em>  but who will undertake to appease his anger, or to mitigate the pride which always rises in proportion to our submission?" </blockquote>

<p>They informed him that Epiphanius, bishop of Pavia,<small>(<a href="nt36/104.htm">104</a>)</small> united the wisdom of  the serpent with the innocence of the dove; and appeared confident that the eloquence of such an ambassador must prevail against the strongest opposition, either of interest or passion. Their recommendation was approved; and Epiphanius, assuming the benevolent office of mediation, proceeded without delay to Rome where he was received with the honours due to his merit and reputation. The oration of a bishop in favour of peace may be easily supposed: he argued that, in all possible circumstances, the forgiveness of injuries must be an act of mercy, or magnanimity, or prudence; and he seriously admonished the emperor to avoid a contest with a fierce barbarian, which might be fatal to himself, and must be ruinous to his dominions. Anthemius acknowledged the truth of his maxims; but he deeply felt, with grief and indignation, the behaviour of Ricimer; and his passion gave eloquence and energy to his discourse. </p>
<blockquote>"What favours," <em>he warmly exclaimed, </em> "have we refused to this ungrateful man? What provocations have we not endured? Regardless of the majesty of the purple, I gave my daughter to a Goth; I sacrificed my own blood to the safety of the republic. The liberality which ought to have secured the eternal attachment of Ricimer has exasperated him against his benefactor. What wars has he not excited against the empire? How often has he instigated and assisted the fury of hostile nations? Shall I now accept his perfidious friendship? Can I hope that <I>he</I> will respect the engagements of a treaty, who has already violated the duties of a son?" </blockquote>

<p> But the anger of Anthemius evaporated in these passionate exclamations: he insensibly yielded to the proposals of Epiphanius; and the bishop returned to his diocese with the satisfaction of restoring the peace of Italy by a reconciliation,<small>(<a href="nt36/105.htm">105</a>)</small> of which the sincerity and continuance might be reasonably suspected. The clemency of the emperor was extorted from his weakness; and Ricimer suspended his ambitious designs till he had secretly prepared the engines with which he resolved to subvert the throne of Anthemius. The mask of peace and moderation was then thrown aside. The army of Ricimer was fortified by a numerous reinforcement of Burgundians and Oriental Suevi: he disclaimed all allegiance to the Greek emperor, marched from Milan to the gates of Rome, and, fixing his camp on the banks of the Anio, impatiently expected the arrival of Olybrius, his Imperial candidate.
 
</p><p id="olybrius"><small class="ok">Olybrius emperor of the West, A.D. 472, March 23.</small><br> 
 The senator Olybrius, of the Anician family, might esteem
 himself the lawful heir of the Western empire. He had
 married Placidia, the younger daughter of Valentinian, after
 she was restored by Genseric, who still detained her sister
 Eudoxia, as the wife, or rather as the captive, of his son.
 The king of the Vandals supported, by threats and
 solicitations, the fair pretensions of his Roman ally, and
 assigned, as one of the motives of the war, the refusal of
 the senate and people to acknowledge their lawful prince,
 and the unworthy preference which they had given to a
 stranger.<small>(<a href="nt36/106.htm">106</a>)</small> The friendship of the public enemy might 
 render Olybrius still more unpopular to the Italians; but
 when Ricimer meditated the ruin of the emperor Anthemius, he
 tempted, with the offer of a diadem the candidate who could
 justify his rebellion by an illustrious name and a royal
 alliance. The husband of Placidia, who, like most of his
 ancestors, had been invested with the consular dignity,
 might have continued to enjoy a secure and splendid fortune
 in the peaceful residence of Constantinople; nor does he
 appear to have been tormented by such a genius as cannot be
 amused or occupied unless by the administration of an
 empire. Yet Olybrius yielded to the importunities of his
 friends, perhaps of his wife; rashly plunged into the
 dangers and calamities of a civil war; and, with the secret
 connivance of the emperor Leo, accepted the Italian purple,
 which was bestowed, and resumed, at the capricious will of a
 barbarian. He landed without obstacle (for Genseric was
 master of the sea) either at Ravenna or the port of Ostia,
 and immediately proceeded to the camp of Ricimer, where he
 was received as the sovereign of the Western world.<small>(<a href="nt36/107.htm">107</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="deatha"><small class="ok">Sack of Rome and death of Anthemius, A.D. 472, July 11.</small><br> 
 The patrician, who had extended his posts from the Anio to
 the Milvian bridge, already possessed two quarters of Rome,
 the Vatican and the Faniculum, which are separated by the
 Tiber from the rest of the city; <small>(<a href="nt36/108.htm">108</a>)</small> and it may be 
 conjectured that an assembly of seceding senators imitated,
 in the choice of Olybrius, the forms of a legal election.
 But the body of the senate and people firmly adhered to the
 cause of Anthemius; and the more effectual support of a
 Gothic army enabled him to prolong his reign, and the public
 distress, by a resistance of three months, which produced
 the concomitant evils of famine and pestilence. At length
 Ricimer made a furious assault on the bridge of Hadrian, or
 St. Angelo; and the narrow pass was defended with equal
 valour by the Goths till the death of Gilimer, their leader.
 The victorious troops, breaking down every barrier, rushed
 with irresistible violence into the heart of the city, and
 Rome (if we may use the language of a contemporary pope) was
 subverted by the civil fury of Anthemius and Ricimer.<small>(<a href="nt36/109.htm">109</a>)</small> 
 The unfortunate Anthemius was dragged from his concealment
 and inhumanly massacred by the command of his son-in-law,
 who thus added a third, or perhaps a fourth, emperor to the
 number of his victims. The soldiers, who united the rage of
 factious citizens with the savage manners of barbarians,
 were indulged without control in the licence of rapine and
 murder: the crowd of slaves and plebeians, who were
 unconcerned in the event, could only gain by the
 indiscriminate pillage; and the face of the city exhibited
 the strange contrast of stern cruelty and dissolute
 intemperance.<small>(<a href="nt36/110.htm">110</a>)</small> <sup id="deathr"><I>Death of Ricimer, August 20.</i></sup>  Forty days after this calamitous event, the subject, not of glory, but of guilt, Italy was
 delivered, by a painful disease, from the tyrant Ricimer, who bequeathed the command of his army to his nephew Gundobald, one of the princes of the Burgundians. In the same year all the principal actors in this great revolution were removed from the stage; and the whole reign of Olybrius, <sup id="deatho"><I>and of Olybrius, October 23.</i></sup>  whose death does not betray any symptoms of violence, is included within the term of seven months. He left one daughter, the off-spring of his marriage with Placidia; and the family of the great Theodosius, transplanted from Spain to Constantinople, was propagated in the female line as far as the eighth generation.<small>(<a href="nt36/111.htm">111</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="julius"><small class="ok">Julius Nepos and Glycerius emperors of the West, A.D. 472-475 .</small><br> 
Whilst the vacant throne of Italy was abandoned to lawless
 barbarians, <small>(<a href="nt36/112.htm">112</a>)</small> the election of a new colleague was 
 seriously agitated in the council of Leo. The empress
 Verina, studious to promote the greatness of her own family,
 had married one of her nieces to Julius Nepos, who succeeded
 his uncle Marcellinus in the sovereignty of Dalmatia, a more
 solid possession than the title which he was persuaded to
 accept of Emperor of the West. But the measures of the
 Byzantine court were so languid and irresolute, that many
 months elapsed after the death of Anthemius, and even of
 Olybrius, before their destined successor could show
 himself, with a respectable force, to his Italian subjects.
 During that interval, Glycerius, an obscure soldier, was
 invested with the purple by his patron Guniobald; but the
 Burgundian prince was unable or unwilling to support his
 nomination by a civil war: the pursuits of domestic ambition
 recalled him beyond the Alps, <small>(<a href="nt36/113.htm">113</a>)</small> and his client was 
 permitted to exchange the Roman sceptre for the bishopric of
 Salona. After extinguishing such a competitor, the emperor
 Nepos was acknowledged by the senate, by the Italians, and
 by the provincials of Gaul; his moral virtues and military
 talents were loudly celebrated, and those who derived any
 private benefit from his government announced in prophetic
 strains the restoration of the public felicity.<small>(<a href="nt36/114.htm">114</a>)</small> Their 
 hopes ( if such hopes had been entertained) were confounded
 within the term of a single year, and the treaty of peace,
 which ceded Auvergne to the Visigoths, is the only event of
 his short and inglorious reign. The most faithful subjects
 of Gaul were sacrificed by the Italian emperor to he hope of
 domestic security;<small>(<a href="nt36/115.htm">115</a>)</small> but his repose was soon invaded by a 
 furious sedition of the barbarian <I>confederates</I>, who, under
 the command of Orestes, their general, were in full march
 from Rome to Ravenna. Nepos trembled at their approach; and,
 instead of placing a just confidence in the strength of
 Ravenna, he hastily escaped to his ships, and retired to his
 Dalmatian principality, on the opposite coast of the
 Hadriatic. By this shameful abdication he protracted his
 life about five years, in a very ambiguous state between an
 emperor and an exile, till he was assassinated at Salona by
 the ungrateful Glycerius, who was translated, perhaps as the
 reward of his crime, to the archbishopric of Milan.<small>(<a href="nt36/116.htm">116</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="orestes"><small class="ok">The patrician Orestes, A.D. 475.</small><br> 
 The nations who had asserted their independence after the
 death of Attila were established, by the right of possession
 or conquest, in the boundless countries to the north of the
 Danube; or in the Roman provinces between the river and the
 Alps. But the bravest of their youth enlisted in the army of
 confederates, who formed the defence and the terror of
 Italy;<small>(<a href="nt36/117.htm">117</a>)</small> and in this promiscuous multitude, the names of 
 the Heruli, the Sciri, the Alani, the Turcilingi, and the
 Rugians, appear to have predominated. The example of these
 warriors was imitated by Orestes,<small>(<a href="nt36/118.htm">118</a>)</small> the son of Tatullus, 
 and the father of the last Roman emperor of the West.
 Orestes, who has been already mentioned in this history, had
 never deserted his country. His birth and fortunes rendered
 him one of the most illustrious subjects of Pannonia. When
 that province was ceded to the Huns, he entered into the
 service of Attila, his lawful sovereign, obtained the office
 of his secretary, and was repeatedly sent ambassador to
 Constantinople, to represent the person and signify the
 commands of the imperious monarch. The death of that
 conqueror restored him to his freedom; and Orestes might
 honourably refuse either to follow the sons of Attila into
 the Scythian desert, or to obey the Ostrogoths, who had
 usurped the dominion of Pannonia. He preferred the service
 of the Italian princes, the successors of Valentinian; and,
 as he possessed the qualifications of courage, industry, and
 experience, he advanced with rapid steps in the military
 profession, till he was elevated, by the favour of Nepos
 himself, to the dignities of patrician and master-general of
 the troops. These troops had been long accustomed to
 reverence the character and authority of Orestes, who
 affected their manners, conversed with them in their own
 language, and was intimately connected with their national
 chieftains by long habits of familiarity and friendship. At
 his solicitation they rose in arms against the obscure Greek
 who presumed to claim their obedience; and when Orestes,
 from some secret motive, declined the purple, they
 consented, with the same facility, <sup id="augustulus"><I>His son Augustulus, the last emperor of the West, A.D. 476</i></sup>  to acknowledge his son Augustulus as the emperor of the West. By the abdication of Nepos, Orestes had now attained the summit of his ambitious
 hopes; but he soon discovered, before the end of the first
 year, that the lessons of perjury and ingratitude which a
 rebel must inculcate will be retorted against himself, and
 that the precarious sovereign of Italy was only permitted to
 choose whether he would be the slave or the victim of his
 barbarian mercenaries. The dangerous alliance of these
 strangers had oppressed and insulted the last remains of
 Roman freedom and dignity. At each revolution their pay and
 privileges were augmented; but their insolence increased in
 a still more extravagant degree; they envied the fortune of
 their brethren in Gaul, Spain, and Africa, whose victorious
 arms had acquired an independent and perpetual inheritance;
 and they insisted on their peremptory demand that a <I>third</I>
 part of the lands of Italy should be immediately divided
 among them. Orestes, with a spirit which, in another
 situation, might be entitled to our esteem, chose rather to
 encounter the rage of an armed multitude than to subscribe
 the ruin of an innocent people. He rejected the audacious
 demand; and his refusal was favourable to the ambition of
 Odoacer, a bold barbarian, who assured his fellow-soldiers
 that, if they dared to associate under his command, they
 might soon extort the justice which had been denied to their
 dutiful petitions. From all the camps and garrisons of Italy
 the confederates, actuated by the same resentment and the
 same hopes, impatiently flocked to the standard of this
 popular leader; and the unfortunate patrician, overwhelmed
 by the torrent, hastily retreated to the strong city of
 Pavia, the episcopal seat of the holy Epiphanites. Pavia was
 immediately besieged, the fortifications were stormed, the
 town was pillaged; and although the bishop might labour,
 with much zeal and some success, to save the property of the
 church and the chastity of female captives, the tumult could
 only be appeased by the execution of Orestes. <small>(<a href="nt36/119.htm">119</a>)</small> His 
 brother Paul was slain in an action near Ravenna; and the
 helpless Augustulus, who could no longer command the
 respect, was reduced to implore the clemency, of Odoacer.
 
</p><p id="odoacer"><small class="ok">Odoacer king of Italy, A.D. 476-490.</small><br> 
 That successful barbarian was the son of Edecon; who, in
 some remarkable transactions, particularly described in a
 preceding chapter had been the colleague of Orestes himself.
 The honour of an ambassador should be exempt from suspicion;
 and Edecon had listened to a conspiracy against the life of
 his sovereign. But this apparent guilt was expiated by his
 merit or repentance: his rank was eminent and conspicuous;
 he enjoyed the favour of Attila; and the troops under his
 command, who guarded in their turn the royal village,
 consisted of a tribe of Sciri, his immediate and hereditary
 subjects. In the revolt of the nations they still adhered to
 the Huns; and, more than twelve years afterwards, the name
 of Edecon is honourably mentioned in their unequal contest
 with the Ostrogoths; which was terminated, after two bloody
 battles, by the defeat and dispersion of the Sciri.<small>(<a href="nt36/120.htm">120</a>)</small> 
 Their gallant leader, who did not survive this national
 calamity, left two sons, Onulf and Odoacer, to struggle with
 adversity, and to maintain as they might, by rapine or
 service, the faithful followers of their exile. Onulf
 directed his steps towards Constantinople, where he sullied,
 by the assassination of a generous benefactor, the fame
 which he had acquired in arms. His brother Odoacer led a
 wandering life among the barbarians of Noricum, with a mind
 and a fortune suited to the most desperate adventures; and
 when he had fixed his choice, he piously visited the cell of
 Severinus, the popular saint of the country, to solicit his
 approbation and blessing. The lowness of the door would not
 admit the lofty stature of Odoacer: he was obliged to stoop;
 but in that humble attitude the saint could discern the
 symptoms of his future greatness; and addressing him in a
 prophetic tone, </p>
<blockquote> "Pursue <em> (said he) </em> your design; proceed to Italy, you will soon cast away this coarse garment of skins; and your wealth will be adequate to the liberality of your mind." <em><small>(<a href="nt36/121.htm">121</a>)</small></em> </blockquote>

<p> The barbarian, whose daring spirit accepted and ratified the prediction, was admitted into the service of the Western empire, and soon obtained an honourable rank in the guards. His manners were gradually polished, his military skill was improved, and the confederates of Italy would not have elected him for their general unless the exploits of Odoacer had established a high opinion of his courage and capacity. <small>(<a href="nt36/122.htm">122</a>)</small> Their military acclamations saluted him with the title of king, but he abstained during his whole reign from the use of the purple and diadem,<small>(<a href="nt36/123.htm">123</a>)</small>  lest he should offend those princes whose subjects, by their accidental mixture, had formed the victorious army which time and policy might insensibly unite into a great nation.
 
</p><p id="extinction"><small class="ok">Extinction of the Western empire, A.D. 476 or 479.</small><br> 
 Royalty was familiar to the barbarians, and the submissive
 people of Italy was prepared to obey, without a murmur, the
 authority which he should condescend to exercise as the
 vicegerent of the emperor of the West. But Odoacer had
 resolved to abolish that useless and expensive office; and
 such is the weight of antique prejudice, that it required
 some boldness and penetration to discover the extreme
 facility of the enterprise. The unfortunate Augustulus was
 made the instrument of his own disgrace; he signified his
 resignation to the senate; and that assembly, in their last
 act of obedience to a Roman prince, still affected the
 spirit of freedom and the forms of the constitution. An
 epistle was addressed, by their unanimous decree, to the
 emperor Zeno, the son-in-law and successor of Leo, who had
 lately been restored, after a short rebellion, to the
 Byzantine throne. They solemnly</p>
<blockquote> "disclaim the necessity, or even the wish, of continuing any longer the Imperial succession in Italy; since, in their opinion, the majesty of a sole monarch is sufficient to pervade and protect, at the same time, both the East and the West. In their own name, and in the name of the people, they consent that the seat of universal empire shall be transferred from Rome to Constantinople; and they basely renounce the right of choosing their master, the only vestige that yet remained of the authority which had given laws to the world. The republic <em> (they repeat that name without a blush) </em>  might safely confide in the civil and military virtues of Odoacer; and they humbly request that the emperor would invest him with the title of Patrician, and the administration of the <I>diocese</I> of Italy." </blockquote>

<p> The deputies of the senate were received at Constantinople with some mark of displeasure and indignation: and when they were admitted to the audience of Zeno, he sternly reproached them with their treatment of the two emperors, Anthemius and Nepos, whom the East had successively granted to the prayers of Italy. </p>
<blockquote>"The first <em> (continued he) </em> you have murdered; the second you have expelled: but the second is still alive, and whilst he lives he is your lawful sovereign." </blockquote>

<p> But the prudent Zeno soon deserted the hopeless cause of his abdicated colleague. His vanity was gratified by the title of sole emperor, and by the statues erected to his honour in the several quarters of Rome; he entertained a friendly, though ambiguous, correspondence with the <I>patrician</I> Odoacer; and he gratefully accepted the Imperial ensigns, the sacred ornaments of the throne and palace, which the barbarian was not unwilling to remove from the sight of the people. <small>(<a href="nt36/124.htm">124</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="banished"><small class="ok">Augustulus is banished to the Lucullan villa.</small><br> 
 In the space of twenty years since the death of Valentinian,
 nine emperors had successively disappeared; and the son of
 Orestes, a youth recommended only by his beauty, would be
 the least entitled to the notice of posterity, if his reign,
 which was marked by the extinction of the Roman empire in
 the West, did not leave a memorable era in the history of
 mankind.<small>(<a href="nt36/125.htm">125</a>)</small> The patrician Orestes had married the daughter 
 of Count <I>Romulus</I>, of Petovio in Noricum; the name of
 <I>Augustus</I>, notwithstanding the jealousy of power, was known
 at Aquileia as a familiar surname; and the appellations of
 the two great founders, of the city and of the monarchy,
 were thus strangely united in the last of their successors.
 <small>(<a href="nt36/126.htm">126</a>)</small> The son or Orestes assumed and disgraced the names of 
 Romulus Augustus; but the first was corrupted into Momyllus
 by the Greeks, and the second has been changed by the Latins
 into the contemptible diminutive Augustulus. The life of
 this inoffensive youth was spared by the generous clemency
 of Odoacer; who dismissed him, with his whole family, from
 the Imperial palace, fixed his annual allowance at six
 thousand pieces of gold, and assigned the castle of
 Lucullus, in Campania, for the place of his exile or
 retirement.<small>(<a href="nt36/127.htm">127</a>)</small> As soon as the Romans breathed from the 
 toils of the Punic war, they were attracted by the beauties
 and the pleasures of Campania; and the country-house of the
 elder Scipio at Liternum exhibited a lasting model of their
 rustic simplicity.<small>(<a href="nt36/128.htm">128</a>)</small> The delicious shores of the bay of 
 Naples were crowded with villas; and Sylla applauded the
 masterly skill of his rival, who had seated himself on the
 lofty promontory of Misenum, that commands, on every side,
 the sea and land, as far as the boundaries of the horizon.
 <small>(<a href="nt36/129.htm">129</a>)</small> The villa of Marius was purchased within a few years, by 
 Lucullus, and the price had increased from two thousand five
 hundred, to more than four-score thousand, pounds sterling.
 <small>(<a href="nt36/130.htm">130</a>)</small> It was adorned by the new proprietor with Grecian arts 
 and Asiatic treasures; and the houses and gardens of
 Lucullus obtained a distinguished rank in the list of
 Imperial palaces.<small>(<a href="nt36/131.htm">131</a>)</small> When the Vandals became formidable to 
 the seacoast, the Lucullan villa, on the promontory of
 Misenum, gradually assumed the strength and appellation of a
 strong castle, the obscure retreat of the last emperor of
 the West. About twenty years after that great revolution it
 was converted into a church and monastery, to receive the
 bones of St. Severinus. They securely reposed, amidst the
 broken trophies of Cimbric and Armenian victories, till the
 beginning of the tenth century; when the fortifications,
 which might afford a dangerous shelter to the Saracens, were
 demolished by the people of Naples.<small>(<a href="nt36/132.htm">132</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="decay"><small class="ok">Decay of the Roman spirit.</small><br> 
 Odoacer was the first barbarian who reigned in Italy, over a
 people who had once asserted their just superiority above
 the rest of mankind. The disgrace of the Romans still
 excites our respectful compassion, and we fondly sympathise
 with the imaginary grief and indignation of their degenerate
 posterity. But the calamities of Italy had gradually subdued
 the proud consciousness of freedom and glory. In the age of
 Roman virtue the provinces were subject to the arms, and the
 citizens to the laws, of the republic, till those laws were
 subverted by civil discord, and both the city and the
 provinces became the servile property of a tyrant. The forms
 of the constitution, which alleviated or disguised their
 abject slavery, were abolished by time and violence; the
 Italians alternately lamented the presence or the absence of
 the sovereigns whom they detested or despised; and the
 succession of five centuries inflicted the various evils of
 military licence, capricious despotism, and elaborate
 oppression. During the same period, the barbarians had
 emerged from obscurity and contempt, and the warriors of
 Germany and Scythia were introduced into the provinces, as
 the servants, the allies, and at length the masters, of the
 Romans, whom they insulted or protected. The hatred of the
 people was suppressed by fear; they respected the spirit and
 splendour of the martial chiefs who were invested with the
 honours of the empire; and the fate of Rome had long
 depended on the sword of those formidable strangers. The
 stern Ricimer, who trampled on the ruins of Italy, had
 exercised the power, without assuming the title, of a king;
 and the patient Romans were insensibly prepared to
 acknowledge the royalty of Odoacer and his barbaric
 successors.
 
</p><p id="reign"><small class="ok">Character and reign of Odoacer, A.D. 476-490.</small><br> 
 The king of Italy was not unworthy of the high station to
 which his valour and fortune had exalted him: his savage
 manners were polished by the habits of conversation; and he
 respected, though a conqueror and a barbarian, the
 institutions, and even the prejudices, of his subjects.
 After an interval of seven years, Odoacer restored the
 consulship of the West. For himself he modestly, or proudly,
 declined an honour which was still accepted by the emperors
 of the East; but the curule chair was successively filled by
 eleven of the most illustrious senators;<small>(<a href="nt36/133.htm">133</a>)</small> and the list is 
 adorned by the respectable name of Basilius, whose virtues
 claimed the friendship and grateful applause of Sidonius,
 his client.<small>(<a href="nt36/134.htm">134</a>)</small> The laws of the emperors were strictly 
 enforced, and the civil administration of Italy was still
 exercised by the Praetorian praefect and his subordinate
 officers. Odoacer devolved on the Roman magistrates the
 odious and oppressive task of collecting the public revenue;
 but he reserved for himself the merit of seasonable and
 popular indulgence.<small>(<a href="nt36/135.htm">135</a>)</small> Like the rest of the barbarians, he 
 had been instructed in the Arian heresy; but he revered the
 monastic and episcopal characters; and the silence of the
 catholics attests the toleration which they enjoyed. The
 peace of the city required the interposition of his praefect
 Basilius in the choice of a Roman pontiff: the decree which
 restrained the clergy from alienating their lands was
 ultimately designed for the benefit of the people, whose
 devotion would have been taxed to repair the dilapidations
 of the church. <small>(<a href="nt36/136.htm">136</a>)</small> Italy was protected by the arms of its 
 conqueror; and its frontiers were respected by the
 barbarians of Gaul and Germany, who had so long insulted the
 feeble race of Theodosius. Odoacer passed the Hadriatic, to
 chastise the assassins of the emperor Nepos, and to acquire
 the maritime province of Dalmatia. He passed the Alps, to
 rescue the remains of Noricum from Fava, or Feletheus, king
 of the Rugians, who held his residence beyond the Danube.
 The king was vanquished in battle, and led away prisoner; a
 numerous colony of captives and subjects was transplanted
 into Italy; and Rome, after a long period of defeat and
 disgrace, might claim the triumph of her barbarian master.
 <small>(<a href="nt36/137.htm">137</a>)</small> 

</p><p id="miserable"><small class="ok">Miserable state of Italy.</small><br> 
Notwithstanding the prudence and success of Odoacer, his
 kingdom exhibited the sad prospect of misery and desolation.
 Since the age of Tiberius, the decay of agriculture had been
 felt in Italy; and it was a just subject of complaint that
 the life of the Roman people depended on the accidents of
 the winds and waves.<small>(<a href="nt36/138.htm">138</a>)</small> In the division and the decline of the empire, the tributary harvests of Egypt and Africa were withdrawn; the numbers of the inhabitants continually
 diminished with the means of subsistence; and the country
 was exhausted by the irretrievable losses of war, famine,
 <small>(<a href="nt36/139.htm">139</a>)</small> and pestilence. St. Ambrose has deplored the ruin of a populous district, which had been once adorned with the flourishing cities of Bologna, Modena, Rhegium, and
 Placentia.<small>(<a href="nt36/140.htm">140</a>)</small> Pope Gelasius was a subject of Odoacer; and he affirms, with strong exaggeration, that in Aemilia, Tuscany, and the adjacent provinces, the human species was
 almost extirpated.<small>(<a href="nt36/141.htm">141</a>)</small> The plebians of Rome, who were fed by the hand of their master, perished or disappeared as soon as his liberality was suppressed; the decline of the arts
 reduced the industrious mechanic to idleness and want; and
 the senators, who might support with patience the ruin of
 their country, bewailed their private loss of wealth and
 luxury. One third of those ample estates, to which the ruin
 of Italy is originally imputed,<small>(<a href="nt36/142.htm">142</a>)</small> was extorted for the use 
 of the conquerors. Injuries were aggravated by insults; the
 sense of actual sufferings was embittered by the fear of
 more dreadful evils; and as new lands were allotted to new
 swarms of barbarians, each senator was apprehensive lest the
 arbitrary surveyors should approach his favourite villa, or
 his most profitable farm. The least unfortunate were those
 who submitted without a murmur to the power which it was
 impossible to resist. Since they desired to live, they owed
 some gratitude to the tyrant who had spared their lives; and
 since he was the absolute master of their fortunes, the
 portion which he left must be accepted as his pure and
 voluntary gift.<small>(<a href="nt36/143.htm">143</a>)</small> The distress of Italy was mitigated by 
 the prudence and humanity of Odoacer, who had bound himself,
 as the price of his elevation, to satisfy the demands of a
 licentious and turbulent multitude. The kings of the
 barbarians were frequently resisted, deposed, or murdered,
 by their native subjects; and the various bands of Italian
 mercenaries, who associated under the standard of an
 elective general, claimed a larger privilege of freedom and
 rapine. A monarchy destitute of national union and
 hereditary right hastened to its dissolution. After a reign
 of fourteen years Odoacer was oppressed by the superior
 genius of Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths; a hero alike
 excellent in the arts of war and of government, who restored
 an age of peace and prosperity, and whose name still excites
 and deserves the attention of mankind.</p>
