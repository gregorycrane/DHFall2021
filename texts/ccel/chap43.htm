</p> 

<p>The review of the nations from the Danube to the Nile has exposed, on every side, the weakness of the Romans; and our wonder is reasonably excited that they should presume to enlarge an empire whose ancient limits they were incapable of defending. But the wars, the conquests, and the triumphs of Justinian, are the feeble and pernicious efforts of old age, which exhaust the remains of strength, and accelerate the decay of the powers of life. He exulted in the glorious act of restoring Africa and Italy to the republic; but the calamities which followed the departure of Belisarius betrayed the impotence of the conqueror, and accomplished the ruin of those unfortunate countries.

</p><p id="africa"><small class="ok"><i>The troubles of Africa, A.D. 535-545</i></small><br>
From his new acquisitions, Justinian expected that his avarice, as well as pride, should be richly gratified. A rapacious minister of the finances closely pursued the footsteps of Belisarius; and as the old registers of tribute had been burnt by the Vandals, he indulged his fancy in a
 liberal calculation and arbitrary assessment of the wealth
 of Africa. <small>(<a href="nt430/001.htm">1</a>)</small> The increase of taxes, which were drawn away by a distant sovereign, and a general resumption of the
 patrimony or crown lands, soon dispelled the intoxication of
 the public joy: but the emperor was insensible to the modest
 complaints of the people, till he was awakened and alarmed
 by the clamors of military discontent. Many of the Roman
 soldiers had married the widows and daughters of the
 Vandals. As their own, by the double right of conquest and
 inheritance, they claimed the estates which Genseric had
 assigned to his victorious troops. They heard with disdain
 the cold and selfish representations of their officers, that
 the liberality of Justinian had raised them from a savage or
 servile condition; that they were already enriched by the
 spoils of Africa, the treasure, the slaves, and the movables
 of the vanquished Barbarians; and that the ancient and
 lawful patrimony of the emperors would be applied only to
 the support of that government on which their own safety and
 reward must ultimately depend. The mutiny was secretly
 inflamed by a thousand soldiers, for the most part Heruli,
 who had imbibed the doctrines, and were instigated by the
 clergy, of the Arian sect; and the cause of perjury and
 rebellion was sanctified by the dispensing powers of
 fanaticism. The Arians deplored the ruin of their church,
 triumphant above a century in Africa; and they were justly
 provoked by the laws of the conqueror, which interdicted the
 baptism of their children, and the exercise of all religious
 worship. Of the Vandals chosen by Belisarius, the far
 greater part, in the honors of the Eastern service, forgot
 their country and religion. But a generous band of four
 hundred obliged the mariners, when they were in sight of the
 Isle of Lesbos, to alter their course: they touched on
 Peloponnesus, ran ashore on a desert coast of Africa, and
 boldly erected, on Mount Aurasius, the standard of
 independence and revolt. While the troops of the provinces
 disclaimed the commands of their superiors, a conspiracy was
 formed at Carthage against the life of Solomon, who filled
 with honor the place of Belisarius; and the Arians had
 piously resolved to sacrifice the tyrant at the foot of the
 altar, during the awful mysteries of the festival of Easter.
 Fear or remorse restrained the daggers of the assassins, but
 the patience of Solomon emboldened their discontent; and, at
 the end of ten days, a furious sedition was kindled in the
 Circus, which desolated Africa above ten years. The pillage
 of the city, and the indiscriminate slaughter of its
 inhabitants, were suspended only by darkness, sleep, and
 intoxication: the governor, with seven companions, among
 whom was the historian Procopius, escaped to Sicily: two
 thirds of the army were involved in the guilt of treason;
 and eight thousand insurgents, assembling in the field of
 Bulla, elected Stoza for their chief, a private soldier, who
 possessed in a superior degree the virtues of a rebel.
 Under the mask of freedom, his eloquence could lead, or at
 least impel, the passions of his equals. He raised himself
 to a level with Belisarius, and the nephew of the emperor,
 by daring to encounter them in the field; and the victorious
 generals were compelled to acknowledge that Stoza deserved a
 purer cause, and a more legitimate command. Vanquished in
 battle, he dexterously employed the arts of negotiation; a
 Roman army was seduced from their allegiance, and the chiefs
 who had trusted to his faithless promise were murdered by
 his order in a church of Numidia. When every resource,
 either of force or perfidy, was exhausted, Stoza, with some
 desperate Vandals, retired to the wilds of Mauritania,
 obtained the daughter of a Barbarian prince, and eluded the
 pursuit of his enemies, by the report of his death. The
 personal weight of Belisarius, the rank, the spirit, and the
 temper, of Germanus, the emperor's nephew, and the vigor and
 success of the second administration of the eunuch Solomon,
 restored the modesty of the camp, and maintained for a while
 the tranquillity of Africa. But the vices of the Byzantine
 court were felt in that distant province; the troops
 complained that they were neither paid nor relieved, and as
 soon as the public disorders were sufficiently mature, Stoza
 was again alive, in arms, and at the gates of Carthage. He
 fell in a single combat, but he smiled in the agonies of
 death, when he was informed that his own javelin had reached
 the heart of his antagonist. <!-- A HREF="nt430/AXX.htm" (A) /A --> The example of Stoza, and
 the assurance that a fortunate soldier had been the first
 king, encouraged the ambition of Gontharis, and he promised,
 by a private treaty, to divide Africa with the Moors, if,
 with their dangerous aid, he should ascend the throne of
 Carthage. The feeble Areobindus, unskilled in the affairs
 of peace and war, was raised, by his marriage with the niece
 of Justinian, to the office of exarch. He was suddenly
 oppressed by a sedition of the guards, and his abject
 supplications, which provoked the contempt, could not move
 the pity, of the inexorable tyrant. After a reign of thirty
 days, Gontharis himself was stabbed at a banquet by the hand
 of Artaban; <!-- A HREF="nt430/BXX.htm" (B) /A--> and it is singular enough, that an Armenian  prince, of the royal family of Arsaces, should reestablish
 at Carthage the authority of the Roman empire. In the
 conspiracy which unsheathed the dagger of Brutus against the
 life of Caesar, every circumstance is curious and important
 to the eyes of posterity; but the guilt or merit of these
 loyal or rebellious assassins could interest only the
 contemporaries of Procopius, who, by their hopes and fears,
 their friendship or resentment, were personally engaged in
 the revolutions of Africa. <small>(<a href="nt430/002.htm">2</a>)</small>

</p><p id="moors"><small class="ok"><i>Rebellion of the Moors, A.D. 543-558</i></small><br>
 That country was rapidly sinking into the state of barbarism
 from whence it had been raised by the Phoenician colonies
 and Roman laws; and every step of intestine discord was
 marked by some deplorable victory of savage man over
 civilized society. The Moors, <small>(<a href="nt430/003.htm">3</a>)</small> though ignorant of justice,
 were impatient of oppression: their vagrant life and
 boundless wilderness disappointed the arms, and eluded the
 chains, of a conqueror; and experience had shown, that
 neither oaths nor obligations could secure the fidelity of
 their attachment. The victory of Mount Auras had awed them
 into momentary submission; but if they respected the
 character of Solomon, they hated and despised the pride and
 luxury of his two nephews, Cyrus and Sergius, on whom their
 uncle had imprudently bestowed the provincial governments of
 Tripoli and Pentapolis. A Moorish tribe encamped under the
 walls of Leptis, to renew their alliance, and receive from
 the governor the customary gifts. Fourscore of their
 deputies were introduced as friends into the city; but on
 the dark suspicion of a conspiracy, they were massacred at
 the table of Sergius, and the clamor of arms and revenge was
 reechoed through the valleys of Mount Atlas from both the
 Syrtes to the Atlantic Ocean. A personal injury, the unjust
 execution or murder of his brother, rendered Antalas the
 enemy of the Romans. The defeat of the Vandals had formerly
 signalized his valor; the rudiments of justice and prudence
 were still more conspicuous in a Moor; and while he laid
 Adrumetum in ashes, he calmly admonished the emperor that
 the peace of Africa might be secured by the recall of
 Solomon and his unworthy nephews. The exarch led forth his
 troops from Carthage: but, at the distance of six days'
 journey, in the neighborhood of Tebeste, <small>(<a href="nt430/004.htm">4</a>)</small> he was
 astonished by the superior numbers and fierce aspect of the
 Barbarians. He proposed a treaty; solicited a
 reconciliation; and offered to bind himself by the most
 solemn oaths. </p>
<blockquote> "By what oaths can he bind himself?" <em>interrupted the indignant Moors.</em> "Will he swear by the Gospels, the divine books of the Christians? It was on those books that the faith of his nephew Sergius was pledged to eighty of our innocent and unfortunate brethren. Before we trust them a second time, let us try their efficacy in the chastisement of perjury and the vindication of their own honour."</blockquote> 
<p>Their honour was vindicated in the field of Tebeste, by the death of Solomon, and the total loss of his army. <!-- a HREF="nt430/CXX.htm" (C)/a-->
The arrival of fresh troops and more skilful commanders soon checked the insolence of the Moors: seventeen of their princes were slain in the same battle; and the doubtful and transient submission of their tribes was celebrated with lavish applause by the people of Constantinople. Successive
 inroads had reduced the province of Africa to one third of the measure of Italy; yet the Roman emperors continued to reign above a century over Carthage and the fruitful coast of the Mediterranean. But the victories and the losses of Justinian were alike pernicious to mankind; and such was the
 desolation of Africa, that in many parts a stranger might wander whole days without meeting the face either of a friend or an enemy. The nation of the Vandals had disappeared: they once amounted to a hundred and sixty thousand warriors, without including the children, the women, or the slaves. Their numbers were infinitely surpassed by the number of the Moorish families extirpated in a relentless war; and the same destruction was retaliated on the Romans and their allies, who perished by the climate, their mutual quarrels, and the rage of the Barbarians. When Procopius first landed, he admired the populousness of the cities and country, strenuously exercised in the labors of
 commerce and agriculture. In less than twenty years, that
 busy scene was converted into a silent solitude; the wealthy
 citizens escaped to Sicily and Constantinople; and the
 secret historian has confidently affirmed, that five
 millions of Africans were consumed by the wars and
 government of the emperor Justinian. <small>(<a href="nt430/005.htm">5</a>)</small>

</p><p id="goths"><small class="ok"><i>Revolt of the Goths, A.D. 540.</i></small><br>
 The jealousy of the Byzantine court had not permitted
 Belisarius to achieve the conquest of Italy; and his abrupt
 departure revived the courage of the Goths, <small>(<a href="nt430/006.htm">6</a>)</small> who respected
 his genius, his virtue, and even the laudable motive which
 had urged the servant of Justinian to deceive and reject
 them. They had lost their king, (an inconsiderable loss,)
 their capital, their treasures, the provinces from Sicily to
 the Alps, and the military force of two hundred thousand
 Barbarians, magnificently equipped with horses and arms. Yet
 all was not lost, as long as Pavia was defended by one
 thousand Goths, inspired by a sense of honor, the love of
 freedom, and the memory of their past greatness. The
 supreme command was unanimously offered to the brave Uraias;
 and it was in his eyes alone that the disgrace of his uncle
 Vitiges could appear as a reason of exclusion. His voice
 inclined the election in favor of Hildibald, whose personal
 merit was recommended by the vain hope that his kinsman
 Theudes, the Spanish monarch, would support the common
 interest of the Gothic nation. The success of his arms in
 Liguria and Venetia seemed to justify their choice; but he
 soon declared to the world that he was incapable of
 forgiving or commanding his benefactor. The consort of
 Hildibald was deeply wounded by the beauty, the riches, and
 the pride, of the wife of Uraias; and the death of that
 virtuous patriot excited the indignation of a free people. A
 bold assassin executed their sentence by striking off the
 head of Hildibald in the midst of a banquet; the Rugians, a
 foreign tribe, assumed the privilege of election: and
 Totila, <!-- a HREF="nt430/DXX.htm" (D)/a--> the nephew of the late king, was tempted, by
 revenge, to deliver himself and the garrison of Trevigo into
 the hands of the Romans. But the gallant and accomplished
 youth was easily persuaded to prefer the Gothic throne
 before the service of Justinian; and as soon as the palace
 of Pavia had been purified from the Rugian usurper, he
 reviewed the national force of five thousand soldiers, and
 generously undertook the restoration of the kingdom of
 Italy.

</p><p id="totila"><small class="ok"><i>Victories of Totila, king of Italy, A.D. 541-544.</i></small><br>
 The successors of Belisarius, eleven generals of equal rank,
 neglected to crush the feeble and disunited Goths, till they
 were roused to action by the progress of Totila and the
 reproaches of Justinian. The gates of Verona were secretly
 opened to Artabazus, at the head of one hundred Persians in
 the service of the empire. The Goths fled from the city.
 At the distance of sixty furlongs the Roman generals halted
 to regulate the division of the spoil. While they disputed,
 the enemy discovered the real number of the victors: the
 Persians were instantly overpowered, and it was by leaping
 from the wall that Artabazus preserved a life which he lost
 in a few days by the lance of a Barbarian, who had defied
 him to single combat. Twenty thousand Romans encountered
 the forces of Totila, near Faenza, and on the hills of
 Mugello, of the Florentine territory. The ardor of
 freedmen, who fought to regain their country, was opposed to
 the languid temper of mercenary troops, who were even
 destitute of the merits of strong and well-disciplined
 servitude. On the first attack, they abandoned their
 ensigns, threw down their arms, and dispersed on all sides
 with an active speed, which abated the loss, whilst it
 aggravated the shame, of their defeat. The king of the
 Goths, who blushed for the baseness of his enemies, pursued
 with rapid steps the path of honor and victory. Totila
 passed the Po, <!-- a HREF="nt430/EXX.htm" (E)/a--> traversed the Apennine, suspended the
 important conquest of Ravenna, Florence, and Rome, and
 marched through the heart of Italy, to form the siege or
 rather the blockade, of Naples. The Roman chiefs,
 imprisoned in their respective cities, and accusing each
 other of the common disgrace, did not presume to disturb his
 enterprise. But the emperor, alarmed by the distress and
 danger of his Italian conquests, despatched to the relief of
 Naples a fleet of galleys and a body of Thracian and
 Armenian soldiers. They landed in Sicily, which yielded its
 copious stores of provisions; but the delays of the new
 commander, an unwarlike magistrate, protracted the
 sufferings of the besieged; and the succors, which he
 dropped with a timid and tardy hand, were successively
 intercepted by the armed vessels stationed by Totila in the
 Bay of Naples. The principal officer of the Romans was
 dragged, with a rope round his neck, to the foot of the
 wall, from whence, with a trembling voice, he exhorted the
 citizens to implore, like himself, the mercy of the
 conqueror. They requested a truce, with a promise of
 surrendering the city, if no effectual relief should appear
 at the end of thirty days. Instead of one month, the
 audacious Barbarian granted them three, in the just
 confidence that famine would anticipate the term of their
 capitulation. After the reduction of Naples and Cumae, the
 provinces of Lucania, Apulia, and Calabria, submitted to the
 king of the Goths. Totila led his army to the gates of
 Rome, pitched his camp at Tibur, or Tivoli, within twenty
 miles of the capital, and calmly exhorted the senate and
 people to compare the tyranny of the Greeks with the
 blessings of the Gothic reign.

</p><p id="contrast"><small class="ok"><i>Contrast of vice and virtue.</i></small><br>
 The rapid success of Totila may be partly ascribed to the
 revolution which three years' experience had produced in the
 sentiments of the Italians. At the command, or at least in
 the name, of a Catholic emperor, the pope, <small>(<a href="nt430/007.htm">7</a>)</small> their
 spiritual father, had been torn from the Roman church, and
 either starved or murdered on a desolate island. <small>(<a href="nt430/008.htm">8</a>)</small> The
 virtues of Belisarius were replaced by the various or
 uniform vices of eleven chiefs, at Rome, Ravenna, Florence,
 Perugia, Spoleto, etc., who abused their authority for the
 indulgence of lust or avarice. The improvement of the
 revenue was committed to Alexander, a subtle scribe, long
 practised in the fraud and oppression of the Byzantine
 schools, and whose name of <I>Psalliction</I>, the <I>scissars</I>, <small>(<a href="nt430/009.htm">9</a>)</small> was
 drawn from the dexterous artifice with which he reduced the
 size without defacing the figure, of the gold coin. Instead
 of expecting the restoration of peace and industry, he
 imposed a heavy assessment on the fortunes of the Italians.
 Yet his present or future demands were less odious than a
 prosecution of arbitrary rigor against the persons and
 property of all those who, under the Gothic kings, had been
 concerned in the receipt and expenditure of the public
 money. The subjects of Justinian, who escaped these partial
 vexations, were oppressed by the irregular maintenance of
 the soldiers, whom Alexander defrauded and despised; and
 their hasty sallies in quest of wealth, or subsistence,
 provoked the inhabitants of the country to await or implore
 their deliverance from the virtues of a Barbarian. Totila
 <small>(<a href="nt430/010.htm">10</a>)</small> was chaste and temperate; and none were deceived, either
 friends or enemies, who depended on his faith or his
 clemency. To the husbandmen of Italy the Gothic king issued
 a welcome proclamation, enjoining them to pursue their
 important labors, and to rest assured, that, on the payment
 of the ordinary taxes, they should be defended by his valor
 and discipline from the injuries of war. The strong towns
 he successively attacked; and as soon as they had yielded to
 his arms, he demolished the fortifications, to save the
 people from the calamities of a future siege, to deprive the
 Romans of the arts of defence, and to decide the tedious
 quarrel of the two nations, by an equal and honorable
 conflict in the field of battle. The Roman captives and
 deserters were tempted to enlist in the service of a liberal
 and courteous adversary; the slaves were attracted by the
 firm and faithful promise, that they should never be
 delivered to their masters; and from the thousand warriors
 of Pavia, a new people, under the same appellation of Goths,
 was insensibly formed in the camp of Totila. He sincerely
 accomplished the articles of capitulation, without seeking
 or accepting any sinister advantage from ambiguous
 expressions or unforeseen events: the garrison of Naples had
 stipulated that they should be transported by sea; the
 obstinacy of the winds prevented their voyage, but they were
 generously supplied with horses, provisions, and a
 safe-conduct to the gates of Rome. The wives of the
 senators, who had been surprised in the villas of Campania,
 were restored, without a ransom, to their husbands; the
 violation of female chastity was inexorably chastised with
 death; and in the salutary regulation of the edict of the
 famished Neapolitans, the conqueror assumed the office of a
 humane and attentive physician. The virtues of Totila are
 equally laudable, whether they proceeded from true policy,
 religious principle, or the instinct of humanity: he often
 harangued his troops; and it was his constant theme, that
 national vice and ruin are inseparably connected; that
 victory is the fruit of moral as well as military virtue;
 and that the prince, and even the people, are responsible
 for the crimes which they neglect to punish.

</p><p id="second"><small class="ok"><i>Second command of Belissarius in Italy, A.D. 544-548.</i></small><br>
 The return of Belisarius to save the country which he had
 subdued, was pressed with equal vehemence by his friends and
 enemies; and the Gothic war was imposed as a trust or an
 exile on the veteran commander. A hero on the banks of the
 Euphrates, a slave in the palace of Constantinople, he
 accepted with reluctance the painful task of supporting his
 own reputation, and retrieving the faults of his successors.
 The sea was open to the Romans: the ships and soldiers were
 assembled at Salona, near the palace of Diocletian: he
 refreshed and reviewed his troops at Pola in Istria, coasted
 round the head of the Adriatic, entered the port of Ravenna,
 and despatched orders rather than supplies to the
 subordinate cities. His first public oration was addressed
 to the Goths and Romans, in the name of the emperor, who had
 suspended for a while the conquest of Persia, and listened
 to the prayers of his Italian subjects. He gently touched
 on the causes and the authors of the recent disasters;
 striving to remove the fear of punishment for the past, and
 the hope of impunity for the future, and laboring, with more
 zeal than success, to unite all the members of his
 government in a firm league of affection and obedience.
 Justinian, his gracious master, was inclined to pardon and reward; and it was their interest, as well as duty, to reclaim their deluded brethren, who had been seduced by the arts of the usurper. Not a man was tempted to desert the standard of the Gothic king. Belisarius soon discovered, that he was sent to remain the idle and impotent spectator of the glory of a young Barbarian; and his own epistle exhibits a genuine and lively picture of the distress of a noble mind. </p>
<blockquote> "Most excellent prince, we are arrived in Italy, destitute of all the necessary implements of war, men, horses, arms, and money. In our late circuit through the villages of Thrace and Illyricum, we have collected,
 with extreme difficulty, about four thousand recruits, naked, and unskilled in the use of weapons and the exercises of the camp. The soldiers already stationed in the province are discontented, fearful, and dismayed; at the sound of an enemy, they dismiss their horses, and cast their arms on the
 ground. No taxes can be raised, since Italy is in the hands of the Barbarians; the failure of payment has deprived us of the right of command, or even of admonition. Be assured, dread Sir, that the greater part of your troops have already deserted to the Goths. If the war could be achieved by the presence of Belisarius alone, your wishes are satisfied; Belisarius is in the midst of Italy. But if you desire to conquer, far other preparations are requisite: without a military force, the title of general is an empty name. It would be expedient to restore to my service my own veteran and domestic guards. Before I can take the field, I must receive an adequate supply of light and heavy armed troops; and it is only with ready money that you can procure the indispensable aid of a powerful body of the cavalry of the
 Huns." <em><small>(<a href="nt430/011.htm">11</a>)</small></em> </blockquote> 
<p>An officer in whom Belisarius confided was sent from Ravenna to hasten and conduct the succours; but the message was neglected, and the messenger was detained at Constantinople by an advantageous marriage. After his patience had been exhausted by delay and disappointment, the Roman general repassed the Adriatic, and expected at Dyrrachium the arrival of the troops, which were slowly assembled among the subjects and allies of the empire. His
 powers were still inadequate to the deliverance of Rome, which was closely besieged by the Gothic king. The Appian way, a march of forty days, was covered by the Barbarians;
 and as the prudence of Belisarius declined a battle, he
 preferred the safe and speedy navigation of five days from
 the coast of Epirus to the mouth of the Tyber.

</p><p id="rome"><small class="ok"><i>Rome besieged by the Goths, A.D. 546, May.</i></small><br>
 After reducing, by force, or treaty, the towns of inferior
 note in the midland provinces of Italy, Totila proceeded,
 not to assault, but to encompass and starve, the ancient
 capital. Rome was afflicted by the avarice, and guarded by
 the valor, of Bessas, a veteran chief of Gothic extraction,
 who filled, with a garrison of three thousand soldiers, the
 spacious circle of her venerable walls. From the distress
 of the people he extracted a profitable trade, and secretly
 rejoiced in the continuance of the siege. It was for his
 use that the granaries had been replenished: the charity of
 Pope Vigilius had purchased and embarked an ample supply of
 Sicilian corn; but the vessels which escaped the Barbarians
 were seized by a rapacious governor, who imparted a scanty
 sustenance to the soldiers, and sold the remainder to the
 wealthy Romans. The medimnus, or fifth part of the quarter
 of wheat, was exchanged for seven pieces of gold; fifty
 pieces were given for an ox, a rare and accidental prize;
 the progress of famine enhanced this exorbitant value, and
 the mercenaries were tempted to deprive themselves of the
 allowance which was scarcely sufficient for the support of
 life. A tasteless and unwholesome mixture, in which the
 bran thrice exceeded the quantity of flour, appeased the
 hunger of the poor; they were gradually reduced to feed on
 dead horses, dogs, cats, and mice, and eagerly to snatch the
 grass, and even the nettles, which grew among the ruins of
 the city. A crowd of spectres, pale and emaciated, their
 bodies oppressed with disease, and their minds with despair,
 surrounded the palace of the governor, urged, with
 unavailing truth, that it was the duty of a master to
 maintain his slaves, and humbly requested that he would
 provide for their subsistence, to permit their flight, or
 command their immediate execution. Bessas replied, with
 unfeeling tranquillity, that it was impossible to feed,
 unsafe to dismiss, and unlawful to kill, the subjects of the
 emperor. Yet the example of a private citizen might have shown his countrymen that a tyrant cannot withhold the privilege of death. Pierced by the cries of five children, who vainly called on their father for bread, he ordered them to follow his steps, advanced with calm and silent despair to one of the bridges of the Tyber, and, covering his face, threw himself headlong into the stream, in the presence of his family and the Roman people. To the rich and pusillammous, Bessas <small>(<a href="nt430/012.htm">12</a>)</small> sold the permission of departure; but the greatest part of the fugitives expired on the public highways, or were intercepted by the flying parties of Barbarians. In the mean while, the artful governor soothed the discontent, and revived the hopes of the Romans, by the vague reports of the fleets and armies which were hastening to their relief from the extremities of the East. They derived more rational comfort from the assurance that Belisarius had landed at the <I>port</I>; and, without numbering his forces, they firmly relied on the humanity, the courage, and the skill of their great deliverer.

</p><p id="attempt"><small class="ok"><i>Attempt of Belisarius.</i></small><br>
 The foresight of Totila had raised obstacles worthy of such
 an antagonist. Ninety furlongs below the city, in the
 narrowest part of the river, he joined the two banks by
 strong and solid timbers in the form of a bridge, on which
 he erected two lofty towers, manned by the bravest of his
 Goths, and profusely stored with missile weapons and engines
 of offence. The approach of the bridge and towers was
 covered by a strong and massy chain of iron; and the chain,
 at either end, on the opposite sides of the Tyber, was
 defended by a numerous and chosen detachment of archers.
 But the enterprise of forcing these barriers, and relieving
 the capital, displays a shining example of the boldness and
 conduct of Belisarius. His cavalry advanced from the port
 along the public road, to awe the motions, and distract the
 attention of the enemy. His infantry and provisions were
 distributed in two hundred large boats; and each boat was
 shielded by a high rampart of thick planks, pierced with
 many small holes for the discharge of missile weapons. In
 the front, two large vessels were linked together to sustain
 a floating castle, which commanded the towers of the bridge,
 and contained a magazine of fire, sulphur, and bitumen. The
 whole fleet, which the general led in person, was
 laboriously moved against the current of the river. The
 chain yielded to their weight, and the enemies who guarded
 the banks were either slain or scattered. As soon as they
 touched the principal barrier, the fire- ship was instantly
 grappled to the bridge; one of the towers, with two hundred
 Goths, was consumed by the flames; the assailants shouted
 victory; and Rome was saved, if the wisdom of Belisarius had
 not been defeated by the misconduct of his officers. He had
 previously sent orders to Bessas to second his operations by
 a timely sally from the town; and he had fixed his
 lieutenant, Isaac, by a peremptory command, to the station
 of the port. But avarice rendered Bessas immovable; while
 the youthful ardor of Isaac delivered him into the hands of
 a superior enemy. The exaggerated rumor of his defeat was
 hastily carried to the ears of Belisarius: he paused;
 betrayed in that single moment of his life some emotions of
 surprise and perplexity; and reluctantly sounded a retreat
 to save his wife Antonina, his treasures, and the only
 harbor which he possessed on the Tuscan coast. The vexation
 of his mind produced an ardent and almost mortal fever; and
 Rome was left without protection to the mercy or indignation
 of Totila. The continuance of hostilities had imbittered
 the national hatred: the Arian clergy was ignominiously
 driven from Rome; Pelagius, the archdeacon, returned without
 success from an embassy to the Gothic camp; and a Sicilian
 bishop, the envoy or nuncio of the pope, was deprived of
 both his hands, for daring to utter falsehoods in the
 service of the church and state.

</p><p id="taken"><small class="ok"><i>Rome taken by the Goths, A.D. 546, Dec. 17.</i></small><br>
 Famine had relaxed the strength and discipline of the
 garrison of Rome. They could derive no effectual service
 from a dying people; and the inhuman avarice of the merchant
 at length absorbed the vigilance of the governor. Four
 Isaurian sentinels, while their companions slept, and their
 officers were absent, descended by a rope from the wall, and
 secretly proposed to the Gothic king to introduce his troops
 into the city. The offer was entertained with coldness and
 suspicion; they returned in safety; they twice repeated
 their visit; the place was twice examined; the conspiracy
 was known and disregarded; and no sooner had Totila
 consented to the attempt, than they unbarred the Asinarian
 gate, and gave admittance to the Goths. Till the dawn of
 day, they halted in order of battle, apprehensive of
 treachery or ambush; but the troops of Bessas, with their
 leader, had already escaped; and when the king was pressed
 to disturb their retreat, he prudently replied, that no
 sight could be more grateful than that of a flying enemy.
 The patricians, who were still possessed of horses, Decius,
 Basilius, etc. accompanied the governor; their brethren,
 among whom Olybrius, Orestes, and Maximus, are named by the
 historian, took refuge in the church of St. Peter: but the
 assertion, that only five hundred persons remained in the
 capital, inspires some doubt of the fidelity either of his
 narrative or of his text. As soon as daylight had displayed
 the entire victory of the Goths, their monarch devoutly
 visited the tomb of the prince of the apostles; but while he
 prayed at the altar, twenty-five soldiers, and sixty
 citizens, were put to the sword in the vestibule of the
 temple. The archdeacon Pelagius <small>(<a href="nt430/013.htm">13</a>)</small> stood before him, with the Gospels in his hand. </p>
<blockquote> "O Lord, be merciful to your servant." </blockquote> 
<blockquote>"Pelagius," <em>said Totila, with an insulting smile,</em>
 "your pride now condescends to become a suppliant." </blockquote> 
<blockquote>"I <I>am</I> a suppliant," <em>replied the prudent archdeacon;</em> "God has now made us your subjects, and as your subjects, we are entitled to your clemency." </blockquote> 
<p> At his humble prayer, the lives of the Romans were spared; and the chastity of the maids and matrons was preserved inviolate from the passions of the hungry soldiers. But they were rewarded by the freedom of pillage, after the most precious spoils had been reserved for the royal treasury. The houses of the senators were plentifully stored with gold and silver; and the avarice of Bessas had laboured with so much guilt and shame for the benefit of the conqueror. In this revolution, the sons and daughters of Roman consuls lasted the misery which they had spurned or relieved, wandered in tattered garments through the streets of the city and begged their bread, perhaps
 without success, before the gates of their hereditary mansions. The riches of Rusticiana, the daughter of Symmachus and widow of Boethius, had been generously devoted to alleviate the calamities of famine. But the Barbarians
 were exasperated by the report, that she had prompted the people to overthrow the statues of the great Theodoric; and the life of that venerable matron would have been sacrificed to his memory, if Totila had not respected her birth, her virtues, and even the pious motive of her revenge. The next
 day he pronounced two orations, to congratulate and admonish his victorious Goths, and to reproach the senate, as the vilest of slaves, with their perjury, folly, and ingratitude; sternly declaring, that their estates and
 honours were justly forfeited to the companions of his arms. Yet he consented to forgive their revolt; and the senators
 repaid his clemency by despatching circular letters to their
 tenants and vassals in the provinces of Italy, strictly to
 enjoin them to desert the standard of the Greeks, to
 cultivate their lands in peace, and to learn from their
 masters the duty of obedience to a Gothic sovereign. Against
 the city which had so long delayed the course of his
 victories, he appeared inexorable: one third of the walls,
 in different parts, were demolished by his command; fire and
 engines prepared to consume or subvert the most stately
 works of antiquity; and the world was astonished by the
 fatal decree, that Rome should be changed into a pasture for
 cattle. The firm and temperate remonstrance of Belisarius
 suspended the execution; he warned the Barbarian not to
 sully his fame by the destruction of those monuments which
 were the glory of the dead, and the delight of the living;
 and Totila was persuaded, by the advice of an enemy, to
 preserve Rome as the ornament of his kingdom, or the fairest
 pledge of peace and reconciliation. When he had signified to
 the ambassadors of Belisarius his intention of sparing the
 city, he stationed an army at the distance of one hundred
 and twenty furlongs, to observe the motions of the Roman
 general. With the remainder of his forces he marched into
 Lucania and Apulia, and occupied on the summit of Mount
 Garganus <small>(<a href="nt430/014.htm">14</a>)</small> one of the camps of Hannibal. <small>(<a href="nt430/015.htm">15</a>)</small> The senators
 were dragged in his train, and afterwards confined in the
 fortresses of Campania: the citizens, with their wives and
 children, were dispersed in exile; and during forty days
 Rome was abandoned to desolate and dreary solitude. <small>(<a href="nt430/016.htm">16</a>)</small>

</p><p id="recovered"><small class="ok"><i>Recovered by Belisarius, A.D. 547, February.</i></small><br>
 The loss of Rome was speedily retrieved by an action, to
 which, according to the event, the public opinion would
 apply the names of rashness or heroism. After the departure
 of Totila, the Roman general sallied from the port at the
 head of a thousand horse, cut in pieces the enemy who
 opposed his progress, and visited with pity and reverence
 the vacant space of the <I>eternal</I> city. Resolved to maintain a
 station so conspicuous in the eyes of mankind, he summoned
 the greatest part of his troops to the standard which he
 erected on the Capitol: the old inhabitants were recalled by
 the love of their country and the hopes of food; and the
 keys of Rome were sent a second time to the emperor
 Justinian. The walls, as far as they had been demolished by
 the Goths, were repaired with rude and dissimilar materials;
 the ditch was restored; iron spikes <small>(<a href="nt430/017.htm">17</a>)</small> were profusely
 scattered in the highways to annoy the feet of the horses;
 and as new gates could not suddenly be procured, the
 entrance was guarded by a Spartan rampart of his bravest
 soldiers. At the expiration of twenty-five days, Totila
 returned by hasty marches from Apulia to avenge the injury
 and disgrace. Belisarius expected his approach. The Goths
 were thrice repulsed in three general assaults; they lost
 the flower of their troops; the royal standard had almost
 fallen into the hands of the enemy, and the fame of Totila
 sunk, as it had risen, with the fortune of his arms.
 Whatever skill and courage could achieve, had been performed
 by the Roman general: it remained only that Justinian should
 terminate, by a strong and seasonable effort, the war which
 he had ambitiously undertaken. The indolence, perhaps the
 impotence, of a prince who despised his enemies, and envied
 his servants, protracted the calamities of Italy. After a
 long silence, Belisarius was commanded to leave a sufficient
 garrison at Rome, and to transport himself into the province
 of Lucania, whose inhabitants, inflamed by Catholic zeal,
 had cast away the yoke of their Arian conquerors. In this
 ignoble warfare, the hero, invincible against the power of
 the Barbarians, was basely vanquished by the delay, the
 disobedience, and the cowardice of his own officers. He
 reposed in his winter quarters of Crotona, in the full
 assurance, that the two passes of the Lucanian hills were
 guarded by his cavalry. They were betrayed by treachery or
 weakness; and the rapid march of the Goths scarcely allowed
 time for the escape of Belisarius to the coast of Sicily.
 At length a fleet and army were assembled for the relief of
 Ruscianum, or Rossano, <small>(<a href="nt430/018.htm">18</a>)</small> a fortress sixty furlongs from
 the ruins of Sybaris, where the nobles of Lucania had taken
 refuge. In the first attempt, the Roman forces were
 dissipated by a storm. In the second, they approached the
 shore; but they saw the hills covered with archers, the
 landing-place defended by a line of spears, and the king of
 the Goths impatient for battle. The conqueror of Italy
 retired with a sigh, and continued to languish, inglorious
 and inactive, till Antonina, who had been sent to
 Constantinople to solicit succors, obtained, after the death
 of the empress, the permission of his return.

</p><p id="final"><small class="ok"><i>Final recall of Belisarius, A.D. 548, September.</i></small><br>
 The five last campaigns of Belisarius might abate the envy
 of his competitors, whose eyes had been dazzled and wounded
 by the blaze of his former glory. Instead of delivering
 Italy from the Goths, he had wandered like a fugitive along
 the coast, without daring to march into the country, or to
 accept the bold and repeated challenge of Totila. Yet, in
 the judgment of the few who could discriminate counsels from
 events, and compare the instruments with the execution, he
 appeared a more consummate master of the art of war, than in
 the season of his prosperity, when he presented two captive
 kings before the throne of Justinian. The valor of
 Belisarius was not chilled by age: his prudence was matured
 by experience; but the moral virtues of humanity and justice
 seem to have yielded to the hard necessity of the times.
 The parsimony or poverty of the emperor compelled him to
 deviate from the rule of conduct which had deserved the love
 and confidence of the Italians. The war was maintained by
 the oppression of Ravenna, Sicily, and all the faithful
 subjects of the empire; and the rigorous prosecution of
 Herodian provoked that injured or guilty officer to deliver
 Spoleto into the hands of the enemy. The avarice of
 Antonina, which had been some times diverted by love, now
 reigned without a rival in her breast. Belisarius himself
 had always understood, that riches, in a corrupt age, are
 the support and ornament of personal merit. And it cannot
 be presumed that he should stain his honor for the public
 service, without applying a part of the spoil to his private
 emolument. The hero had escaped the sword of the
 Barbarians. But the dagger of conspiracy <small>(<a href="nt430/019.htm">19</a>)</small> awaited his
 return. In the midst of wealth and honors, Artaban, who had
 chastised the African tyrant, complained of the ingratitude
 of courts. He aspired to Praejecta, the emperor's niece,
 who wished to reward her deliverer; but the impediment of
 his previous marriage was asserted by the piety of Theodora.
 The pride of royal descent was irritated by flattery; and
 the service in which he gloried had proved him capable of
 bold and sanguinary deeds. The death of Justinian was
 resolved, but the conspirators delayed the execution till
 they could surprise Belisarius disarmed, and naked, in the
 palace of Constantinople. Not a hope could be entertained
 of shaking his long-tried fidelity; and they justly dreaded
 the revenge, or rather the justice, of the veteran general,
 who might speedily assemble an army in Thrace to punish the
 assassins, and perhaps to enjoy the fruits of their crime.
 Delay afforded time for rash communications and honest
 confessions: Artaban and his accomplices were condemned by
 the senate, but the extreme clemency of Justinian detained
 them in the gentle confinement of the palace, till he
 pardoned their flagitious attempt against his throne and
 life. If the emperor forgave his enemies, he must cordially
 embrace a friend whose victories were alone remembered, and
 who was endeared to his prince by the recent circumstances
 of their common danger. Belisarius reposed from his toils,
 in the high station of general of the East and count of the
 domestics; and the older consuls and patricians respectfully
 yielded the precedency of rank to the peerless merit of the
 first of the Romans. <small>(<a href="nt430/020.htm">20</a>)</small> The first of the Romans still
 submitted to be the slave of his wife; but the servitude of
 habit and affection became less disgraceful when the death
 of Theodora had removed the baser influence of fear.
 Joannina, their daughter, and the sole heiress of their
 fortunes, was betrothed to Anastasius, the grandson, or
 rather the nephew, of the empress, <small>(<a href="nt430/021.htm">21</a>)</small> whose kind
 interposition forwarded the consummation of their youthful
 loves. But the power of Theodora expired, the parents of
 Joannina returned, and her honor, perhaps her happiness,
 were sacrificed to the revenge of an unfeeling mother, who
 dissolved the imperfect nuptials before they had been
 ratified by the ceremonies of the church. <small>(<a href="nt430/022.htm">22</a>)</small>

</p><p id="again"><small class="ok"><i>Rome again taken by the Goths, A.D. 549.</i></small><br>
 Before the departure of Belisarius, Perusia was besieged,
 and few cities were impregnable to the Gothic arms.
 Ravenna, Ancona, and Crotona, still resisted the Barbarians;
 and when Totila asked in marriage one of the daughters of
 France, he was stung by the just reproach that the king of
 Italy was unworthy of his title till it was acknowledged by
 the Roman people. Three thousand of the bravest soldiers had
 been left to defend the capital. On the suspicion of a
 monopoly, they massacred the governor, and announced to
 Justinian, by a deputation of the clergy, that unless their
 offence was pardoned, and their arrears were satisfied, they
 should instantly accept the tempting offers of Totila. But
 the officer who succeeded to the command (his name was
 Diogenes) deserved their esteem and confidence; and the
 Goths, instead of finding an easy conquest, encountered a
 vigorous resistance from the soldiers and people, who
 patiently endured the loss of the port and of all maritime
 supplies. The siege of Rome would perhaps have been raised,
 if the liberality of Totila to the Isaurians had not
 encouraged some of their venal countrymen to copy the
 example of treason. In a dark night, while the Gothic
 trumpets sounded on another side, they silently opened the
 gate of St. Paul: the Barbarians rushed into the city; and
 the flying garrison was intercepted before they could reach
 the harbor of Centumcellae. A soldier trained in the school
 of Belisarius, Paul of Cilicia, retired with four hundred
 men to the mole of Hadrian. They repelled the Goths; but
 they felt the approach of famine; and their aversion to the
 taste of horse-flesh confirmed their resolution to risk the
 event of a desperate and decisive sally. But their spirit
 insensibly stooped to the offers of capitulation; they
 retrieved their arrears of pay, and preserved their arms and
 horses, by enlisting in the service of Totila; their chiefs,
 who pleaded a laudable attachment to their wives and
 children in the East, were dismissed with honor; and above
 four hundred enemies, who had taken refuge in the
 sanctuaries, were saved by the clemency of the victor. He
 no longer entertained a wish of destroying the edifices of
 Rome, <small>(<a href="nt430/023.htm">23</a>)</small> which he now respected as the seat of the Gothic
 kingdom: the senate and people were restored to their
 country; the means of subsistence were liberally provided;
 and Totila, in the robe of peace, exhibited the equestrian
 games of the circus. Whilst he amused the eyes of the
 multitude, four hundred vessels were prepared for the
 embarkation of his troops. The cities of Rhegium and
 Tarentum were reduced: he passed into Sicily, the object of
 his implacable resentment; and the island was stripped of its gold and silver, of the fruits of the earth, and of an infinite number of horses, sheep, and oxen. Sardinia and Corsica obeyed the fortune of Italy; and the sea-coast of Greece was visited by a fleet of three hundred galleys. <small>(<a href="nt430/024.htm">24</a>)</small> The Goths were landed in Corcyra and the ancient continent of Epirus; they advanced as far as Nicopolis, the trophy of Augustus, and Dodona, <small>(<a href="nt430/025.htm">25</a>)</small> once famous by the oracle of Jove. In every step of his victories, the wise Barbarian repeated to Justinian the desire of peace, applauded the concord of their predecessors, and offered to employ the Gothic arms in the service of the empire.

</p><p id="preparations"><small class="ok"><i>Preparations by Justinian for the Gothic war, A.D. 549-551.</i></small><br>
 Justinian was deaf to the voice of peace: but he neglected
 the prosecution of war; and the indolence of his temper
 disappointed, in some degree, the obstinacy of his passions.
 From this salutary slumber the emperor was awakened by the
 pope Vigilius and the patrician Cethegus, who appeared
 before his throne, and adjured him, in the name of God and
 the people, to resume the conquest and deliverance of Italy.
 In the choice of the generals, caprice, as well as judgment,
 was shown. A fleet and army sailed for the relief of
 Sicily, under the conduct of Liberius; but his youth <!-- a HREF="nt430/FXX.htm" (F)/a--> and want of experience were afterwards discovered, and before he
 touched the shores of the island he was overtaken by his
 successor. In the place of Liberius, the conspirator
 Artaban was raised from a prison to military honors; in the
 pious presumption, that gratitude would animate his valor
 and fortify his allegiance. Belisarius reposed in the shade
 of his laurels, but the command of the principal army was
 reserved for Germanus, <small>(<a href="nt430/026.htm">26</a>)</small> the emperor's nephew, whose rank and merit had been long depressed by the jealousy of the court. Theodora had injured him in the rights of a private
 citizen, the marriage of his children, and the testament of
 his brother; and although his conduct was pure and
 blameless, Justinian was displeased that he should be
 thought worthy of the confidence of the malecontents. The
 life of Germanus was a lesson of implicit obedience: he
 nobly refused to prostitute his name and character in the
 factions of the circus: the gravity of his manners was
 tempered by innocent cheerfulness; and his riches were lent
 without interest to indigent or deserving friends. His
 valor had formerly triumphed over the Sclavonians of the
 Danube and the rebels of Africa: the first report of his
 promotion revived the hopes of the Italians; and he was
 privately assured, that a crowd of Roman deserters would
 abandon, on his approach, the standard of Totila. His second
 marriage with Malasontha, the granddaughter of Theodoric
 endeared Germanus to the Goths themselves; and they marched
 with reluctance against the father of a royal infant the
 last offspring of the line of Amali. <small>(<a href="nt430/027.htm">27</a>)</small> A splendid
 allowance was assigned by the emperor: the general
 contribute his private fortune: his two sons were popular
 and active and he surpassed, in the promptitude and success
 of his levies the expectation of mankind. He was permitted
 to select some squadrons of Thracian cavalry: the veterans,
 as well as the youth of Constantinople and Europe, engaged
 their voluntary service; and as far as the heart of Germany,
 his fame and liberality attracted the aid of the Barbarians.
 <!-- a HREF="nt430/GXX.htm" (G)/a--> The Romans advanced to Sardica; an army of Sclavonians
 fled before their march; but within two days of their final
 departure, the designs of Germanus were terminated by his
 malady and death. Yet the impulse which he had given to the
 Italian war still continued to act with energy and effect.
 The maritime towns Ancona, Crotona, Centumcellae, resisted
 the assaults of Totila Sicily was reduced by the zeal of
 Artaban, and the Gothic navy was defeated near the coast of
 the Adriatic. The two fleets were almost equal, forty-seven
 to fifty galleys: the victory was decided by the knowledge
 and dexterity of the Greeks; but the ships were so closely
 grappled, that only twelve of the Goths escaped from this
 unfortunate conflict. They affected to depreciate an
 element in which they were unskilled; but their own
 experience confirmed the truth of a maxim, that the master
 of the sea will always acquire the dominion of the land. <small>(<a href="nt430/028.htm">28</a>)</small>

</p><p id="narses"><small class="ok"><i>Character and expedition of the eunuch Narses, A.D. 552.</i></small><br>
 After the loss of Germanus, the nations were provoked to
 smile, by the strange intelligence, that the command of the
 Roman armies was given to a eunuch. But the eunuch Narses
 <small>(<a href="nt430/029.htm">29</a>)</small> is ranked among the few who have rescued that unhappy
 name from the contempt and hatred of mankind. A feeble,
 diminutive body concealed the soul of a statesman and a
 warrior. His youth had been employed in the management of
 the loom and distaff, in the cares of the household, and the
 service of female luxury; but while his hands were busy, he
 secretly exercised the faculties of a vigorous and
 discerning mind. A stranger to the schools and the camp, he
 studied in the palace to dissemble, to flatter, and to
 persuade; and as soon as he approached the person of the
 emperor, Justinian listened with surprise and pleasure to
 the manly counsels of his chamberlain and private treasurer.
 <small>(<a href="nt430/030.htm">30</a>)</small> The talents of Narses were tried and improved in
 frequent embassies: he led an army into Italy acquired a
 practical knowledge of the war and the country, and presumed
 to strive with the genius of Belisarius. Twelve years after
 his return, the eunuch was chosen to achieve the conquest
 which had been left imperfect by the first of the Roman
 generals. Instead of being dazzled by vanity or emulation,
 he seriously declared that, unless he were armed with an
 adequate force, he would never consent to risk his own glory
 and that of his sovereign. Justinian granted to the
 favorite what he might have denied to the hero: the Gothic
 war was rekindled from its ashes, and the preparations were
 not unworthy of the ancient majesty of the empire. The key
 of the public treasure was put into his hand, to collect
 magazines, to levy soldiers, to purchase arms and horses, to
 discharge the arrears of pay, and to tempt the fidelity of
 the fugitives and deserters. The troops of Germanus were
 still in arms; they halted at Salona in the expectation of a
 new leader; and legions of subjects and allies were created
 by the well-known liberality of the eunuch Narses. The king
 of the Lombards <small>(<a href="nt430/031.htm">31</a>)</small> satisfied or surpassed the obligations
 of a treaty, by lending two thousand two hundred of his
 bravest warriors, <!-- a HREF="nt430/HXX.htm" (H)/a--> who were followed by three thousand of their martial attendants. Three thousand Heruli fought on
 horseback under Philemuth, their native chief; and the noble
 Aratus, who adopted the manners and discipline of Rome,
 conducted a band of veterans of the same nation. Dagistheus
 was released from prison to command the Huns; and Kobad, the
 grandson and nephew of the great king, was conspicuous by
 the regal tiara at the head of his faithful Persians, who
 had devoted themselves to the fortunes of their prince. <small>(<a href="nt430/032.htm">32</a>)</small>
 Absolute in the exercise of his authority, more absolute in
 the affection of his troops, Narses led a numerous and
 gallant army from Philippopolis to Salona, from whence he
 coasted the eastern side of the Adriatic as far as the
 confines of Italy. His progress was checked. The East
 could not supply vessels capable of transporting such
 multitudes of men and horses. The Franks, who, in the
 general confusion, had usurped the greater part of the
 Venetian province, refused a free passage to the friends of
 the Lombards. The station of Verona was occupied by Teias,
 with the flower of the Gothic forces; and that skilful
 commander had overspread the adjacent country with the fall
 of woods and the inundation of waters. <small>(<a href="nt430/033.htm">33</a>)</small> In this
 perplexity, an officer of experience proposed a measure,
 secure by the appearance of rashness; that the Roman army
 should cautiously advance along the seashore, while the
 fleet preceded their march, and successively cast a bridge
 of boats over the mouths of the rivers, the Timavus, the
 Brenta, the Adige, and the Po, that fall into the Adriatic
 to the north of Ravenna. Nine days he reposed in the city,
 collected the fragments of the Italian army, and marching
 towards Rimini to meet the defiance of an insulting enemy.

</p><p id="defeat"><small class="ok"><i>Defeat and death of Totila, A.D. 552, July.</i></small><br>
 The prudence of Narses impelled him to speedy and decisive
 action. His powers were the last effort of the state; the
 cost of each day accumulated the enormous account; and the
 nations, untrained to discipline or fatigue, might be rashly
 provoked to turn their arms against each other, or against
 their benefactor. The same considerations might have
 tempered the ardor of Totila. But he was conscious that the
 clergy and people of Italy aspired to a second revolution:
 he felt or suspected the rapid progress of treason; and he
 resolved to risk the Gothic kingdom on the chance of a day,
 in which the valiant would be animated by instant danger and
 the disaffected might be awed by mutual ignorance. In his
 march from Ravenna, the Roman general chastised the garrison
 of Rimini, traversed in a direct line the hills of Urbino,
 and reentered the Flaminian way, nine miles beyond the
 perforated rock, an obstacle of art and nature which might
 have stopped or retarded his progress. <small>(<a href="nt430/034.htm">34</a>)</small> The Goths were
 assembled in the neighborhood of Rome, they advanced without delay to seek a superior enemy, and the two armies approached each other at the distance of one hundred furlongs, between Tagina <small>(<a href="nt430/035.htm">35</a>)</small> and the sepulchres of the Gauls. <small>(<a href="nt430/036.htm">36</a>)</small> The haughty message of Narses was an offer, not of peace, but of pardon. The answer of the Gothic king declared his resolution to die or conquer. <em class="on">"What day,"</em> said
 the messenger, <em class="on">"will you fix for the combat?" "The eighth
 day,"</em> replied Totila; but early the next morning he attempted to surprise a foe, suspicious of deceit, and prepared for battle. Ten thousand Heruli and Lombards, of approved valour and doubtful faith, were placed in the centre. Each of the wings was composed of eight thousand Romans; the right was guarded by the cavalry of the Huns, the left was covered by fifteen hundred chosen horse, destined, according to the emergencies of action, to sustain the retreat of their friends, or to encompass the flank of the enemy. From his proper station at the head of the right wing, the eunuch rode along the line, expressing by his voice and countenance the assurance of victory; exciting the soldiers of the emperor to punish the guilt and madness of a
 band of robbers; and exposing to their view gold chains, collars, and bracelets, the rewards of military virtue. From the event of a single combat they drew an omen of success; and they beheld with pleasure the courage of fifty archers, who maintained a small eminence against three successive attacks of the Gothic cavalry. At the distance only of two bow-shots, the armies spent the morning in dreadful suspense, and the Romans tasted some necessary food, without unloosing the cuirass from their breast, or the bridle from their horses. Narses awaited the charge; and it was delayed by Totila till he had received his last succours of two thousand Goths. While he consumed the hours in fruitless treaty, the king exhibited in a narrow space the strength and agility of a warrior. His armour was enchased with gold; his purple banner floated with the wind: he cast his lance into the air; caught it with the right hand; shifted it to the left; threw himself backwards; recovered his seat; and managed a fiery steed in all the paces and evolutions of the equestrian school. As soon as the succours had arrived, he retired to his tent, assumed the dress and arms of a private soldier, and gave the signal of a battle. The first line of cavalry advanced with more courage than discretion, and left behind them the infantry of the second line. They were soon engaged between the horns of a crescent, into which the adverse wings had been insensibly curved, and were saluted
 from either side by the volleys of four thousand archers.
 Their ardor, and even their distress, drove them forwards to
 a close and unequal conflict, in which they could only use
 their lances against an enemy equally skilled in all the
 instruments of war. A generous emulation inspired the
 Romans and their Barbarian allies; and Narses, who calmly
 viewed and directed their efforts, doubted to whom he should
 adjudge the prize of superior bravery. The Gothic cavalry
 was astonished and disordered, pressed and broken; and the
 line of infantry, instead of presenting their spears, or
 opening their intervals, were trampled under the feet of the
 flying horse. Six thousand of the Goths were slaughtered
 without mercy in the field of Tagina. Their prince, with
 five attendants, was overtaken by Asbad, of the race of the
 Gepidae. <em>"Spare the king of Italy,"</em> <!-- a HREF="nt430/IXX.htm" (I)/a--> cried a loyal voice, and Asbad struck his lance through the body of Totila. The blow was instantly revenged by the faithful Goths: they transported their dying monarch seven miles beyond the scene of his disgrace; and his last moments were not embittered by the presence of an enemy. Compassion afforded him the shelter of an obscure tomb; but the Romans were not satisfied of their victory, till they beheld the corpse of the Gothic king. His hat, enriched with gems, and his bloody robe, were presented to Justinian by the messengers of triumph. <small>(<a href="nt430/037.htm">37</a>)</small>

</p><p id="conquest"><small class="ok"><i>Conquest of Rome by Narses.</i></small><br>
 As soon as Narses had paid his devotions to the Author of
 victory, and the blessed Virgin, his peculiar patroness, <small>(<a href="nt430/038.htm">38</a>)</small>
 he praised, rewarded, and dismissed the Lombards. The
 villages had been reduced to ashes by these valiant savages;
 they ravished matrons and virgins on the altar; their
 retreat was diligently watched by a strong detachment of
 regular forces, who prevented a repetition of the like
 disorders. The victorious eunuch pursued his march through
 Tuscany, accepted the submission of the Goths, heard the
 acclamations, and often the complaints, of the Italians, and
 encompassed the walls of Rome with the remainder of his
 formidable host. Round the wide circumference, Narses
 assigned to himself, and to each of his lieutenants, a real
 or a feigned attack, while he silently marked the place of
 easy and unguarded entrance. Neither the fortifications of
 Hadrian's mole, nor of the port, could long delay the
 progress of the conqueror; and Justinian once more received
 the keys of Rome, which, under his reign, had been five
 times taken and recovered. <small>(<a href="nt430/039.htm">39</a>)</small> But the deliverance of Rome
 was the last calamity of the Roman people. The Barbarian
 allies of Narses too frequently confounded the privileges of
 peace and war. The despair of the flying Goths found some
 consolation in sanguinary revenge; and three hundred youths
 of the noblest families, who had been sent as hostages
 beyond the Po, were inhumanly slain by the successor of
 Totila. The fate of the senate suggests an awful lesson of
 the vicissitude of human affairs. Of the senators whom
 Totila had banished from their country, some were rescued by
 an officer of Belisarius, and transported from Campania to
 Sicily; while others were too guilty to confide in the
 clemency of Justinian, or too poor to provide horses for
 their escape to the sea-shore. Their brethren languished
 five years in a state of indigence and exile: the victory of
 Narses revived their hopes; but their premature return to
 the metropolis was prevented by the furious Goths; and all
 the fortresses of Campania were stained with patrician <small>(<a href="nt430/040.htm">40</a>)</small>
 blood. After a period of thirteen centuries, the
 institution of Romulus expired; and if the nobles of Rome
 still assumed the title of senators, few subsequent traces
 can be discovered of a public council, or constitutional
 order. Ascend six hundred years, and contemplate the kings
 of the earth soliciting an audience, as the slaves or
 freedmen of the Roman senate! <small>(<a href="nt430/041.htm">41</a>)</small>

</p><p id="teias"><small class="ok"><i>Defeat and death of Teias, the last king of the Goths, A.D. 553, March.</i></small><br>
 The Gothic war was yet alive. The bravest of the nation
 retired beyond the Po; and Teias was unanimously chosen to
 succeed and revenge their departed hero. The new king
 immediately sent ambassadors to implore, or rather to
 purchase, the aid of the Franks, and nobly lavished, for the
 public safety, the riches which had been deposited in the
 palace of Pavia. The residue of the royal treasure was
 guarded by his brother Aligern, at Cumaea, in Campania; but
 the strong castle which Totila had fortified was closely
 besieged by the arms of Narses. From the Alps to the foot
 of Mount Vesuvius, the Gothic king, by rapid and secret
 marches, advanced to the relief of his brother, eluded the
 vigilance of the Roman chiefs, and pitched his camp on the
 banks of the Sarnus or <I>Draco</I>, <small>(<a href="nt430/042.htm">42</a>)</small> which flows from Nuceria
 into the Bay of Naples. The river separated the two armies:
 sixty days were consumed in distant and fruitless combats,
 and Teias maintained this important post till he was
 deserted by his fleet and the hope of subsistence. With
 reluctant steps he ascended the <I>Lactarian</I> mount, where the
 physicians of Rome, since the time of Galen, had sent their
 patients for the benefit of the air and the milk. <small>(<a href="nt430/043.htm">43</a>)</small> But
 the Goths soon embraced a more generous resolution: to
 descend the hill, to dismiss their horses, and to die in
 arms, and in the possession of freedom. The king marched at
 their head, bearing in his right hand a lance, and an ample
 buckler in his left: with the one he struck dead the
 foremost of the assailants; with the other he received the
 weapons which every hand was ambitious to aim against his
 life. After a combat of many hours, his left arm was
 fatigued by the weight of twelve javelins which hung from
 his shield. Without moving from his ground, or suspending
 his blows, the hero called aloud on his attendants for a
 fresh buckler; but in the moment while his side was
 uncovered, it was pierced by a mortal dart. He fell; and
 his head, exalted on a spear, proclaimed to the nations that
 the Gothic kingdom was no more. But the example of his
 death served only to animate the companions who had sworn to
 perish with their leader. They fought till darkness
 descended on the earth. They reposed on their arms. The
 combat was renewed with the return of light, and maintained
 with unabated vigor till the evening of the second day. The
 repose of a second night, the want of water, and the loss of
 their bravest champions, determined the surviving Goths to
 accept the fair capitulation which the prudence of Narses
 was inclined to propose. They embraced the alternative of
 residing in Italy, as the subjects and soldiers of
 Justinian, or departing with a portion of their private
 wealth, in search of some independent country. <small>(<a href="nt430/044.htm">44</a>)</small> Yet the
 oath of fidelity or exile was alike rejected by one thousand
 Goths, who broke away before the treaty was signed, and
 boldly effected their retreat to the walls of Pavia. The
 spirit, as well as the situation, of Aligern prompted him to
 imitate rather than to bewail his brother: a strong and
 dexterous archer, he transpierced with a single arrow the
 armor and breast of his antagonist; and his military conduct
 defended Cumae <small>(<a href="nt430/045.htm">45</a>)</small> above a year against the forces of the
 Romans. Their industry had scooped the Sibyl's cave <small>(<a href="nt430/046.htm">46</a>)</small> into
 a prodigious mine; combustible materials were introduced to
 consume the temporary props: the wall and the gate of Cumae
 sunk into the cavern, but the ruins formed a deep and
 inaccessible precipice. On the fragment of a rock Aligern
 stood alone and unshaken, till he calmly surveyed the
 hopeless condition of his country, and judged it more
 honorable to be the friend of Narses, than the slave of the
 Franks. After the death of Teias, the Roman general
 separated his troops to reduce the cities of Italy; Lucca
 sustained a long and vigorous siege: and such was the
 humanity or the prudence of Narses, that the repeated
 perfidy of the inhabitants could not provoke him to exact
 the forfeit lives of their hostages. These hostages were
 dismissed in safety; and their grateful zeal at length
 subdued the obstinacy of their countrymen. <small>(<a href="nt430/047.htm">47</a>)</small>

</p><p id="invasion"><small class="ok"><i>Invasion of Italy by the Franks, and Alamanni, A.D. 553, August.</i></small><br>
 Before Lucca had surrendered, Italy was overwhelmed by a new
 deluge of Barbarians. A feeble youth, the grandson of
 Clovis, reigned over the Austrasians or oriental Franks.
 The guardians of Theodebald entertained with coldness and
 reluctance the magnificent promises of the Gothic
 ambassadors. But the spirit of a martial people outstripped
 the timid counsels of the court: two brothers, Lothaire and
 Buccelin, <small>(<a href="nt430/048.htm">48</a>)</small> the dukes of the Alemanni, stood forth as the
 leaders of the Italian war; and seventy-five thousand
 Germans descended in the autumn from the Rhaetian Alps into
 the plain of Milan. The vanguard of the Roman army was
 stationed near the Po, under the conduct of Fulcaris, a bold
 Herulian, who rashly conceived that personal bravery was the
 sole duty and merit of a commander. As he marched without
 order or precaution along the Aemilian way, an ambuscade of
 Franks suddenly rose from the amphitheatre of Parma; his
 troops were surprised and routed; but their leader refused
 to fly; declaring to the last moment, that death was less
 terrible than the angry countenance of Narses. <!-- a HREF="nt430/JXX.htm" (J)/a--> The death
 of Fulcaris, and the retreat of the surviving chiefs,
 decided the fluctuating and rebellious temper of the Goths;
 they flew to the standard of their deliverers, and admitted
 them into the cities which still resisted the arms of the
 Roman general. The conqueror of Italy opened a free passage
 to the irresistible torrent of Barbarians. They passed under
 the walls of Cesena, and answered by threats and reproaches
 the advice of Aligern, <!-- a HREF="nt430/KXX.htm" (K)/a--> that the Gothic treasures could no
 longer repay the labor of an invasion. Two thousand Franks
 were destroyed by the skill and valor of Narses himself, who
 sailed from Rimini at the head of three hundred horse, to
 chastise the licentious rapine of their march. On the
 confines of Samnium the two brothers divided their forces.
 With the right wing, Buccelin assumed the spoil of Campania,
 Lucania, and Bruttium; with the left, Lothaire accepted the
 plunder of Apulia and Calabria. They followed the coast of
 the Mediterranean and the Adriatic, as far as Rhegium and
 Otranto, and the extreme lands of Italy were the term of
 their destructive progress. The Franks, who were Christians
 and Catholics, contented themselves with simple pillage and
 occasional murder. But the churches which their piety had
 spared, were stripped by the sacrilegious hands of the
 Alamanni, who sacrificed horses' heads to their native
 deities of the woods and rivers; <small>(<a href="nt430/049.htm">49</a>)</small> they melted or profaned
 the consecrated vessels, and the ruins of shrines and altars
 were stained with the blood of the faithful. Buccelin was
 actuated by ambition, and Lothaire by avarice. The former
 aspired to restore the Gothic kingdom; the latter, after a
 promise to his brother of speedy succors, returned by the
 same road to deposit his treasure beyond the Alps. The
 strength of their armies was already wasted by the change of
 climate and contagion of disease: the Germans revelled in
 the vintage of Italy; and their own intemperance avenged, in
 some degree, the miseries of a defenceless people. <!-- a HREF="nt430/LXX.htm" (L)/a-->

</p><p id="franks"><small class="ok"><i>Defeat of the Franks and Alamanni by Narses, A.D. 554.</i></small><br>
 At the entrance of the spring, the Imperial troops, who had
 guarded the cities, assembled, to the number of eighteen
 thousand men, in the neighborhood of Rome. Their winter
 hours had not been consumed in idleness. By the command, and
 after the example, of Narses, they repeated each day their
 military exercise on foot and on horseback, accustomed their
 ear to obey the sound of the trumpet, and practised the
 steps and evolutions of the Pyrrhic dance. From the Straits
 of Sicily, Buccelin, with thirty thousand Franks and
 Alamanni, slowly moved towards Capua, occupied with a wooden
 tower the bridge of Casilinum, covered his right by the
 stream of the Vulturnus, and secured the rest of his
 encampment by a rampart of sharp stakes, and a circle of
 wagons, whose wheels were buried in the earth. He
 impatiently expected the return of Lothaire; ignorant, alas!
 that his brother could never return, and that the chief and
 his army had been swept away by a strange disease <small>(<a href="nt430/050.htm">50</a>)</small> on the
 banks of the Lake Benacus, between Trent and Verona. The
 banners of Narses soon approached the Vulturnus, and the
 eyes of Italy were anxiously fixed on the event of this
 final contest. Perhaps the talents of the Roman general
 were most conspicuous in the calm operations which precede
 the tumult of a battle. His skilful movements intercepted
 the subsistence of the Barbarian, deprived him of the
 advantage of the bridge and river, and in the choice of the
 ground and moment of action reduced him to comply with the
 inclination of his enemy. On the morning of the important
 day, when the ranks were already formed, a servant, for some
 trivial fault, was killed by his master, one of the leaders
 of the Heruli. The justice or passion of Narses was
 awakened: he summoned the offender to his presence, and
 without listening to his excuses, gave the signal to the
 minister of death. If the cruel master had not infringed the
 laws of his nation, this arbitrary execution was not less
 unjust than it appears to have been imprudent. The Heruli
 felt the indignity; they halted: but the Roman general,
 without soothing their rage, or expecting their resolution,
 called aloud, as the trumpets sounded, that unless they
 hastened to occupy their place, they would lose the honor of
 the victory. His troops were disposed <small>(<a href="nt430/051.htm">51</a>)</small> in a long front,
 the cavalry on the wings; in the centre, the heavy-armed
 foot; the archers and slingers in the rear. The Germans
 advanced in a sharp-pointed column, of the form of a
 triangle or solid wedge. They pierced the feeble centre of
 Narses, who received them with a smile into the fatal snare,
 and directed his wings of cavalry insensibly to wheel on
 their flanks and encompass their rear. The host of the
 Franks and Alamanni consisted of infantry: a sword and
 buckler hung by their side; and they used, as their weapons
 of offence, a weighty hatchet and a hooked javelin, which
 were only formidable in close combat, or at a short
 distance. The flower of the Roman archers, on horseback, and
 in complete armor, skirmished without peril round this
 immovable phalanx; supplied by active speed the deficiency
 of number; and aimed their arrows against a crowd of
 Barbarians, who, instead of a cuirass and helmet, were
 covered by a loose garment of fur or linen. They paused,
 they trembled, their ranks were confounded, and in the
 decisive moment the Heruli, preferring glory to revenge,
 charged with rapid violence the head of the column. Their
 leader, Sinbal, and Aligern, the Gothic prince, deserved the
 prize of superior valor; and their example excited the
 victorious troops to achieve with swords and spears the
 destruction of the enemy. Buccelin, and the greatest part of
 his army, perished on the field of battle, in the waters of
 the Vulturnus, or by the hands of the enraged peasants: but
 it may seem incredible, that a victory, <small>(<a href="nt430/052.htm">52</a>)</small> which no more
 than five of the Alamanni survived, could be purchased with
 the loss of fourscore Romans. Seven thousand Goths, the
 relics of the war, defended the fortress of Campsa till the
 ensuing spring; and every messenger of Narses announced the
 reduction of the Italian cities, whose names were corrupted
 by the ignorance or vanity of the Greeks. <small>(<a href="nt430/053.htm">53</a>)</small> After the
 battle of Casilinum, Narses entered the capital; the arms
 and treasures of the Goths, the Franks, and the Alamanni,
 were displayed; his soldiers, with garlands in their hands,
 chanted the praises of the conqueror; and Rome, for the last
 time, beheld the semblance of a triumph.

</p><p id="settlement"><small class="ok"><i>Settlement of Italy, A.D. 554-568.</i></small><br>
 After a reign of sixty years, the throne of the Gothic kings
 was filled by the exarchs of Ravenna, the representatives in
 peace and war of the emperor of the Romans. Their
 jurisdiction was soon reduced to the limits of a narrow
 province: but Narses himself, the first and most powerful of
 the exarchs, administered above fifteen years the entire
 kingdom of Italy. Like Belisarius, he had deserved the
 honors of envy, calumny, and disgrace: but the favorite
 eunuch still enjoyed the confidence of Justinian; or the
 leader of a victorious army awed and repressed the
 ingratitude of a timid court. Yet it was not by weak and
 mischievous indulgence that Narses secured the attachment of
 his troops. Forgetful of the past, and regardless of the
 future, they abused the present hour of prosperity and
 peace. The cities of Italy resounded with the noise of
 drinking and dancing; the spoils of victory were wasted in
 sensual pleasures; and nothing (says Agathias) remained
 unless to exchange their shields and helmets for the soft
 lute and the capacious hogshead. <small>(<a href="nt430/054.htm">54</a>)</small> In a manly oration, not
 unworthy of a Roman censor, the eunuch reproved these
 disorderly vices, which sullied their fame, and endangered
 their safety. The soldiers blushed and obeyed; discipline
 was confirmed; the fortifications were restored; a <I>duke</I> was
 stationed for the defence and military command of each of
 the principal cities; <small>(<a href="nt430/055.htm">55</a>)</small> and the eye of Narses pervaded the
 ample prospect from Calabria to the Alps. The remains of
 the Gothic nation evacuated the country, or mingled with the
 people; the Franks, instead of revenging the death of
 Buccelin, abandoned, without a struggle, their Italian
 conquests; and the rebellious Sinbal, chief of the Heruli,
 was subdued, taken and hung on a lofty gallows by the
 inflexible justice of the exarch. <small>(<a href="nt430/056.htm">56</a>)</small> The civil state of
 Italy, after the agitation of a long tempest, was fixed by a
 pragmatic sanction, which the emperor promulgated at the
 request of the pope. Justinian introduced his own
 jurisprudence into the schools and tribunals of the West; he
 ratified the acts of Theodoric and his immediate successors,
 but every deed was rescinded and abolished which force had
 extorted, or fear had subscribed, under the usurpation of
 Totila. A moderate theory was framed to reconcile the
 rights of property with the safety of prescription, the
 claims of the state with the poverty of the people, and the
 pardon of offences with the interest of virtue and order of
 society. Under the exarchs of Ravenna, Rome was degraded to
 the second rank. Yet the senators were gratified by the
 permission of visiting their estates in Italy, and of
 approaching, without obstacle, the throne of Constantinople:
 the regulation of weights and measures was delegated to the
 pope and senate; and the salaries of lawyers and physicians,
 of orators and grammarians, were destined to preserve, or
 rekindle, the light of science in the ancient capital.
 Justinian might dictate benevolent edicts, <small>(<a href="nt430/057.htm">57</a>)</small> and Narses
 might second his wishes by the restoration of cities, and
 more especially of churches. But the power of kings is most
 effectual to destroy; and the twenty years of the Gothic war
 had consummated the distress and depopulation of Italy. As
 early as the fourth campaign, under the discipline of
 Belisarius himself, fifty thousand laborers died of hunger
 <small>(<a href="nt430/058.htm">58</a>)</small> in the narrow region of Picenum; <small>(<a href="nt430/059.htm">59</a>)</small> and a strict
 interpretation of the evidence of Procopius would swell the
 loss of Italy above the total sum of her present
 inhabitants. <small>(<a href="nt430/060.htm">60</a>)</small>

</p><p id="bulgarians"><small class="ok"><i>Invasion of the Bulgarians, A.D. 559.</i></small><br>
 I desire to believe, but I dare not affirm, that Belisarius
 sincerely rejoiced in the triumph of Narses. Yet the
 consciousness of his own exploits might teach him to esteem
 without jealousy the merit of a rival; and the repose of the
 aged warrior was crowned by a last victory, which saved the
 emperor and the capital. The Barbarians, who annually
 visited the provinces of Europe, were less discouraged by
 some accidental defeats, than they were excited by the
 double hope of spoil and of subsidy. In the thirty-second
 winter of Justinian's reign, the Danube was deeply frozen:
 Zabergan led the cavalry of the Bulgarians, and his standard
 was followed by a promiscuous multitude of Sclavonians. <!-- a HREF="nt430/MXX.htm" (M)/a-->
 The savage chief passed, without opposition, the river and
 the mountains, spread his troops over Macedonia and Thrace,
 and advanced with no more than seven thousand horse to the
 long wall, which should have defended the territory of
 Constantinople. But the works of man are impotent against
 the assaults of nature: a recent earthquake had shaken the
 foundations of the wall; and the forces of the empire were
 employed on the distant frontiers of Italy, Africa, and
 Persia. The seven <I>schools</I>, <small>(<a href="nt430/061.htm">61</a>)</small> or companies of the guards or
 domestic troops, had been augmented to the number of five
 thousand five hundred men, whose ordinary station was in the
 peaceful cities of Asia. But the places of the brave
 Armenians were insensibly supplied by lazy citizens, who
 purchased an exemption from the duties of civil life,
 without being exposed to the dangers of military service.
 Of such soldiers, few could be tempted to sally from the
 gates; and none could be persuaded to remain in the field,
 unless they wanted strength and speed to escape from the
 Bulgarians. The report of the fugitives exaggerated the
 numbers and fierceness of an enemy, who had polluted holy
 virgins, and abandoned new-born infants to the dogs and
 vultures; a crowd of rustics, imploring food and protection,
 increased the consternation of the city, and the tents of
 Zabergan were pitched at the distance of twenty miles, <small>(<a href="nt430/062.htm">62</a>)</small>
 on the banks of a small river, which encircles Melanthias,
 and afterwards falls into the Propontis. <small>(<a href="nt430/063.htm">63</a>)</small> Justinian
 trembled: and those who had only seen the emperor in his old
 age, were pleased to suppose, that he had lost the alacrity
 and vigor of his youth. By his command the vessels of gold
 and silver were removed from the churches in the
 neighborhood, and even the suburbs, of Constantinople; the
 ramparts were lined with trembling spectators; the golden
 gate was crowded with useless generals and tribunes, and the
 senate shared the fatigues and the apprehensions of the
 populace.

</p><p id="last"><small class="ok"><i>Last victory of Belisarius.</i></small><br>
 But the eyes of the prince and people were directed to a
 feeble veteran, who was compelled by the public danger to
 resume the armor in which he had entered Carthage and
 defended Rome. The horses of the royal stables, of private
 citizens, and even of the circus, were hastily collected;
 the emulation of the old and young was roused by the name of
 Belisarius, and his first encampment was in the presence of
 a victorious enemy. His prudence, and the labor of the
 friendly peasants, secured, with a ditch and rampart, the
 repose of the night; innumerable fires, and clouds of dust,
 were artfully contrived to magnify the opinion of his
 strength; his soldiers suddenly passed from despondency to
 presumption; and, while ten thousand voices demanded the
 battle, Belisarius dissembled his knowledge, that in the
 hour of trial he must depend on the firmness of three
 hundred veterans. The next morning the Bulgarian cavalry
 advanced to the charge. But they heard the shouts of
 multitudes, they beheld the arms and discipline of the
 front; they were assaulted on the flanks by two ambuscades
 which rose from the woods; their foremost warriors fell by
 the hand of the aged hero and his gnards; and the swiftness
 of their evolutions was rendered useless by the close attack
 and rapid pursuit of the Romans. In this action (so speedy
 was their flight) the Bulgarians lost only four hundred
 horse; but Constantinople was saved; and Zabergan, who felt
 the hand of a master, withdrew to a respectful distance. But
 his friends were numerous in the councils of the emperor,
 and Belisarius obeyed with reluctance the commands of envy
 and Justinian, which forbade him to achieve the deliverance
 of his country. On his return to the city, the people,
 still conscious of their danger, accompanied his triumph
 with acclamations of joy and gratitude, which were imputed
 as a crime to the victorious general. But when he entered
 the palace, the courtiers were silent, and the emperor,
 after a cold and thankless embrace, dismissed him to mingle
 with the train of slaves. Yet so deep was the impression of
 his glory on the minds of men, that Justinian, in the
 seventy-seventh year of his age, was encouraged to advance
 near forty miles from the capital, and to inspect in person
 the restoration of the long wall. The Bulgarians wasted the
 summer in the plains of Thrace; but they were inclined to
 peace by the failure of their rash attempts on Greece and
 the Chersonesus. A menace of killing their prisoners
 quickened the payment of heavy ransoms; and the departure of
 Zabergan was hastened by the report, that double-prowed
 vessels were built on the Danube to intercept his passage.
 The danger was soon forgotten; and a vain question, whether
 their sovereign had shown more wisdom or weakness, amused
 the idleness of the city. <small>(<a href="nt430/064.htm">64</a>)</small>

</p><p id="disgrace"><small class="ok"><i>His disgrace and death, A.D. 561.</i></small><br>
 About two years after the last victory of Belisarius, the
 emperor returned from a Thracian journey of health, or
 business, or devotion. Justinian was afflicted by a pain in
 his head; and his private entry countenanced the rumor of
 his death. Before the third hour of the day, the bakers'
 shops were plundered of their bread, the houses were shut,
 and every citizen, with hope or terror, prepared for the
 impending tumult. The senators themselves, fearful and
 suspicious, were convened at the ninth hour; and the
 praefect received their commands to visit every quarter of
 the city, and proclaim a general illumination for the
 recovery of the emperor's health. The ferment subsided; but
 every accident betrayed the impotence of the government, and
 the factious temper of the people: the guards were disposed
 to mutiny as often as their quarters were changed, or their
 pay was withheld: the frequent calamities of fires and
 earthquakes afforded the opportunities of disorder; the
 disputes of the blues and greens, of the orthodox and
 heretics, degenerated into bloody battles; and, in the
 presence of the Persian ambassador, Justinian blushed for
 himself and for his subjects. Capricious pardon and
 arbitrary punishment imbittered the irksomeness and
 discontent of a long reign: a conspiracy was formed in the
 palace; and, unless we are deceived by the names of
 Marcellus and Sergius, the most virtuous and the most
 profligate of the courtiers were associated in the same
 designs. They had fixed the time of the execution; their
 rank gave them access to the royal banquet; and their black
 slaves <small>(<a href="nt430/065.htm">65</a>)</small> were stationed in the vestibule and porticos, to
 announce the death of the tyrant, and to excite a sedition
 in the capital. But the indiscretion of an accomplice saved
 the poor remnant of the days of Justinian. The conspirators
 were detected and seized, with daggers hidden under their
 garments: Marcellus died by his own hand, and Sergius was
 dragged from the sanctuary. <small>(<a href="nt430/066.htm">66</a>)</small> Pressed by remorse, or
 tempted by the hopes of safety, he accused two officers of
 the household of Belisarius; and torture forced them to
 declare that they had acted according to the secret
 instructions of their patron. <small>(<a href="nt430/067.htm">67</a>)</small> Posterity will not hastily
 believe that a hero who, in the vigor of life, had disdained
 the fairest offers of ambition and revenge, should stoop to
 the murder of his prince, whom he could not long expect to
 survive. His followers were impatient to fly; <small><I> A.D. 563, December 5.</i></small> but flight
 must have been supported by rebellion, and he had lived
 enough for nature and for glory. Belisarius appeared before
 the council with less fear than indignation: after forty
 years' service, the emperor had prejudged his guilt; and
 injustice was sanctified by the presence and authority of
 the patriarch. The life of Belisarius was graciously
 spared; but his fortunes were sequestered, and, from
 December to July, <small><I> A.D. 564, July 19.</i></small> he was guarded as a prisoner in his own
 palace. At length his innocence was acknowledged; his
 freedom and honor were restored; and death, which might be
 hastened by resentment and grief, removed him from the world
 in about eight months after his deliverance. <small><I> A.D. 565, March 13.</i></small> The name of
 Belisarius can never die but instead of the funeral, the
 monuments, the statues, so justly due to his memory, I only
 read, that his treasures, the spoil of the Goths and
 Vandals, were immediately confiscated by the emperor. Some decent portion was reserved, however for the use of his widow: and as Antonina had much to repent, she devoted the last remains of her life and fortune to the foundation of a convent. Such is the simple and genuine narrative of the
 fall of Belisarius and the ingratitude of Justinian. <small>(<a href="nt430/068.htm">68</a>)</small> That he was deprived of his eyes, and reduced by envy to beg his bread, <!-- a HREF="nt430/NXX.htm" (N)/a--> <em>"Give a penny to Belisarius the general!"</em> is a fiction of later times, <small>(<a href="nt430/069.htm">69</a>)</small> which has obtained credit, or rather favor, as a strange example of the vicissitudes of fortune. <small>(<a href="nt430/070.htm">70</a>)</small>

</p><p id="death"><small class="ok"><i>Death and character of Justinian, A.D. 565, Nov. 14.</i></small><br>
 If the emperor could rejoice in the death of Belisarius, he enjoyed the base satisfaction only eight months, the last period of a reign of thirty- eight years, and a life of eighty-three years. It would be difficult to trace the
 character of a prince who is not the most conspicuous object of his own times: but the confessions of an enemy may be received as the safest evidence of his virtues. The resemblance of Justinian to the bust of Domitian, is
 maliciously urged; <small>(<a href="nt430/071.htm">71</a>)</small> with the acknowledgment, however, of a well-proportioned figure, a ruddy complexion, and a pleasing countenance. The emperor was easy of access, patient of hearing, courteous and affable in discourse, and a master of the angry passions which rage with such destructive violence in the breast of a despot. Procopius praises his temper, to reproach him with calm and deliberate cruelty: but in the conspiracies which attacked his authority and person, a more candid judge will approve the justice, or admire the clemency, of Justinian. He excelled in the private virtues of chastity and temperance: but the impartial love of beauty would have been less mischievous than his conjugal tenderness for Theodora; and his abstemious diet was regulated, not by the prudence of a philosopher, but the superstition of a monk. His repasts
 were short and frugal: on solemn fasts, he contented himself with water and vegetables; and such was his strength, as well as fervour, that he frequently passed two days, and as
 many nights, without tasting any food. The measure of his
 sleep was not less rigorous: after the repose of a single
 hour, the body was awakened by the soul, and, to the
 astonishment of his chamberlain, Justinian walked or studied
 till the morning light. Such restless application prolonged
 his time for the acquisition of knowledge <small>(<a href="nt430/072.htm">72</a>)</small> and the
 despatch of business; and he might seriously deserve the
 reproach of confounding, by minute and preposterous
 diligence, the general order of his administration. The
 emperor professed himself a musician and architect, a poet
 and philosopher, a lawyer and theologian; and if he failed
 in the enterprise of reconciling the Christian sects, the
 review of the Roman jurisprudence is a noble monument of his
 spirit and industry. In the government of the empire, he
 was less wise, or less successful: the age was unfortunate;
 the people was oppressed and discontented; Theodora abused
 her power; a succession of bad ministers disgraced his
 judgment; and Justinian was neither beloved in his life, nor
 regretted at his death. The love of fame was deeply
 implanted in his breast, but he condescended to the poor
 ambition of titles, honors, and contemporary praise; and
 while he labored to fix the admiration, he forfeited the
 esteem and affection, of the Romans. The design of the
 African and Italian wars was boldly conceived and executed;
 and his penetration discovered the talents of Belisarius in
 the camp, of Narses in the palace. But the name of the
 emperor is eclipsed by the names of his victorious generals;
 and Belisarius still lives, to upbraid the envy and
 ingratitude of his sovereign. The partial favor of mankind
 applauds the genius of a conqueror, who leads and directs
 his subjects in the exercise of arms. The characters of
 Philip the Second and of Justinian are distinguished by the
 cold ambition which delights in war, and declines the
 dangers of the field. Yet a colossal statue of bronze
 represented the emperor on horseback, preparing to march
 against the Persians in the habit and armor of Achilles. In
 the great square before the church of St. Sophia, this
 monument was raised on a brass column and a stone pedestal
 of seven steps; and the pillar of Theodosius, which weighed
 seven thousand four hundred pounds of silver, was removed
 from the same place by the avarice and vanity of Justinian.
 Future princes were more just or indulgent to his memory;
 the elder Andronicus, in the beginning of the fourteenth
 century, repaired and beautified his equestrian statue:
 since the fall of the empire it has been melted into cannon
 by the victorious Turks. <small>(<a href="nt430/073.htm">73</a>)</small>
 
 </p><p> I shall conclude this chapter with the comets, the
 earthquakes, and the plague, which astonished or afflicted
 the age of Justinian. 

</p><p id="comets"><small class="ok"><i>Comets, A.D. 531, 539.</i></small><br>
<b>I.</b> In the fifth year of his reign,
 and in the month of September, a comet <small>(<a href="nt430/074.htm">74</a>)</small> was seen during
 twenty days in the western quarter of the heavens, and which
 shot its rays into the north. Eight years afterwards, while
 the sun was in Capricorn, another comet appeared to follow
 in the Sagittary; the size was gradually increasing; the
 head was in the east, the tail in the west, and it remained
 visible above forty days. The nations, who gazed with
 astonishment, expected wars and calamities from their
 baleful influence; and these expectations were abundantly
 fulfilled. The astronomers dissembled their ignorance of
 the nature of these blazing stars, which they affected to
 represent as the floating meteors of the air; and few among
 them embraced the simple notion of Seneca and the Chaldeans,
 that they are only planets of a longer period and more
 eccentric motion. <small>(<a href="nt430/075.htm">75</a>)</small> Time and science have justified the
 conjectures and predictions of the Roman sage: the telescope
 has opened new worlds to the eyes of astronomers; <small>(<a href="nt430/076.htm">76</a>)</small> and,
 in the narrow space of history and fable, one and the same
 comet is already found to have revisited the earth in <I>seven</I>
 equal revolutions of five hundred and seventy-five years.
 The <I>first</I>, <small>(<a href="nt430/077.htm">77</a>)</small> which ascends beyond the Christian aera one
 thousand seven hundred and sixty-seven years, is coeval with
 Ogyges, the father of Grecian antiquity. And this appearance
 explains the tradition which Varro has preserved, that under
 his reign the planet Venus changed her color, size, figure,
 and course; a prodigy without example either in past or
 succeeding ages. <small>(<a href="nt430/078.htm">78</a>)</small> The <I>second</I> visit, in the year eleven
 hundred and ninety-three, is darkly implied in the fable of
 Electra, the seventh of the Pleiads, who have been reduced
 to six since the time of the Trojan war. That nymph, the
 wife of Dardanus, was unable to support the ruin of her
 country: she abandoned the dances of her sister orbs, fled
 from the zodiac to the north pole, and obtained, from her
 dishevelled locks, the name of the <I>comet</I>. The <I>third</I> period
 expires in the year six hundred and eighteen, a date that
 exactly agrees with the tremendous comet of the Sibyl, and
 perhaps of Pliny, which arose in the West two generations
 before the reign of Cyrus. The <I>fourth</I> apparition,
 forty-four years before the birth of Christ, is of all
 others the most splendid and important. After the death of
 Caesar, a long-haired star was conspicuous to Rome and to
 the nations, during the games which were exhibited by young
 Octavian in honor of Venus and his uncle. The vulgar
 opinion, that it conveyed to heaven the divine soul of the
 dictator, was cherished and consecrated by the piety of a
 statesman; while his secret superstition referred the comet
 to the glory of his own times. <small>(<a href="nt430/079.htm">79</a>)</small> The <I>fifth</I> visit has been
 already ascribed to the fifth year of Justinian, which
 coincides with the five hundred and thirty-first of the
 Christian aera. And it may deserve notice, that in this, as
 in the preceding instance, the comet was followed, though at
 a longer interval, by a remarkable paleness of the sun. The
 <I>sixth</I> return, in the year eleven hundred and six, is
 recorded by the chronicles of Europe and China: and in the
 first fervor of the crusades, the Christians and the Mahometans might surmise, with equal reason, that it portended the destruction of the Infidels. The <I>seventh</I> phenomenon, of one thousand six hundred and eighty, was presented to the eyes of an enlightened age. <small>(<a href="nt430/080.htm">80</a>)</small> The philosophy of Bayle dispelled a prejudice which Milton's muse had so recently adorned, that the comet, "<i>from its horrid hair shakes pestilence and war</i>." <small>(<a href="nt430/081.htm">81</a>)</small> Its road in the heavens was observed with exquisite skill by Flamstead and Cassini: and the mathematical science of Bernoulli, Newton <!-- a HREF="nt430/OXX.htm" (O)/a-->, and Halley, investigated the laws of its revolutions. At the <I>eighth</I> period, in the year two thousand three hundred and fifty-five, their calculations may perhaps be verified by the astronomers of some future capital in the Siberian or American wilderness.

</p><p id="earthquakes"><small class="ok"><i>Earthquakes.</i></small><br>
 <B> II</b>. The near approach of a comet may injure or destroy the
 globe which we inhabit; but the changes on its surface have
 been hitherto produced by the action of volcanoes and
 earthquakes. <small>(<a href="nt430/082.htm">82</a>)</small> The nature of the soil may indicate the countries most exposed to these formidable concussions,
 since they are caused by subterraneous fires, and such fires
 are kindled by the union and fermentation of iron and
 sulphur. But their times and effects appear to lie beyond
 the reach of human curiosity; and the philosopher will
 discreetly abstain from the prediction of earthquakes, till
 he has counted the drops of water that silently filtrate on
 the inflammable mineral, and measured the caverns which
 increase by resistance the explosion of the imprisoned air.
 Without assigning the cause, history will distinguish the
 periods in which these calamitous events have been rare or
 frequent, and will observe, that this fever of the earth
 raged with uncommon violence during the reign of Justinian.
 <small>(<a href="nt430/083.htm">83</a>)</small> Each year is marked by the repetition of earthquakes, of
 such duration, that Constantinople has been shaken above
 forty days; of such extent, that the shock has been
 communicated to the whole surface of the globe, or at least
 of the Roman empire. An impulsive or vibratory motion was
 felt: enormous chasms were opened, huge and heavy bodies
 were discharged into the air, the sea alternately advanced
 and retreated beyond its ordinary bounds, and a mountain was
 torn from Libanus, <small>(<a href="nt430/084.htm">84</a>)</small> and cast into the waves, where it
 protected, as a mole, the new harbor of Botrys <small>(<a href="nt430/085.htm">85</a>)</small> in Phoenicia. The stroke that agitates an ant-hill may crush the insect-myriads in the dust; yet truth must extort confession that man has industriously laboured for his own destruction. The institution of great cities, which include a nation within the limits of a wall, almost realizes the wish of Caligula, that the Roman people had but one neck. Two hundred and fifty thousand <sup><i>A.D. 526, May 20.</i></sup> persons are said to have perished in the earthquake of Antioch, whose domestic multitudes were swelled by the conflux of strangers to the festival of the Ascension. <small><I>A.D. 551, July 9.</i></small>The loss of Berytus <small>(<a href="nt430/086.htm">86</a>)</small> was of smaller account, but of much greater value. That city, on the coast of Phoenicia, was illustrated by the study of the civil law, which opened the surest road to wealth and dignity: the schools of Berytus were filled with the rising spirits of the age, and many a youth was lost in the earthquake, who might have lived to be the scourge or the guardian of his country. In these disasters, the architect
 becomes the enemy of mankind. The hut of a savage, or the tent of an Arab, may be thrown down without injury to the inhabitant; and the Peruvians had reason to deride the folly of their Spanish conquerors, who with so much cost and labour erected their own sepulchres. The rich marbles of a patrician are dashed on his own head: a whole people is buried under the ruins of public and private edifices, and the conflagration is kindled and propagated by the innumerable fires which are necessary for the subsistence and manufactures of a great city. Instead of the mutual sympathy which might comfort and assist the distressed, they dreadfully experience the vices and passions which are
 released from the fear of punishment: the tottering houses are pillaged by intrepid avarice; revenge embraces the moment, and selects the victim; and the earth often swallows the assassin, or the ravisher, in the consummation of their crimes. Superstition involves the present danger with invisible terrors; and if the image of death may sometimes be subservient to the virtue or repentance of individuals, an affrighted people is more forcibly moved to expect the end of the world, or to deprecate with servile homage the wrath of an avenging Deity.
</p><p id="plague"><small class="ok"><i>Plague its origins and nature, A.D. 542.</i></small><br> <b>III</b>. Aethiopia and Egypt have been stigmatised, in every
 age, as the original source and seminary of the plague. <small>(<a href="nt430/087.htm">87</a>)</small>
 In a damp, hot, stagnating air, this African fever is
 generated from the putrefaction of animal substances, and
 especially from the swarms of locusts, not less destructive
 to mankind in their death than in their lives. The fatal
 disease which depopulated the earth in the time of Justinian
 and his successors, <small>(<a href="nt430/088.htm">88</a>)</small> first appeared in the neighborhood
 of Pelusium, between the Serbonian bog and the eastern
 channel of the Nile. From thence, tracing as it were a
 double path, it spread to the East, over Syria, Persia, and
 the Indies, and penetrated to the West, along the coast of
 Africa, and over the continent of Europe. In the spring of
 the second year, Constantinople, during three or four
 months, was visited by the pestilence; and Procopius, who
 observed its progress and symptoms with the eyes of a
 physician, <small>(<a href="nt430/089.htm">89</a>)</small> has emulated the skill and diligence of
 Thucydides in the description of the plague of Athens. <small>(<a href="nt430/090.htm">90</a>)</small>
 The infection was sometimes announced by the visions of a
 distempered fancy, and the victim despaired as soon as he
 had heard the menace and felt the stroke of an invisible
 spectre. But the greater number, in their beds, in the
 streets, in their usual occupation, were surprised by a
 slight fever; so slight, indeed, that neither the pulse nor
 the color of the patient gave any signs of the approaching
 danger. The same, the next, or the succeeding day, it was
 declared by the swelling of the glands, particularly those
 of the groin, of the armpits, and under the ear; and when
 these buboes or tumors were opened, they were found to
 contain a coal, or black substance, of the size of a lentil.
 If they came to a just swelling and suppuration, the patient
 was saved by this kind and natural discharge of the morbid
 humor. But if they continued hard and dry, a mortification
 quickly ensued, and the fifth day was commonly the term of
 his life. The fever was often accompanied with lethargy or
 delirium; the bodies of the sick were covered with black
 pustules or carbuncles, the symptoms of immediate death; and
 in the constitutions too feeble to produce an irruption, the
 vomiting of blood was followed by a mortification of the
 bowels. To pregnant women the plague was generally mortal:
 yet one infant was drawn alive from his dead mother, and
 three mothers survived the loss of their infected foetus.
 Youth was the most perilous season; and the female sex was
 less susceptible than the male: but every rank and
 profession was attacked with indiscriminate rage, and many
 of those who escaped were deprived of the use of their
 speech, without being secure from a return of the disorder.
 <small>(<a href="nt430/091.htm">91</a>)</small> The physicians of Constantinople were zealous and
 skilful; but their art was baffled by the various symptoms
 and pertinacious vehemence of the disease: the same remedies
 were productive of contrary effects, and the event
 capriciously disappointed their prognostics of death or
 recovery. The order of funerals, and the right of
 sepulchres, were confounded: those who were left without
 friends or servants, lay unburied in the streets, or in
 their desolate houses; and a magistrate was authorized to
 collect the promiscuous heaps of dead bodies, to transport
 them by land or water, and to inter them in deep pits beyond
 the precincts of the city. Their own danger, and the
 prospect of public distress, awakened some remorse in the
 minds of the most vicious of mankind: the confidence of
 health again revived their passions and habits; but
 philosophy must disdain the observation of Procopius, that
 the lives of such men were guarded by the peculiar favor of
 fortune or Providence. He forgot, or perhaps he secretly
 recollected, that the plague had touched the person of
 Justinian himself; but the abstemious diet of the emperor
 may suggest, as in the case of Socrates, a more rational and
 honorable cause for his recovery. <small>(<a href="nt430/092.htm">92</a>)</small> During his sickness,
 the public consternation was expressed in the habits of the
 citizens; and their idleness and despondence occasioned a
 general scarcity in the capital of the East.

</p><p id="extent"><small class="ok"><i>Extent and duration, A.D. 542-594.</i></small><br> Contagion is the inseparable symptom of the plague; which,
 by mutual respiration, is transfused from the infected
 persons to the lungs and stomach of those who approach them.
 While philosophers believe and tremble, it is singular, that
 the existence of a real danger should have been denied by a
 people most prone to vain and imaginary terrors. <small>(<a href="nt430/093.htm">93</a>)</small> Yet the
 fellow-citizens of Procopius were satisfied, by some short
 and partial experience, that the infection could not be
 gained by the closest conversation: <small>(<a href="nt430/094.htm">94</a>)</small> and this persuasion
 might support the assiduity of friends or physicians in the
 care of the sick, whom inhuman prudence would have condemned
 to solitude and despair. But the fatal security, like the
 predestination of the Turks, must have aided the progress of
 the contagion; and those salutary precautions to which
 Europe is indebted for her safety, were unknown to the
 government of Justinian. No restraints were imposed on the
 free and frequent intercourse of the Roman provinces: from
 Persia to France, the nations were mingled and infected by
 wars and emigrations; and the pestilential odor which lurks
 for years in a bale of cotton was imported, by the abuse of
 trade, into the most distant regions. The mode of its
 propagation is explained by the remark of Procopius himself,
 that it always spread from the sea-coast to the inland
 country: the most sequestered islands and mountains were
 successively visited; the places which had escaped the fury
 of its first passage were alone exposed to the contagion of
 the ensuing year. The winds might diffuse that subtile
 venom; but unless the atmosphere be previously disposed for
 its reception, the plague would soon expire in the cold or
 temperate climates of the earth. Such was the universal
 corruption of the air, that the pestilence which burst forth
 in the fifteenth year of Justinian was not checked or
 alleviated by any difference of the seasons. In time, its
 first malignity was abated and dispersed; the disease
 alternately languished and revived; but it was not till the
 end of a calamitous period of fifty-two years, that mankind
 recovered their health, or the air resumed its pure and
 salubrious quality. No facts have been preserved to sustain
 an account, or even a conjecture, of the numbers that
 perished in this extraordinary mortality. I only find, that
 during three months, five, and at length ten, thousand
 persons died each day at Constantinople; that many cities of
 the East were left vacant, and that in several districts of
 Italy the harvest and the vintage withered on the ground.
 The triple scourge of war, pestilence, and famine, afflicted
 the subjects of Justinian; and his reign is disgraced by the
 visible decrease of the human species, which has never been
 repaired in some of the fairest countries of the globe. <small>(<a href="nt430/095.htm">95</a>)</small>
