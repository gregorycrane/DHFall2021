<p>THE unfortunate Licinius was the last rival who opposed the greatness, and the last captive who adorned the triumph, of Constantine. After a tranquil and prosperous reign the conqueror bequeathed to his family the inheritance of the Roman empire; a new capital, a new policy, and a new religion; and the innovations which he established have been embraced and consecrated by succeeding generations. The age of the great Constantine and his sons is filled with important events; but the historian must be oppressed by their number and variety, unless he diligently separates from each other the scenes which are connected only by the order of time. He will describe the political institutions  that gave strength and stability to the empire before he proceeds to relate the wars and revolutions which hastened its decline. He will adopt the division unknown to the ancients of civil and ecclesiastical affairs: the victory of  the Christians and their intestine discord, will supply copious and distinct materials both for edification and for scandal.</p>
 
<p id="desi"><small class="ok">Design of a new capital. A.D. 324</small><br>
 
After the defeat and abdication of Licinius his victorious
 rival proceeded to lay the foundations of a city destined to
 reign in future times the mistress of the East, and to
 survive the empire and religion of Constantine. The motives,
 whether of pride or of policy, which first induced
 Diocletian to withdraw himself from the ancient seat of
 government, had acquired additional weight by the example of
 his successors and the habits of forty years. Rome was
 insensibly confounded with the dependent kingdoms which had
 once acknowledged her supremacy; and the country of the
 Caesars was viewed with cold indifference by a martial
 prince, born in the neighbourhood of the Danube, educated in
 the courts and armies of Asia, and invested with the purple
 by the legions of Britain. The Italians, who had received
 Constantine as their deliverer, submissively obeyed the
 edicts which he sometimes condescended to address to the
 senate and people of Rome; but they were seldom honoured
 with the presence of their new sovereign. During the vigour
 of his age Constantine, according to the various exigencies
 of peace and war, moved with slow dignity or with active
 diligence along the frontiers of his extensive dominions;
 and was always prepared to take the field either against a
 foreign or a domestic enemy. But as he gradually reached the
 summit of prosperity and the decline of life, he began to
 meditate the design of fixing in a more permanent station
 the strength as well as majesty of the throne. In the choice
 of an advantageous situation he preferred the confines of
 Europe and Asia; to curb with a powerful arm the barbarians
 who dwelt between the Danube and the Tanais; to watch with
 an eye of jealousy the conduct of the Persian monarch, who
 indignantly supported the yoke of an ignominious treaty.
 With these views Diocletian had selected and embellished the
 residence of Nicomedia: but the memory of Diocletian was
 justly abhorred by the protector of the church; and
 Constantine was not insensible to the ambition of founding a
 city which might perpetuate the glory of his own name.
 During the late operations of the war against Licinius he
 had sufficient opportunity to contemplate, both as a soldier
 and as a statesman, <sup id="situ"><i>Situation of Byzantium</i></sup> the incomparable position of Byzantium;
 and to observe how strongly it was guarded by nature against
 an hostile attack, whilst it was accessible on every side to
 the benefits of commercial intercourse. Many ages before
 Constantine, one of the most judicious historians of
 antiquity <small>(<a href="nt17/001.htm">1</a>)</small> had described the advantages of a situation from 
 whence a feeble colony of Greeks derived the command of the
 sea, and the honours of a flourishing and independent
 republic. <small>(<a href="nt17/002.htm">2</a>)</small></p>
 
<p id="desc"><small class="ok">Description of CONSTANTINOPLE</small><br>
 
 If we survey Byzantium in the extent which it acquired with
 the august name of Constantinople, the figure of the
 Imperial city may be represented under that of an unequal
 triangle. The obtuse point, which advances towards the east
 and the shores of Asia, meets and repels the waves of the
 Thracian Bosphorus. The northern side of the city is bounded
 by the harbour, and the southern is washed by the Propontis
 or Sea of Marmora. The basis of the triangle is opposed to
 the west, and terminates the continent of Europe. But the
 admirable form and division of the circumjacent land and
 water cannot, without a more ample explanation, be clearly
 or sufficiently understood.
 
</p><p id="theb"><small class="ok">The Bosphorus</small><br>
 
 The winding channel through which the waters of the Euxine
 flow with a rapid and incessant course towards the
 Mediterranean received the appellation of Bosphorus, a name
 not less celebrated in the history than in the fables of
 antiquity. <small>(<a href="nt17/003.htm">3</a>)</small> A crowd of temples and of votive altars, 
 profusely scattered along its steep and woody banks,
 attested the unskilfulness, the terrors, and the devotion of
 the Grecian navigators who, after the example of the
 Argonauts, explored the dangers of the inhospitable Euxine.
 On these banks tradition long preserved the memory of the
 palace of Phineus, infested by the obscene harpies; <small>(<a href="nt17/004.htm">4</a>)</small> and of 
 the sylvan reign of Amycus, who defied the son of Leda to
 the combat of the Cestus. <small>(<a href="nt17/005.htm">5</a>)</small> The straits of the Bosphorus are 
 terminated by the Cyanean rocks, which, according to the
 description of the poets, had once floated on the face of
 the waters, and were destined by the gods to protect the
 entrance of the Euxine against the eye of profane curiosity.
  <small>(<a href="nt17/006.htm">6</a>)</small> From the Cyanean rocks to the point and harbour of 
 Byzantium the winding length of the Bosphorus extends about
 sixteen miles, <small>(<a href="nt17/007.htm">7</a>)</small> and its most ordinary breadth may be 
 computed at about one mile and a half. The <i>new</i> castles of
 Europe and Asia are constructed, on either continent, upon
 the foundations of two celebrated temples, of Serapis and of
 Jupiter Urius. The <i>old</i> castles, a work of the Greek emperors
 command the narrowest part of the channel, in a place where
 the opposite banks advance within five hundred paces of each
 other. These fortresses were restored and strengthened by
 Mahomet the Second when he meditated the siege of
 Constantinople: <small>(<a href="nt17/008.htm">8</a>)</small> but the Turkish conqueror was most 
 probably ignorant that, near two thousand years before his
 reign, Darius had chosen the same situation to connect the
 two continents by a bridge of boats. <small>(<a href="nt17/009.htm">9</a>)</small> At a small distance 
 from the old castles we discover the little town of
 Chrysopolis, or Scutari, which may almost be considered as
 the Asiatic suburb of Constantinople. The Bosphorus, as it
 begins to open into the Propontis, passes between Byzantium
 and Chalcedon. The latter of those cities was built by the
 Greeks a few years before the former; and the blindness of
 its founders, who overlooked the superior advantages of the
 opposite coast, has been stigmatised by a proverbial
 expression of contempt. <small>(<a href="nt17/010.htm">10</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="thep"><small class="ok">The Port</small><br>
 
 The harbour of Constantinople, which may be considered as an
 arm of the Bosphorus, obtained, in a very remote period, the
 denomination of the <i> Golden Horn</i>. The curve which it
 describes might be compared to the horn of a stag, or as it
 should seem, with more propriety, to that of an ox. <small>(<a href="nt17/011.htm">11</a>)</small> The 
 epithet of <i>golden</i> was expressive of the riches which every
 wind wafted from the most distant countries into the secure
 and capacious port of Constantinople. The river Lycus,
 formed by the conflux of two little streams, pours into the
 harbour a perpetual supply of fresh water, which serves to
 cleanse the bottom and to invite the periodical shoals of
 fish to seek their retreat in that convenient recess. As the
 vicissitudes of tides are scarcely felt in those seas, the
 constant depth of the harbour allows goods to be landed on
 the quays without the assistance of boats; and it has been
 observed that, in many places, the largest vessels may rest
 their prows against the houses while their sterns are
 floating in the water. <small>(<a href="nt17/012.htm">12</a>)</small> From the mouth of the Lycus to 
 that of the harbour this arm of the Bosphorus is more than
 seven miles in length. The entrance is about five hundred
 yards broad, and a strong chain could be occasionally drawn
 across it to guard the port and city from the attack of an
 hostile navy. <small>(<a href="nt17/013.htm">13</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="thepr"><small class="ok">The Propontis</small><br>
 
Between the Bosphorus and the Hellespont, the shores of
 Europe and Asia receding on either side inclose the Sea of
 Marmora, which was known to the ancients by the denomination
 of Propontis. The navigation from the issue of the Bosphorus
 to the entrance of the Hellespont is about one hundred and
 twenty miles. Those who steer their westward course through
 the middle of the Propontis may at once descry the high
 lands of Thrace and Bithynia, and never lose sight of the
 lofty summit of Mount Olympus, covered with eternal snows.
  <small>(<a href="nt17/014.htm">14</a>)</small> They leave on the left a deep gulf, at the bottom of 
 which Nicomedia was seated, the Imperial residence of
 Diocletian; and they pass the small islands of Cyzicus and
 Proconnesus before they cast anchor at Gallipoli, where the
 sea, which separates Asia from Europe, is again contracted
 into a narrow channel.
 
</p><p id="thehe"><small class="ok">The Hellespont</small><br>
 
 The geographers who, with the most skilful accuracy, have
 surveyed the form and extent of the Hellespont, assign about
 sixty miles for the winding course, and about three miles
 for the ordinary breadth, of those celebrated straits. <small>(<a href="nt17/015.htm">15</a>)</small> 
 But the narrowest part of the channel is found to the
 northward of the old Turkish castles, between the cities of
 Sestus and Abydus. It was here that the adventurous Leander
 braved the passage of the flood for the possession of his
 mistress. <small>(<a href="nt17/016.htm">16</a>)</small> It was here likewise, in a place where the 
 distance between the opposite banks cannot exceed five
 hundred paces, that Xerxes imposed a stupendous bridge of
 boats, for the purpose of transporting into Europe a hundred
 and seventy myriads of barbarians. <small>(<a href="nt17/017.htm">17</a>)</small> A sea contracted 
 within such narrow limit may seem but ill to deserve the
 singular epithet of <i>broad</i>, which Homer, as well as Orpheus,
 has frequently bestowed on the Hellespont. But our ideas of
 greatness are of a relative nature: the traveller, and
 especially the poet, who sailed along the Hellespont, who
 pursued the windings of the stream, and contemplated the
 rural scenery, which appeared on every side to terminate the
 prospect, insensibly lost the remembrance of the sea; and
 his fancy painted those celebrated straits with all the
 attributes of a mighty river, flowing with a swift current,
 in the midst of a woody and inland country, and at length,
 through a wide mouth, discharging itself into the Aegean or
 Archipelago. <small>(<a href="nt17/018.htm">18</a>)</small> Ancient Troy, <small>(<a href="nt17/019.htm">19</a>)</small> seated on an eminence at 
 the foot of Mount Ida, overlooked the mouth of the
 Hellespont, which scarcely received an accession of waters
 from the tribute of those immortal rivulets the Simois and
 Scamander. The Grecian camp had stretched twelve miles along
 the shore, from the Sigean to the Rhoetean promontory; and
 the flanks of the army were guarded by the bravest chiefs
 who fought under the banners of Agamemnon. The first of
 those promontories was occupied by Achilles with his
 invincible myrmidons, and the dauntless Ajax pitched his
 tents on the other. After Ajax had fallen a sacrifice to his
 disappointed pride and to the ingratitude of the Greeks, his
 sepulchre was created on the ground where he had defended
 the navy against the rage of Jove and Hector; and the
 citizens of the rising town of Rhoeteum celebrated his
 memory with divine honours. <small>(<a href="nt17/020.htm">20</a>)</small> Before Constantine gave a 
 just preference to the situation of Byzantium, he had
 conceived the design of erecting the seat of empire on this
 celebrated spot, from whence the Romans derived their
 fabulous origin. The extensive plain which lies below
 ancient Troy, towards the Rhoetean promontory and the tomb
 of Ajax, was first chosen for his new capital; and, though
 the undertaking was soon relinquished, the stately remains
 of unfinished walls and towers attracted the notice of all
 who sailed through the straits of the Hellespont. <small>(<a href="nt17/021.htm">21</a>)</small> 

</p><p id="adva"><small class="ok">Advantages of Constantinople</small><br>

 We are at present qualified to view the advantageous
 position of Constantinople, which appears to have been
 formed by nature for the centre and capital of a great
 monarchy. Situated in the forty-first degree of latitude,
 the Imperial city commanded, from her seven hills, <small>(<a href="nt17/022.htm">22</a>)</small> the 
 opposite shores of Europe and Asia; the climate was healthy
 and temperate, the soil fertile, the harbour secure and
 capacious, and the approach on the side of the continent was
 of small extent and easy defence. The Bosphorus and the
 Hellespont may be considered as the two gates of
 Constantinople, and the prince who possessed those important
 passages could always shut them against a naval enemy and
 open them to the fleets of commerce. The preservation of the
 eastern provinces may, in some degree, be ascribed to the
 policy of Constantine, as the barbarians of the Euxine, who
 in the preceding age had poured their armaments into the
 heart of the Mediterranean, soon desisted from the exercise
 of piracy, and despaired of forcing this insurmountable
 barrier. When the gates of the Hellespont and Bosphorus were
 shut, the capital still enjoyed within their spacious
 enclosure every production which could supply the wants or
 gratify the luxury of its numerous inhabitants. The
 seacoasts of Thrace and Bithynia, which languish under the
 weight of Turkish oppression, still exhibit a rich prospect
 of vineyards, of gardens, and of plentiful harvests; and the
 Propontis has ever been renowned for an inexhaustible store
 of the most exquisite fish, that are taken in their stated
 seasons, without skill, and almost without labour. <small>(<a href="nt17/023.htm">23</a>)</small> But 
 when the passages of the straits were thrown open for trade,
 they alternately admitted the natural and artificial riches
 of the north and south, of the Euxine and of the
 Mediterranean. Whatever rude commodities were collected in
 the forests of Germany and Scythia, as far as the sources of
 the Tanais and the Borysthenes; whatsoever was manufactured
 by the skill of Europe or Asia; the corn of Egypt, and the
 gems and spices of the farthest India, were brought by the
 varying winds into the port of Constantinople, which, for
 many ages, attracted the commerce of the ancient world. <small>(<a href="nt17/024.htm">24</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="foun"><small class="ok">Foundation of the city.</small><br>
 
 The prospect of beauty, of safety, and of wealth, united in
 a single spot, was sufficient to justify the choice of
 Constantine. But as some decent mixture of prodigy and fable
 has, in every age, been supposed to reflect a becoming
 majesty on the origin of great cities, <small>(<a href="nt17/025.htm">25</a>)</small> the emperor was 
 desirous of ascribing his resolution not so much to the
 uncertain counsels of human policy as to the infallible and
 eternal decrees of divine wisdom. In one of his laws he has
 been careful to instruct posterity that, in obedience to the
 commands of God, he laid the everlasting foundations of
 Constantinople; <small>(<a href="nt17/026.htm">26</a>)</small> and though he has not condescended to 
 relate in what manner the celestial inspiration was
 communicated to his mind, the defect of his modest silence
 has been liberally supplied by the ingenuity of succeeding
 writers, who describe the nocturnal vision which appeared to
 the fancy of Constantine as he slept within the walls of
 Byzantium. The tutelar genius of the city, a venerable
 matron sinking under the weight of years and infirmities,
 was suddenly transformed into a blooming maid, whom his own
 hands adorned with all the symbols of Imperial greatness. <small>(<a href="nt17/027.htm">27</a>)</small> 
 The monarch awoke, interpreted the auspicious omen, and
 obeyed, without hesitation, the will of Heaven. The day
 which gave birth to a city or colony was celebrated by the
 Romans with such ceremonies as had been ordained by a
 generous superstition; <small>(<a href="nt17/028.htm">28</a>)</small> and though Constantine might omit 
 some rites which savoured too strongly of their Pagan
 origin, yet he was anxious to leave a deep impression of
 hope and respect on the minds of the spectators. On foot,
 with a lance in his hand, the emperor himself led the solemn
 procession, and directed the line which was traced as the
 boundary of the destined capital, till the growing
 circumference was observed with astonishment by the
 assistants, who, at length ventured to observe that he had
 already exceeded the most ample measure of a great city.</p>
<blockquote> "I shall still advance," <em>replied Constantine, </em> "till HE, the invisible guide who marches before me, thinks proper to stop." <em><small>(<a href="nt17/029.htm">29</a>)</small></em></blockquote>

<p> Without presuming to investigate the nature or  motives of this extraordinary conductor, we shall content ourselves with the more humble task of describing the extent and limits of Constantinople. <small>(<a href="nt17/030.htm">30</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="exte"><small class="ok">Extent</small><br>
 
 In the actual state of the city, the palace and gardens of
 the Seraglio occupy the eastern promontory, the first of the
 seven hills, and cover about one hundred and fifty acres of
 our own measure. The seat of Turkish jealousy and despotism
 is erected on the foundations of a Grecian republic; but it
 may be supposed that the Byzantines were tempted by the
 conveniency of the harbour to extend their habitations on
 that side beyond the modern limits of the Seraglio. The new
 wall of Constantine stretched from the port to the Propontis
 across the enlarged breadth of the triangle, at the distance
 of fifteen stadia from the ancient fortification, and with
 the city of Byzantium they enclosed five of the seven hills
 which, to the eyes of those who approach Constantinople,
 appear to rise above each other in beautiful order. <small>(<a href="nt17/031.htm">31</a>)</small> About 
 a century after the death of the founder, the new buildings,
 extending on one side up the harbour, and on the other along
 the Propontis, already covered the narrow ridge of the sixth
 and the broad summit of the seventh hill. The necessity of
 protecting those suburbs from the incessant inroads of the
 barbarians engaged the younger Theodosius to surround his
 capital with an adequate and permanent enclosure of walls.
 <small>(<a href="nt17/032.htm">32</a>)</small> From the eastern promontory to the golden gate, the 
 extreme length of Constantinople was about three Roman
 miles, <small>(<a href="nt17/033.htm">33</a>)</small> the circumference measured between ten and eleven, 
 and the surface might be computed as equal to about two
 thousand English acres. It is impossible to justify the vain
 and credulous exaggerations of modern travellers, who have
 sometimes stretched the limits of Constantinople over the
 adjacent villages of the European and even of the Asiatic
 coast. <small>(<a href="nt17/034.htm">34</a>)</small> But the suburbs of Pera and Galata, though situate 
 beyond the harbour, may deserve to be considered as a part
 of the city; <small>(<a href="nt17/035.htm">35</a>)</small> and this addition may perhaps authorise the 
 measure of a Byzantine historian, who assigns sixteen Greek
 (about fourteen Roman) miles for the circumference of his
 native city. <small>(<a href="nt17/036.htm">36</a>)</small> Such an extent may seem not unworthy of an 
 Imperial residence. Yet Constantinople must yield to Babylon
 and Thebes, <small>(<a href="nt17/037.htm">37</a>)</small> to ancient Rome, to London, and even to 
 Paris. <small>(<a href="nt17/038.htm">38</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="prog"><small class="ok">Progress of the work.</small><br>
 
 The master of the Roman world, who aspired to erect an
 eternal monument of the glories of his reign, could employ
 in the prosecution of that great work the wealth, the
 labour, and all that yet remained of the genius, of obedient
 millions. Some estimate may be formed of the expense
 bestowed with Imperial liberality on the foundation of
 Constantinople by the allowance of about two millions five
 hundred thousand pounds for the construction of the walls,
 the porticoes, and the aqueducts. <small>(<a href="nt17/039.htm">39</a>)</small> The forests that 
 overshadowed the shores of the Euxine, and the celebrated
 quarries of white marble in the little island of
 Proconnesus, supplied an inexhaustible stock of materials,
 ready to be conveyed, by the convenience of a short
 water-carriage, to the harbour of Byzantium. <small>(<a href="nt17/040.htm">40</a>)</small> A multitude 
 of labourers and artificers urged the conclusion of the work
 with incessant toil; but the impatience of Constantine soon
 discovered that, in the decline of the arts, the skill as
 well as numbers of his architects bore a very unequal
 proportion to the greatness of his designs. The magistrates
 of the most distant provinces were therefore directed to
 institute schools, to appoint professors, and, by the hopes
 of rewards and privileges, to engage in the study and
 practice of architecture a sufficient number of ingenious
 youths who had received a liberal education. <small>(<a href="nt17/041.htm">41</a>)</small> The 
 buildings of the new city were executed by such artificers
 as the reign of Constantine could afford; but they were
 decorated by the hands of the most celebrated masters of the
 age of Pericles and Alexander. To revive the genius of
 Phidias and Lysippus surpassed indeed the power of a Roman
 emperor; but the immortal productions which they had
 bequeathed to posterity were exposed without defence to the
 rapacious vanity of a despot. By his commands the cities of
 Greece and Asia were despoiled of their most valuable
 ornaments. <small>(<a href="nt17/042.htm">42</a>)</small> The trophies of memorable wars, the objects of 
 religious veneration, the most finished statues of the gods
 and heroes, of the sages and poets of ancient times,
 contributed to the splendid triumph of Constantinople; and
 gave occasion to the remark of the historian Cedrenus, <small>(<a href="nt17/043.htm">43</a>)</small> 
 who observes, with some enthusiasm, that nothing seemed
 wanting except the souls of the illustrious men whom these
 admirable monuments were intended to represent. But it is
 not in the city of Constantine, nor in the declining period
 of an empire, when the human mind was depressed by civil and
 religious slavery, that we should seek for the souls of
 Homer and of Demosthenes.
 
</p><p id="edif"><small class="ok">Edifices</small><br>
 
 During the siege of Byzantium, the conqueror had pitched his
 tent on the commanding eminence of the second hill. To
 perpetuate the memory of his success, he chose the same
 advantageous position for the principal Forum, <small>(<a href="nt17/044.htm">44</a>)</small> which 
 appears to have been of a circular or rather elliptical
 form. The two opposite entrances formed triumphal arches;
 the porticoes, which enclosed it on every side, were filled
 with statues, and the centre of the Forum was occupied by a
 lofty column, of which a mutilated fragment is now degraded
 by the appellation of the burnt pillar. This column was
 erected on a pedestal of white marble twenty feet high, and
 was composed of ten pieces of porphyry, each of which
 measured about ten feet in height, and about thirty-three in
 circumference. <small>(<a href="nt17/045.htm">45</a>)</small> On the summit of the pillar, above one 
 hundred and twenty feet from the ground, stood the colossal
 statue of Apollo. It was of bronze, had been transported
 either from Athens or from a town of Phrygia, and was
 supposed to be the work of Phidias. The artist had represented the god of day, or, as it was afterwards interpreted, the emperor Constantine himself, with a sceptre in his right hand, the globe of the world in his left, and a crown of rays glittering on his head. <small>(<a href="nt17/046.htm">46</a>)</small> The Circus, or Hippodrome, was a stately building about four hundred paces in length, and one hundred in breadth. <small id="fragment">(<a href="nt17/047.htm">47</a>)</small> The space between the two <i>met&aelig;</i> or goals was filled with statues and obelisks; and we may still remark a very singular fragment of antiquity, the bodies of three serpents twisted into one pillar of brass. Their triple heads had once supported the golden tripod which, after the defeat of Xerxes, was consecrated in the temple of Delphi by the victorious Greeks. <small>(<a href="nt17/048.htm">48</a>)</small> The beauty of the Hippodrome has been long since  defaced by the rude hands of the Turkish conquerors, but, under the similar appellation of Atmeidan, it still serves as a place of exercise for their horses. From the throne, whence the emperor viewed the Circensian games a winding staircase <small>(<a href="nt17/049.htm">49</a>)</small> descended to the palace, a magnificent edifice, which scarcely yielded to the residence of Rome itself, and which, together with the dependent courts, gardens, and porticoes, covered a considerable extent of ground upon the banks of the Propontis, between the Hippodrome and the church of St. Sophia. <small>(<a href="nt17/050.htm">50</a>)</small> We might likewise celebrate the baths, which still retained the name of Zeuxippus, after they had been enriched by the munificence of Constantine, with lofty columns, various marbles, and above three-score statues of bronze. <small>(<a href="nt17/051.htm">51</a>)</small> But we should deviate from the design  of this history if we attempted minutely to describe the different buildings or quarters of the city. It may be sufficient to observe that whatever could adorn the dignity of a great capital, or contribute to the benefit or pleasure of its numerous inhabitants, was contained within the walls of Constantinople. A particular description composed about a century after its foundation, enumerates a capitol or school
 of learning, a circus, two theatres, eight public and one
 hundred and fifty-three private baths, fifty-two porticoes,
 five granaries, eight aqueducts or reservoirs of water, four
 spacious halls for the meetings of the senate or courts of
 justice, fourteen churches, fourteen palaces, and four
 thousand three hundred and eighty-eight houses which, for
 their size or beauty, deserved to be distinguished from the
 multitude of plebeian habitations. <small>(<a href="nt17/052.htm">52</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="popu"><small class="ok">Population</small><br>
 
 The populousness of his favoured city was the next and most
 serious object of the attention of its founder. In the dark
 ages which succeeded the translation of the empire, the
 remote and the immediate consequences of that memorable
 event were strangely confounded by the vanity of the Greeks
 and the credulity of the Latins.  <small>(<a href="nt17/053.htm">53</a>)</small> It was asserted and 
 believed that all the noble families of Rome, the senate,
 and the equestrian order, with their innumerable attendants,
 had followed their emperor to the banks of the Propontis;
 that a spurious race of strangers and plebeians was left to
 possess the solitude of the ancient capital; and that the
 lands of Italy, long since converted into gardens, were at
 once deprived of cultivation and inhabitants. <small>(<a href="nt17/054.htm">54</a>)</small> In the 
 course of this history such exaggerations will be reduced to
 their just value; yet since the growth of Constantinople
 cannot be ascribed to the general increase of mankind and of
 industry, it must be admitted that this artificial colony
 was raised at the expense of the ancient cities of the
 empire. Many opulent senators of Rome and of the eastern
 provinces were probably invited by Constantine to adopt for
 their country the fortunate spot which he had chosen for his
 own residence. The invitations of a master are scarcely to
 be distinguished from commands, and the liberality of the
 emperor obtained a ready and cheerful obedience. He bestowed
 on his favourites the palaces which he had built in the
 several quarters of the city, assigned them lands and
 pensions for the support of their dignity, <small>(<a href="nt17/055.htm">55</a>)</small> and alienated 
 the demesnes of Pontus and Asia to grant hereditary estates
 by the easy tenure of maintaining a house in the capital. <small>(<a href="nt17/056.htm">56</a>)</small> 
 But these encouragements and obligations soon became
 superfluous, and were gradually abolished. Wherever the seat
 of government is fixed, a considerable part of the public
 revenue will be expended by the prince himself, by his
 ministers, by the officers of justice, and by the domestics
 of the palace. The most wealthy of the provincials will be
 attracted by the powerful motives of interest and duty, of
 amusement and curiosity. A third and more numerous class of
 inhabitants will insensibly be formed, of servants, of
 artificers, and of merchants, who derive their subsistence
 from their own labour, and from the wants or luxury of the
 superior ranks. In less than a century Constantinople
 disputed with Rome itself the pre-eminence of riches and
 numbers. New piles of buildings, crowded together with too
 little regard to health or convenience, scarcely allowed the
 intervals of narrow streets for the perpetual throng of men,
 of horses, and of carriages. The allotted space of ground
 was insufficient to contain the increasing people, and the
 additional foundations, which on either side were advanced
 into the sea, might alone have composed a very considerable
 city. <small>(<a href="nt17/057.htm">57</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="priv"><small class="ok">Privileges</small><br>
 
 The frequent and regular distributions of wine and oil, of
 corn or bread, of money or provisions, had almost exempted
 the poorer citizens of Rome from the necessity of labour.
 The magnificence of the first Caesars was in some measure
 imitated by the founder of Constantinople: <small>(<a href="nt17/058.htm">58</a>)</small> but his 
 liberality, however it might excite the applause of the
 people, has incurred the censure of posterity. A nation of
 legislators and conquerors might assert their claim to the
 harvests of Africa, which had been purchased with their
 blood; and it was artfully contrived by Augustus, that, in
 the enjoyment of plenty, the Romans should lose the memory
 of freedom. But the prodigality of Constantine could not be
 excused by any consideration either of public or private
 interest; and the annual tribute of corn imposed upon Egypt
 for the benefit of his new capital was applied to feed a
 lazy and insolent populace, at the expense of the husbandmen
 of an industrious province. <small>(<a href="nt17/059.htm">59</a>)</small> Some other regulations of 
 this emperor are less liable to blame, but they are less
 deserving of notice. He divided Constantinople into fourteen
 regions or quarters, <small>(<a href="nt17/060.htm">60</a>)</small> dignified the public council with 
 the appellation of senate, <small>(<a href="nt17/061.htm">61</a>)</small> communicated to the citizens 
 the privileges of Italy, <small>(<a href="nt17/062.htm">62</a>)</small> and bestowed on the rising city 
 the title of Colony, the first and most favoured daughter of
 ancient Rome. The venerable parent still maintained the
 legal and acknowledged supremacy, which was due to her age,
 to her dignity, and to the remembrance of her former
 greatness. <small>(<a href="nt17/063.htm">63</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="dedi"><small class="ok">Dedication. A.D. 330 or 334.</small><br>
 
 As Constantine urged the progress of the work with the
 impatience of a lover, the walls, the porticoes, and the
 principal edifices were completed in a few years, or,
 according to another account, in a few months: <small>(<a href="nt17/064.htm">64</a>)</small> but this 
 extraordinary diligence should excite the less admiration,
 since many of the buildings were finished in so hasty and
 imperfect a manner, that, under the succeeding reign, they
 were preserved with difficulty from impending ruin. <small>(<a href="nt17/065.htm">65</a>)</small> But 
 while they displayed the vigour and freshness of youth, the
 founder prepared to celebrate the dedication of his city. <small>(<a href="nt17/066.htm">66</a>)</small> 
 The games and largesses which crowned the pomp of this
 memorable festival may easily be supposed; but there is one
 circumstance of a more singular and permanent nature, which
 ought not entirely to be overlooked. As often as the
 birthday of the city returned, the statue of Constantine,
 framed by his order, of gilt wood, and bearing in its right
 hand a small image of the genius of the place, was erected
 on a triumphal car. The guards, carrying white tapers, and
 clothed in their richest apparel, accompanied the solemn
 procession as it moved through the Hippodrome. When it was
 opposite to the throne of the reigning emperor, he rose from
 his seat, and with grateful reverence adored the memory of
 his predecessor. <small>(<a href="nt17/067.htm">67</a>)</small> At the festival of the dedication, an 
 edict, engraved on a column of marble, bestowed the title of
 SECOND or NEW ROME on the city of Constantine. <small>(<a href="nt17/068.htm">68</a>)</small> But the name of Constantinople <small>(<a href="nt17/069.htm">69</a>)</small> has prevailed over that honourable epithet, and after the revolution of fourteen centuries
 still perpetuates the fame of its author. <small>(<a href="nt17/070.htm">70</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="form"><small class="ok">Form of government.</small><br>
 
The foundation of a new capital is naturally connected with
 the establishment of a new form of civil and military
 administration. The distinct view of the complicated system
 of policy introduced by Diocletian, improved by Constantine,
 and completed by his immediate successors, may not only
 amuse the fancy by the singular picture of a great empire,
 but will tend to illustrate the secret and internal causes
 of its rapid decay. In the pursuit of any remarkable
 institution, we may be frequently led into the more early or
 the more recent times of the Roman history; but the proper
 limits of this inquiry will be included within a period of
 about one hundred and thirty years, from the accession of
 Constantine to the publication of the Theodosian code; <small>(<a href="nt17/071.htm">71</a>)</small> 
 from which, as well as from the <i>Notitia</i> of the East and
 West, <small>(<a href="nt17/072.htm">72</a>)</small> we derive the most copious and authentic 
 information of the state of the empire. This variety of
 objects will suspend, for some time, the course of the 
 narrative; but the interruption will be censured only by
 those readers who are insensible to the importance of laws
 and manners, while they peruse, with eager curiosity, the
 transient intrigues of a court, or the accidental event of a
 battle.
 
</p><p id="hier"><small class="ok">Hierachy of the state.</small><br>
 
 The manly pride of the Romans, content with substantial
 power, had left to the vanity of the East the forms and
 ceremonies of ostentatious greatness. <small>(<a href="nt17/073.htm">73</a>)</small> But when they lost 
 even the semblance of those virtues which were derived from
 their ancient freedom, the simplicity of Roman manners was
 insensibly corrupted by the stately affectation of the
 courts of Asia. The distinctions of personal merit and
 influence, so conspicuous in a republic, so feeble and
 obscure under a monarchy, were abolished by the despotism of
 the emperors; who substituted in their room a severe
 subordination of rank and office, from the titled slaves who
 were seated on the steps of the throne, to the meanest
 instruments of arbitrary power. This multitude of abject
 dependents was interested in the support of the actual
 government, from the dread of a revolution which might at
 once confound their hopes and intercept the reward of their
 services. In this divine hierarchy (for such it is
 frequently styled) every rank was marked with the most scrupulous exactness, and its dignity was displayed in a variety of trifling and solemn ceremonies, which it was a study to learn and a sacrilege to neglect. <small>(<a href="nt17/074.htm">74</a>)</small> The purity of  the Latin language was debased, by adopting, in the intercourse of pride and flattery, a profusion of epithets which Tully would scarcely have understood, and which Augustus would have rejected with indignation. The principal officers of the empire were saluted, even by the sovereign himself, with the deceitful titles of your <i>Sincerity</i>, your <i>Gravity</i>, your <i>Excellency</i>, your <i>Eminence</i>, your <i>sublime and wonderful Magnitude</i>, your <i>illustrious and magnificent Highness</i>. <small>(<a href="nt17/075.htm">75</a>)</small> The codicils or patents of their office were  curiously emblazoned with such emblems as were best adapted to explain its nature and high dignity &#8212; the image or portrait of the reigning emperors; a triumphal car; the book of mandates placed on a table, covered with a rich carpet, and illuminated by four tapers; the allegorical figures of the provinces which they governed; or the appellations and standards of the troops whom they commanded. Some of these official ensigns were really exhibited in their hall of audience; others preceded their pompous march whenever they appeared in public; and every circumstance of their demeanour, their dress, their ornaments, and their train, was calculated to inspire a deep reverence for the representatives of supreme majesty. By a philosophic observer the system of the Roman government might have been mistaken for a splendid theatre, filled with players of every character and degree, who repeated the language, and imitated the passions, of their original model. <small>(<a href="nt17/076.htm">76</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="thre"><small class="ok">Three ranks of honour.</small><br>
 
 All the magistrates of sufficient importance to find a place
 in the general state of the empire were accurately divided
 into three classes - 1, The <i>Illustrious</i>; 2, The
 <i>Spectabiles</i>, or <i>Respectable</i>; and, 3, The <i>Clarissimi</i>,
 whom we may translate by the word <i>Honourable</i>. In the times
 of Roman simplicity, the last-mentioned epithet was used
 only as a vague expression of deference, till it became at
 length the peculiar and appropriated title of all who were
 members of the senate, <small>(<a href="nt17/077.htm">77</a>)</small> and consequently of all who, from that venerable body, were selected to govern the provinces. The vanity of those who, from their rank and office, might
 claim a superior distinction above the rest of the
 senatorial order, was long afterwards indulged with the new
 appellation of <i>Respectable</i>: but the title of <i>Illustrious</i>
 was always reserved to some eminent personages who were
 obeyed or reverenced by the two subordinate classes. It was
 communicated only, <sup id="four"><i>Four divisions of office</i></sup>I. To the consuls and patricians; II. To
 the Praetorian praefects, with the praefects of Rome and
 Constantinople; III. To the masters general of the cavalry
 and the infantry; and,  IV. To the seven ministers of the
 palace, who exercised their 'sacred' functions about the
 person of the emperor. <small>(<a href="nt17/078.htm">78</a>)</small> Among those illustrious 
 magistrates who were esteemed coordinate with each other,
 the seniority of appointment gave place to the union of
 dignities. <small>(<a href="nt17/079.htm">79</a>)</small> By the expedient of honorary codicils, the 
 emperors, who were fond of multiplying their favours, might
 sometimes gratify the vanity, though not the ambition, of
 impatient courtiers. <small>(<a href="nt17/080.htm">80</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="theco"><small class="ok">The consuls</small><br>
 
 I. As long as the Roman consuls were the first magistrates
 of a free state, they derived their right to power from the
 choice of the people. As long as the: emperors condescended
 to disguise the servitude which they imposed, the consuls
 were still elected by the real or apparent suffrage of the
 senate. From the reign of Diocletian even these vestiges of
 liberty were abolished, and the successful candidates, who
 were invested with the annual honours of the consulship,
 affected to deplore the humiliating condition of their
 predecessors. The Scipios and the Catos had been reduced to
 solicit the votes of plebians, to pass through the tedious
 and expensive forms of a popular election, and to expose
 their dignity to the shame of a public refusal; while their
 own happier fate had reserved them for an age and government
 in which the rewards of virtue were assigned by the unerring
 wisdom of a gracious sovereign. <small>(<a href="nt17/081.htm">81</a>)</small> In the epistles which the 
 emperor addressed to the two consuls elect, it was declared
 that they were created by his sole authority. <small>(<a href="nt17/082.htm">82</a>)</small> Their names 
 and portraits, engraved on gilt tablets of ivory, were
 dispersed over the empire as presents to the provinces, the
 cities, the magistrates, the senate and the people. <small>(<a href="nt17/083.htm">83</a>)</small> Their 
 solemn inauguration was performed at the place of the
 Imperial residence; and during a period of one hundred and
 twenty years Rome was constantly deprived of the presence of
 her ancient magistrates. <small>(<a href="nt17/084.htm">84</a>)</small> On the morning of the first of 
 January the consuls assumed the ensigns of their dignity.
 Their dress was a robe of purple, embroidered in silk and
 gold, and sometimes ornamented with costly gems. <small>(<a href="nt17/085.htm">85</a>)</small> On this 
 solemn occasion they were attended by the most eminent
 officers of the state and army in the habit of senators; and
 the useless fasces, armed with the once formidable axes,
 were borne before them by the lictors. <small>(<a href="nt17/086.htm">86</a>)</small> The procession 
 moved from the palace <small>(<a href="nt17/087.htm">87</a>)</small> to the Forum or principal square of 
 the city; where the consuls ascended their tribunal, and
 seated themselves in the curule chairs, which were framed
 after the fashion of ancient times. They immediately
 exercised an act of jurisdiction, by the manumission of a
 slave who was brought before them for that purpose; and the
 ceremony was intended to represent the celebrated action of
 the elder Brutus, the author of liberty and of the
 consulship, when he admitted among his fellow-citizens the
 faithful Vindex, who had revealed the conspiracy of the
 Tarquins. <small>(<a href="nt17/088.htm">88</a>)</small> The public festival was continued during 
 several days in all the principal cities; in Rome, from
 custom; in Constantinople, from imitation; in Carthage,
 Antioch, and Alexandria, from the love of pleasure and the
 superfluity of wealth. <small>(<a href="nt17/089.htm">89</a>)</small> In the two capitals of the empire 
 the annual games of the theatre, the circus, and the
 amphitheatre <small>(<a href="nt17/090.htm">90</a>)</small> cost four thousand pounds of gold, (about) 
 one hundred and sixty thousand pounds sterling; and if so
 heavy an expense surpassed the faculties or the inclination
 of the magistrates themselves, the sum was supplied from the
 Imperial treasury. <small>(<a href="nt17/091.htm">91</a>)</small> As soon as the consuls had discharged 
 these customary duties, they were at liberty to retire into
 the shade of private life, and to enjoy during the remainder
 of the year the undisturbed contemplation of their own
 greatness. They no longer presided in the national councils;
 they no longer executed the resolutions of peace or war.
 Their abilities (unless they were employed in more effective
 offices) were of little moment; and their names served only
 as the legal date of the year in which they had filled the
 chair of Marius and of Cicero. Yet it was still felt and
 acknowledged, in the last period of Roman servitude, that
 this empty name might be compared, and even preferred, to
 the possession of substantial power. The title of consul was
 still the most splendid object of ambition, the noblest
 reward of virtue and loyalty. The emperors themselves who
 disdained the faint shadow of the republic, were conscious
 that they acquired an additional splendour and majesty as
 often as they assumed the annual honours of the consular
 dignity. <small>(<a href="nt17/092.htm">92</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="thepa"><small class="ok">The patricians</small><br>
 
The proudest and most perfect separation which can be found
 in any age or country between the nobles and the people is
 perhaps that of the Patricians and the Plebeians, as it was
 established in the first age of the Roman republic. Wealth
 and honours, the offices of the state, and the ceremonies of
 religion, were almost exclusively possessed by the former
 who, preserving the purity of their blood with the most
 insulting jealousy, <small>(<a href="nt17/093.htm">93</a>)</small> held their clients in a condition of 
 specious vassalage. But these distinctions, so incompatible
 with the spirit of a free people, were removed, after a long
 struggle, by the persevering efforts of the Tribunes. The
 most active and successful of the Plebeians accumulated
 wealth, aspired to honours, deserved triumphs, contracted
 alliances, and, after some generations, assumed the pride of
 ancient nobility. <small>(<a href="nt17/094.htm">94</a>)</small> The Patrician families, on the other 
 hand, whose original number was never recruited till the end
 of the commonwealth, either failed in the ordinary course of
 nature, or were extinguished in so many foreign and domestic
 wars, or, through a want of merit or fortune, insensibly
 mingled with the mass of the people. <small>(<a href="nt17/095.htm">95</a>)</small> Very few remained 
 who could derive their pure and genuine origin from the
 infancy of the city, or even from that of the republic, when
 Caesar and Augustus, Claudius and Vespasian, created from
 the body of the senate a competent number of new Patrician
 families, in the hope of perpetuating an order which was
 still considered as honourable and sacred. <small>(<a href="nt17/096.htm">96</a>)</small> But these 
 artificial supplies (in which the reigning house was always
 included) were rapidly swept away by the rage of tyrants, by
 frequent revolutions, by the change of manners, and by the
 intermixture of nations. <small>(<a href="nt17/097.htm">97</a>)</small> Little more was left when 
 Constantine ascended the throne than a vague and imperfect
 tradition that the Patricians had once been the first of the
 Romans. To form a body of nobles, whose influence may
 restrain while it secures the authority of the monarch,
 would have been very inconsistent with the character and
 policy of Constantine; but, had he seriously entertained
 such a design, it might have exceeded the measure of his
 power to ratify by an arbitrary edict an institution which
 must expect the sanction of time and of opinion. He revived,
 indeed, the title of PATRICIANS, but he revived it as a
 personal, not as an hereditary distinction. They yielded
 only to the transient superiority of the annual consuls; but
 they enjoyed the pre-eminence over all the great officers of
 state, with the most familiar access to the person of the
 prince. This honourable rank was bestowed on them for life;
 and, as they were usually favourites and ministers who had
 grown old in the Imperial court, the true etymology of the
 word was perverted by ignorance and flattery; and the
 Patricians of Constantine were reverenced as the adopted
 'Fathers' of the emperor and the republic. <small>(<a href="nt17/098.htm">98</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="thepra"><small class="ok">The praetorian praefects</small><br>
 
  II. The fortunes of the Praetorian prefects were
 essentially different from those of the consuls and
 Patricians. The latter saw their ancient greatness evaporate
 in a vain title. The former, rising by degrees from the most
 humble condition, were invested with the civil and military
 administration of the Roman world. From the reign of Severus
 to that of Diocletian, the guards and the palace, the laws
 and the finances, the armies and the provinces, were
 intrusted to their superintending care; and, like the vizirs
 of the East, they held with one hand the seal, and with the
 other the standard, of the empire. The ambition of the
 praefects, always formidable, and sometimes fatal to the
 masters whom they served, was supported by the strength of
 the Praetorian bands; but, after those haughty troops had
 been weakened by Diocletian and finally suppressed by
 Constantine, the praefects, who survived their fall, were
 reduced without difficulty to the station of useful and
 obedient ministers. When they were no longer responsible for
 the safety of the emperor's person, they resigned the
 jurisdiction which they had hitherto claimed and exercised
 over all the departments of the palace. They were deprived
 by Constantine of all military command as soon as they had
 ceased to lead into the field, under their immediate orders,
 the flower of the Roman troops; and, at length, by a
 singular revolution, the captains of the guards were
 transformed into the civil magistrates of the provinces.
 According to the plan of government instituted by
 Diocletian, the four princes had each their Praetorian
 praefect; and after the monarchy was once more united in the
 person of Constantine, he still continued to create the same
 number of FOUR PRAEFECTS, and intrusted to their care the
 same provinces which they already administered. 1. The
 praefect of the East stretched his ample jurisdiction into
 the three parts of the globe which were subject to the
 Romans, from the cataracts of the Nile to the banks of the
 Phasis, and from the mountains of Thrace to the frontiers of
 Persia. 2. The important provinces of Pannonia, Dacia,
 Macedonia, and Greece once acknowledged the authority of the
 praefect of Illyricum. 3. The power of the praefect of
 Italy was not confined to the country from whence he derived
 his title; it extended over the additional territory of
 Rhaetia as far as the banks of the Danube, over the
 dependent islands of the Mediterranean, and over that part
 of the continent of Africa which lies between the confines
 of Cyrene and those of Tingitania. 4. The praefect of the
 Gauls comprehended under that plural denomination the
 kindred provinces of Britain and Spain, and his authority
 was obeyed from the wall of Antoninus to the foot of Mount
 Atlas. <small>(<a href="nt17/099.htm">99</a>)</small></p> 
 
 <p>After the Praetorian praefects had been dismissed from all
 military command, the civil functions which they were
 ordained to exercise over so many subject nations were
 adequate to the ambition and abilities of the most
 consummate ministers. To their wisdom was committed the
 supreme administration of justice and of the finances, the
 two objects which, in a state of peace, comprehend almost
 all the respective duties of the sovereign and of the
 people; of the former, to protect the citizens who are
 obedient to the laws; of the latter, to contribute the share
 of their property which is required for the expenses of the
 state. The coin, the highways, the posts, the granaries, the
 manufactures, whatever could interest the public prosperity,
 was moderated by the authority of the Praetorian praefects.
 As the immediate representatives of the Imperial majesty,
 they were empowered to explain, to enforce, and on some
 occasions to modify, the general edicts by their
 discretionary proclamations. They watched over the conduct
 of the provincial governors, removed the negligent, and
 inflicted punishments on the guilty. From all the inferior
 jurisdictions an appeal in every matter of importance,
 either civil or criminal, might be brought before the
 tribunal of the praefect: but his sentence was final and
 absolute; and the emperors themselves refused to admit any
 complaints against the judgment or the integrity of a
 magistrate whom they honoured with such unbounded
 confidence. <small>(<a href="nt17/100.htm">100</a>)</small> His appointments were suitable to his 
 dignity; <small>(<a href="nt17/101.htm">101</a>)</small> and, if avarice was his ruling passion, he 
 enjoyed frequent opportunities of collecting a rich harvest
 of fees, of presents, and of perquisites. Though the
 emperors no longer dreaded the ambition of their praefects,
 they were attentive to counterbalance the power of this
 great office by the uncertainty and shortness of its
 duration. <small>(<a href="nt17/102.htm">102</a>)</small> 

</p><p id="prae"><small class="ok">The praefects of Rome and Constantinople.</small><br>

From their superior importance and dignity, 
 Rome and Constantinople were alone excepted from the
 jurisdiction of the Praetorian praefects. The immense size
 of the city, and the experience of the tardy, ineffectual
 operation of the laws, had furnished the policy of Augustus
 with a specious pretence for introducing a new magistrate,
 who alone could restrain a servile and turbulent populace by
 the strong arm of arbitrary power. <small>(<a href="nt17/103.htm">103</a>)</small> Valerius Messalla was 
 appointed the first praefect of Rome, that his reputation
 might countenance so invidious a measure; but at the end of
 a few days that accomplished citizen <small>(<a href="nt17/104.htm">104</a>)</small> resigned his 
 office, declaring, with a spirit worthy of the friend of
 Brutus, that he found himself incapable of exercising a
 power incompatible with public freedom. <small>(<a href="nt17/105.htm">105</a>)</small> As the sense of 
 liberty became less exquisite, the advantages of order were
 more clearly understood; and the praefect, who seemed to
 have been designed as a terror only to slaves and vagrants,
 was permitted to extend his civil and criminal jurisdiction
 over the equestrian and noble families of Rome. The
 praetors, annually created as the judges of law and equity,
 could not long dispute the possession of the Forum with a
 vigorous and permanent magistrate who was usually admitted
 into the confidence of the prince. Their courts were
 deserted; their number, which had once fluctuated between
 twelve and eighteen, <small>(<a href="nt17/106.htm">106</a>)</small> was gradually reduced to two or 
 three; and their important functions were confined to the
 expensive obligation <small>(<a href="nt17/107.htm">107</a>)</small> of exhibiting games for the 
 amusement of the people. After the office of Roman consuls
 had been changed into a vain pageant, which was rarely
 displayed in the capital, the praefects assumed their vacant
 place in the senate, and were soon acknowledged as the
 ordinary presidents of that venerable assembly. They
 received appeals from the distance of one hundred miles; and
 it was allowed as a principle of jurisprudence that all
 municipal authority was derived from them alone. <small>(<a href="nt17/108.htm">108</a>)</small> In the 
 discharge of his laborious employment the governor of Rome
 was assisted by fifteen officers, some of whom had been
 originally his equals, or even his superiors. The principal
 departments were relative to the command of a numerous
 watch, established as a safeguard against fires, robberies,
 and nocturnal disorders; the custody and distribution of the
 public allowance of corn and provisions; the care of the
 port, of the aqueducts, of the common sewers, and of the
 navigation and bed of the Tiber; the inspection of the
 markets, the theatres, and of the private as well as public
 works. Their vigilance ensured the three principal objects
 of a regular police - safety, plenty, and cleanliness; and,
 as a proof of the attention of government to preserve the
 splendour and ornaments of the capital, a particular
 inspector was appointed for the statues; the guardian, as it
 were, of that inanimate people, which, according to the
 extravagant computation of an old writer, was scarcely
 inferior in number to the living inhabitants of Rome. About
 thirty years after the foundation of Constantinople a
 similar magistrate was created in that rising metropolis,
 for the same uses and with the same powers. A perfect
 equality was established between the dignity of the <i>two</i>
 municipal and that of the <i>four</i> Praetorian praefects. <small>(<a href="nt17/109.htm">109</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="proco"><small class="ok">The proconsuls, vice-praefects, etc</small><br>

 Those who, in the Imperial hierarchy, were distinguished by
 the title of <i>Respectable</i> formed an intermediate class
 between the <i>illustrious</i> praefects and the <i>honourable</i>
 magistrates of the provinces. In this class the proconsuls
 of Asia, Achaia, and Africa claimed a pre-eminence, which
 was yielded to the remembrance of their ancient dignity; and
 the appeal from their tribunal to that of the praefects was
 almost the only mark of their dependence. <small>(<a href="nt17/110.htm">110</a>)</small> But the civil 
 government of the empire was distributed into thirteen great
 DIOCESES, each of which equalled the just measure of a
 powerful kingdom. The first of these dioceses was subject to
 the jurisdiction of the court of the East; and we may convey
 some idea of the importance and variety of his functions by
 observing that six hundred apparitors, who would be styled
 at present either secretaries, or clerks, or ushers, or
 messengers, were employed in his immediate office. <small>(<a href="nt17/111.htm">111</a>)</small> The 
 place of <i>Augustal praefect</i> of Egypt was no longer filled
 by a Roman knight, but the name was retained; and the
 extraordinary powers which the situation of the country and
 the temper of the inhabitants had once made indispensable
 were still continued to the governor. The eleven remaining
 dioceses - of Asiana, Pontica, and Thrace; of Macedonia,
 Dacia, and Pannonia, or Western Illyricum; of Italy and
 Africa; of Gaul, Spain, and Britain - were governed by
 twelve <i>vicars</i> or <i>vice-praefects</i>, <small>(<a href="nt17/112.htm">112</a>)</small> whose name sufficiently explains the nature and dependence of their
 office. It may be added that the lieutenant-generals of the
 Roman armies, the military counts and dukes, who will be
 hereafter mentioned, were allowed the rank and title of
 <i>Respectable</i>.
 
</p><p id="gove"><small class="ok">The governors of the provinces</small><br>
 
 As the spirit of jealousy and ostentation prevailed in the
 councils of the emperors, they proceeded with anxious
 diligence to divide the substance and to multiply the titles
 of power. The vast countries which the Roman conquerors had
 united under the same simple form of administration were
 imperceptibly crumbled into minute fragments, till at length
 the whole empire was distributed into one hundred and
 sixteen provinces, each of which supported an expensive and
 splendid establishment. Of these, three were governed by
 <i>proconsuls</i>, thirty-seven by <i>consulars</i>, five by
 <i>correctors</i>, and seventy-one by <i>presidents</i>. <small>(<a href="nt17/113.htm">113</a>)</small> The 
 appellations of these magistrates were different; they
 ranked in successive order, the ensigns of their dignity
 were curiously varied, and their situation, from accidental
 circumstances, might be more or less agreeable or
 advantageous. But they were all (excepting only the
 proconsuls) alike included in the class of <i>honourable</i>
 persons; and they were alike intrusted, during the pleasure
 of the prince, and under the authority of the praefects or
 their deputies, with the administration of justice and the
 finances in their respective districts. The ponderous
 volumes of the Codes and Pandects <small>(<a href="nt17/114.htm">114</a>)</small> would furnish ample 
 materials for a minute inquiry into the system of provincial
 government, as in the space of six centuries it was improved
 by the wisdom of the Roman statesmen and lawyers. It may be
 sufficient for the historian to select two singular and
 salutary provisions, intended to restrain the abuse of
 authority. <B ID="Governors" class="Big">1. For the preservation of peace and order, the governors of the provinces were armed with the sword of
 justice. They inflicted corporal punishments and they exercised, in capital offences, the power of life and death. But they were not authorized to indulge the condemned criminal with the choice of his own execution or to pronounce a sentence of the mildest and most honourable kind of exile. These prerogatives were reserved to the praefects, who alone could impose the heavy fine of fifty pounds of gold: their vicegerents were confined to the trifling weight of a few ounces. <small>(<a href="nt17/115.htm">115</a>)</small> This distinction, which seems to grant the larger while it denies the smaller degree ofauthority, was founded on a very rational motive. The smaller degree
 was infinitely more liable to abuse. The passions of a provincial magistrate might frequently provoke him into acts of oppression. which affected only the freedom or the fortunes of the subject; though, from a principle of prudence, perhaps of humanity, he might still be terrified by the guilt of innocent blood. It may likewise be considered that exile, considerable fines, or the choice of an easy death, relate more particularly to the rich and the
 noble; and the persons the most exposed to the avarice or resentment of a provincial magistrate were thus removed from his obscure persecution to the more august and impartial tribunal of the Praetorian praefect. <b class="Big">2. As it was reasonably apprehended that the integrity of the judge might be biased, if his interest was concerned or his affections were engaged, the strictest regulations were established to exclude any person, without the special dispensation of the emperor, from the government of the province where he was born, <small>(<a href="nt17/116.htm">116</a>)</small> and to prohibit the governor or his son from  contracting marriage with a native or an inhabitant, <small>(<a href="nt17/117.htm">117</a>)</small> or 
 from purchasing slaves, lands, or houses within the extent of his jurisdiction. <small>(<a href="nt17/118.htm">118</a>)</small> Notwithstanding these rigorous  precautions, the emperor Constantine, after a reign of
 twenty-five years still deplores the venal and oppressive administration of justice, and expresses the warmest indignation that the audience of the judge, his despatch of business, his seasonable delays, and his final sentence, were publicly sold, either by himself or by the officers of his court. The continuance, and perhaps the impunity, of these crimes is attested by the repetition of impotent laws and ineffectual menaces. <small>(<a href="nt17/119.htm">119</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="prof"><small class="ok">The profession of the law.</small><br>
 
 All the civil magistrates were drawn from the profession of
 the law. The celebrated Institutes of Justinian are
 addressed to the youth of his dominions who had devoted
 themselves to the study of Roman jurisprudence; and the
 sovereign condescends to animate their diligence by the
 assurance that their skill and ability would in time be
 rewarded by an adequate share in the government of the
 republic. <small>(<a href="nt17/120.htm">120</a>)</small> The rudiments of this lucrative science were 
 taught in all the considerable cities of the East and West;
 but the most famous school was that of Berytus, <small>(<a href="nt17/121.htm">121</a>)</small> on the 
 coast of Phoenicia, which flourished above three centuries
 from the time of Alexander Severus, the author perhaps of an
 Institution so advantageous to his native country. After a
 regular course of education, which lasted five years, the
 students dispersed themselves through the provinces in
 search of fortune and honours; nor could they want an
 inexhaustible supply of business in a great empire already
 corrupted by the multiplicity of laws, of arts, and of
 vices. The court of the Praetorian praefect of the East
 could alone furnish employment for one hundred and fifty
 advocates, sixty-four of whom were distinguished by peculiar
 privileges, and two were annually chosen with a salary of
 sixty pounds of gold to defend the causes of the treasury.
 The first experiment was made of their judicial talents by
 appointing them to act occasionally as assessors to the
 magistrates; from thence they were often raised to preside
 in the tribunals before which they had pleaded. They
 obtained the government of a province; and, by the aid of
 merit, of reputation, or of favour, they ascended, by
 successive steps, to the <i>illustrious</i> dignities of the
 state. <small>(<a href="nt17/122.htm">122</a>)</small> In the practice of the bar these men had 
 considered reason as the instrument of dispute; they
 interpreted the laws according to the dictates of private
 interest; and the same pernicious habits might still adhere
 to their characters in the public administration of the
 state. The honour of a liberal profession has indeed been
 vindicated by ancient and modern advocates, who have filled
 the most important stations with pure integrity and
 consummate wisdom; but in the decline of Roman jurisprudence
 the ordinary promotion of lawyers was pregnant with mischief
 and disgrace. The noble art, which had once been preserved
 as the sacred inheritance of the patricians, was fallen into
 the hands of freedmen and plebeians, <small>(<a href="nt17/123.htm">123</a>)</small> who, with cunning 
 rather than with skill, exercised a sordid and pernicious
 trade. Some of them procured admittance into families for
 the purpose of fomenting differences, of encouraging suits,
 and of preparing a harvest of gain for themselves or their
 brethren. Others, recluse in their chambers, maintained the
 gravity of legal professors, by furnishing a rich client
 with subtleties to confound the plainest truth, and with
 arguments to colour the most unjustifiable pretensions. The
 splendid and popular class was composed of the advocates,
 who filled the Forum with the sound of their turgid and
 loquacious rhetoric. Careless of fame and of justice, they
 are described for the most part as ignorant and rapacious
 guides, who conducted their clients through a maze of
 expense, of delay, and of disappointment from whence, after
 a tedious series of years, they were at length dismissed,
 when their patience and fortune were almost exhausted. <small>(<a href="nt17/124.htm">124</a>)</small> 
 
</p><p id="mili"><small class="ok">The military officers.</small><br>
 
 III.  In the system of policy introduced by Augustus, the
 governors, those at least of the Imperial provinces, were
 invested with the full powers of the sovereign himself.
 Ministers of peace and war, the distribution of rewards and
 punishments depended on them alone, and they successively
 appeared on their tribunal in the robes of civil magistracy,
 and in complete armour at the head of the Roman legions. <small>(<a href="nt17/125.htm">125</a>)</small> 
 The influence of the revenue, the authority of law, and the
 command of a military force, concurred to render their power
 supreme and absolute; and whenever they were tempted to
 violate their allegiance, the loyal province which they
 involved in their rebellion was scarcely sensible of any
 change in its political state. From the time of Commodus to
 the reign of Constantine near one hundred governors might be
 enumerated, who, with various success, erected the standard
 of revolt; and though the innocent were too often
 sacrificed, the guilty might be sometimes prevented, by the
 suspicious cruelty of their master. <small>(<a href="nt17/126.htm">126</a>)</small> To secure his throne 
 and the public tranquillity from these formidable servants,
 Constantine resolved to divide the military from the civil
 administration, and to establish, as a permanent and
 professional distinction, a practice which had been adopted
 only as an occasional expedient. The supreme jurisdiction
 exercised by the Praetorian praefects over the armies of the
 empire was transferred to the two masters general whom he
 instituted, the one for the cavalry, the other for the
 infantry; and though each of these illustrious officers was
 more peculiarly responsible for the discipline of those
 troops which were under his immediate inspection, they both
 indifferently commanded in the field the several bodies,
 whether of horse or foot, which were united in the same
 army. <small>(<a href="nt17/127.htm">127</a>)</small> Their number was soon doubled by the division of 
 the East and West; and as separate generals of the same rank
 and title were appointed on the four important frontiers of
 the Rhine, of the Upper and the Lower Danube, and of the
 Euphrates, the defence of the Roman empire was at length
 committed to eight masters general of the cavalry and
 infantry. Under their orders, thirty-five military
 commanders were stationed in the provinces: three in
 Britain, six in Gaul, one in Spain, one in Italy, five on
 the Upper and four on the Lower Danube, in Asia eight, three
 in Egypt, and four in Africa. The titles of <i>counts</i> and
 <i>dukes</i>,<small>(<a href="nt17/128.htm">128</a>)</small> by which they were properly distinguished, have obtained in modern languages so very different a sense that
 the use of them may occasion some surprise. But it should be
 recollected that the second of those appellations is only a
 corruption of the Latin word which was indiscriminately
 applied to any military chief. All these provincial generals
 were therefore dukes; but no more than ten among them were
 dignified with the rank of <i>counts</i> or <i>companions</i>, a title
 of honour, or rather of favour, which had been recently
 invented in the court of Constantine. A gold belt was the
 ensign which distinguished the office of the counts and
 dukes; and, besides their pay, they received a liberal
 allowance sufficient to maintain one hundred and ninety
 servants and one hundred and fifty-eight horses. They were
 strictly prohibited from interfering in any matter which
 related to the administration of justice or the revenue; but
 the command which they exercised over the troops of their
 department was independent of the authority of the
 magistrates. About the same time that Constantine gave a
 legal sanction to the ecclesiastical order, he instituted in
 the Roman empire the nice balance of the civil and the
 military powers. The emulation, and sometimes the discord,
 which reigned between two professions of opposite interests
 and incompatible manners, was productive of beneficial and
 of pernicious consequences. It was seldom to be expected
 that the general and the civil governor of a province should
 either conspire for the disturbance, or should unite for the
 service, of their country. While the one delayed to offer
 the assistance which the other disdained to solicit, the
 troops very frequently remained without orders or without
 supplies, the public safety was betrayed, and the
 defenceless subjects were left exposed to the fury of the
 barbarians. The divided administration, which had been
 formed by Constantine, relaxed the vigour of the state,
 while it secured the tranquillity of the monarch.
 
</p><p id="dist"><small class="ok">Distinction of the troops.</small><br>
 
 The memory of Constantine has been deservedly censured for
 another innovation which corrupted military discipline, and
 prepared the ruin of the empire. The nineteen years which
 preceded his final victory over Licinius had been a period
 of licence and intestine war. The rivals who contended for
 the possession of the Roman world had withdrawn the greatest
 part of their forces from the guard of the general frontier;
 and the principal cities which formed the boundary of their
 respective dominions were filled with soldiers, who
 considered their countrymen as their most implacable
 enemies. After the use of these internal garrisons had
 ceased with the civil war, the conqueror wanted either
 wisdom or firmness to revive the severe discipline of
 Diocletian, and to suppress a fatal indulgence which habit
 had endeared and almost confirmed to the military order.
 From the reign of Constantine a popular and even legal
 distinction was admitted between the <i>Palatines</i> <small>(<a href="nt17/129.htm">129</a>)</small> and the <i>Borderers</i>; the troops of the court, as they were
 improperly styled, and the troops of the frontier. The
 former, elevated by the superiority of their pay and
 privileges, were permitted, except in the extraordinary
 emergencies of war, to occupy their tranquil stations in the
 heart of the provinces. The most flourishing cities were
 oppressed by the intolerable weight of quarters. The soldiers insensibly forgot the virtues of their profession, and contracted only the vices of civil life.
 They were either degraded by the industry of mechanic
 trades, or enervated by the luxury of baths and theatres.
 They soon became careless of their martial exercises,
 curious in their diet and apparel, and, while they inspired
 terror to the subjects of the empire, they trembled at the
 hostile approach of the barbarians. <small>(<a href="nt17/130.htm">130</a>)</small> The chain of fortifications which Diocletian and his colleagues had extended along the banks of the great rivers
 was no longer maintained with the same care, or defended
 with the same vigilance. The numbers which still remained
 under the name of the troops of the frontier might be
 sufficient for the ordinary defence. But their spirit was
 degraded by the humiliating reflection that they, who were
 exposed to the hardships and dangers of a perpetual warfare,
 were rewarded only with about two-thirds of the pay and
 emoluments which were lavished on the troops of the court.
 Even the bands or legions that were raised the nearest to
 the level of those unworthy favourites were in some measure
 disgraced by the title of honour which they were allowed to
 assume. It was in vain that Constantine repeated the most
 dreadful menaces of fire and sword against the Borderers who
 should dare to desert their colours, to connive at the
 inroads of the barbarians, or to participate in the spoil. <small>(<a href="nt17/131.htm">131</a>)</small> 
 The mischiefs which flow from injudicious counsels are
 seldom removed by the application of partial severities; and
 though succeeding princes laboured to restore the strength
 and numbers of the frontier garrisons he empire, till the
 last moment of its dissolution, continued to languish under
 the mortal wound which had been so rashly or so weakly
 incited by the hand of Constantine.
 
</p><p id="redu"><small class="ok">Reduction of the legions</small><br>
 
 The same timid policy, of dividing whatever is united, of
 reducing whatever is eminent, of dreading every active
 power, and of expecting that the most feeble will prove the
 most obedient, seems to pervade the institutions of several
 princes, and particularly those of Constantine. The martial
 pride of the legions, whose victorious camps had so often
 been the scene of rebellion, was nourished by the memory of
 their past exploits, and the consciousness of their actual
 strength. As long as they maintained their ancient
 establishment of six thousand men, they subsisted, under the
 reign of Diocletian, each of them singly, a visible and
 important object in the military history of the Roman
 empire. A few years afterwards these gigantic bodies were
 shrunk to a very diminutive size; and when seven legions,
 with some auxiliaries, defended the city of Amida against
 the Persians, the total garrison, with the inhabitants of
 both sexes, and the peasants of the deserted country, did
 not exceed the number of twenty thousand persons. <small>(<a href="nt17/132.htm">132</a>)</small> From this fact, and from similar examples, there is reason to
 believe that the constitution of the legionary troops, to
 which they partly owed their valour and discipline, was
 dissolved by Constantine; and that the bands of Roman
 infantry, which still assumed the same names and the same
 honours, consisted only of one thousand or fifteen hundred
 men. <small>(<a href="nt17/133.htm">133</a>)</small> The conspiracy of so many separate detachments, 
 each of which was awed by the sense of its own weakness,
 could easily be checked; and the successors of Constantine
 might indulge their love of ostentation, by issuing their
 orders to one hundred and thirty-two legions, inscribed on
 the muster-roll of their numerous armies. The remainder of
 their troops was distributed into several hundred cohorts of
 infantry, and squadrons of cavalry. Their arms, and titles,
 and ensigns were calculated to inspire terror, and to
 display the variety of nations who marched under the
 Imperial standard. And not a vestige was left of that severe
 simplicity which, in the ages of freedom and victory, had
 distinguished the line of battle of a Roman army from the
 confused host of an Asiatic monarch. <small>(<a href="nt17/134.htm">134</a>)</small> A more particular 
 enumeration, drawn from the Notitia, might exercise the
 diligence of an antiquary; but the historian will content
 himself with observing that the number of permanent stations
 or garrisons established on the frontiers of the empire
 amounted to five hundred and eighty-three; and that, under
 the successors of Constantine, the complete force of
 military establishment was computed at six hundred and
 forty-five thousand soldiers. <small>(<a href="nt17/135.htm">135</a>)</small> An effort so prodigious 
 surpassed the wants of a more ancient and the faculties of a
 later period.

</p><p id="diff"><small class="ok">Difficulty of levies.</small><br>
 
 In the various states of society, armies are recruited from
 very different motives. Barbarians are urged by their love
 of war; the citizens of a free republic may be prompted by a
 principle of duty; the subjects, or at least the nobles, of
 a monarchy are animated by a sentiment of honour; but the
 timid and luxurious inhabitants of a declining empire must
 be allured into the service by the hopes of profit, or
 compelled by the dread of punishment. The resources of the
 Roman treasury were exhausted by the increase of pay, by the
 repetition of donatives, and by the invention of new
 emoluments and indulgences, which, in the opinion of the
 provincial youth, might compensate the hardships and dangers
 of a military life. Yet, although the stature was lowered,
  <small>(<a href="nt17/136.htm">136</a>)</small> although slaves, at least by a tacit connivance, were 
 indiscriminately received into the ranks, the insurmountable
 difficulty of procuring a regular and adequate supply of
 volunteers obliged the emperors to adopt more effectual and
 coercive methods. The lands bestowed on the veterans, as the
 free reward of their valour, were henceforward granted under
 a condition which contains the first rudiments of the feudal
 tenures - that their sons, who succeeded to the inheritance,
 should devote themselves to the profession of arms as soon
 as they attained the age of manhood; and their cowardly
 refusal was punished by the loss of honour, of fortune, or
 even of life. <small>(<a href="nt17/137.htm">137</a>)</small> But as the annual growth of the sons of 
 the veterans bore a very small proportion to the demands of
 the service, levies of men were frequently required from the
 provinces, and every proprietor was obliged either to take
 up arms, or to procure a substitute, or to purchase his
 exemption by the payment of a heavy fine. The sum of
 forty-two pieces of gold, to which it was reduced,
 ascertains the exorbitant price of volunteers, and the
 reluctance with which the government admitted of this
 alternative. <small>(<a href="nt17/138.htm">138</a>)</small> Such was the horror for the profession of a 
 soldier which had affected the minds of the degenerate
 Romans that many of the youth of Italy and the provinces
 chose to cut off the fingers of their right hand to escape
 from being pressed into the service; and this strange
 expedient was so commonly practised as to deserve the severe
 animadversion of the laws, <small>(<a href="nt17/139.htm">139</a>)</small> and a peculiar name in the 
 Latin language. <small>(<a href="nt17/140.htm">140</a>)</small> 

</p><p id="incr"><small class="ok">Increase of Barbarian auxillaries</small><br>

The introduction of barbarians into the 
 Roman armies became every day more universal, more
 necessary, and more fatal. The most daring of the Scythians,
 of the Goths, and of the Germans, who delighted in war, and
 who found it more profitable to defend than to ravage the
 provinces, were enrolled not only in the auxiliaries of
 their respective nations, but in the legions themselves, and
 among the most distinguished of the Palatine troops. As they
 freely mingled with the subjects of the empire, they
 gradually learned to despise their manners and imitate their
 arts. They abjured the implicit reverence which the pride of
 Rome had exacted from their ignorance, while they acquired
 the knowledge and possession of those advantages by which
 alone she supported her declining greatness. The barbarian
 soldiers who displayed any military talents were advanced,
 without exception, to the most important commands; and the
 names of the tribunes, of the counts and dukes, and of the
 generals themselves, betray a foreign origin, which they no
 longer condescended to disguise. They were often intrusted
 with the conduct of a war against their countrymen; and
 though most of them preferred the ties of allegiance to
 those of blood, they did not always avoid the guilt, or at
 least the suspicion, of holding a treasonable correspondence
 with the enemy, of inviting his invasion, or of sparing his
 retreat. The camps and the palace of the son of Constantine
 were governed by the powerful faction of the Franks, who
 preserved the strictest connection with each other and with
 their country, and who resented every personal affront as a
 national indignity. <small>(<a href="nt17/141.htm">141</a>)</small> When the tyrant Caligula was 
 suspected of an intention to invest a very extraordinary
 candidate with the consular robes, the sacrilegious
 profanation would have scarcely excited less astonishment
 if, instead of a horse, the noblest chieftain of Germany or
 Britain had been the object of his choice. The revolution of
 three centuries had produced so remarkable a change in the
 prejudices of the people, that, with the public approbation,
 Constantine showed his successors the example of bestowing
 the honours of the consulship on the barbarians who, by
 their merit and services, had deserved to be ranked among
 the first of the Romans. <small>(<a href="nt17/142.htm">142</a>)</small> But as these hardy veterans, 
 who had been educated in the ignorance or contempt of the
 laws were incapable of exercising any civil offices, the
 powers of the human mind were contracted by the
 irreconcilable separation of talents as well as of
 professions. The accomplished citizens of the Greek and
 Roman republics, whose characters could adapt themselves to
 the bar, the senate, to the camp, or the schools, had
 learned to write, to speak, and to act with the same spirit,
 and with equal abilities.

</p><p id="seve"><small class="ok">Seven ministers of the palace.</small><br>
 
  IV. Besides the magistrates and generals, who at a distance
 from the court diffused their delegated authority over the
 provinces and armies, the emperor conferred the rank of
 <i>Illustrious</i> on seven of his more immediate servants, to
 whose fidelity he intrusted his safety, or his counsels, or
 his treasures. <sup id="cham"><i>The chamberlain</i></sup> 1. The private apartments of the palace were
 governed by a favourite eunuch, who, in the language of that
 age, was styled the <i>praepositus</i> or praefect of the sacred
 bed-chamber. His duty was to attend the emperor in his hours
 of state or in those of amusement, and to perform about his
 person all those menial services which can only derive their
 splendour from the influence of royalty. Under a prince who
 deserved to reign, the great chamberlain (for such we may
 call him) was an useful and humble domestic; but an artful
 domestic, who improves every occasion of unguarded
 confidence, will insensibly acquire over a feeble mind that
 ascendant which harsh wisdom and uncomplying virtue can
 seldom obtain. The degenerate grandsons of Theodosius, who
 were invisible to their subjects, and contemptible to their
 enemies, exalted the praefects of their bed-chamber above
 the heads of all the ministers of the palace; <small>(<a href="nt17/143.htm">143</a>)</small> and even 
 his deputy, the first of the splendid train of slaves who
 waited in the presence, was thought worthy to rank before the <i>respectable</i> proconsuls of Greece or Asia. The jurisdiction of the chamberlain was acknowledged by the <i>counts</i>, or superintendents, who regulated the two important provinces of the magnificence of the wardrobe, and of the luxury of the Imperial table. <small>(<a href="nt17/144.htm">144</a>)</small> <sup id="mast"><i>The master of the offices.</i></sup>2. The principal administration of public affairs was committed to the diligence and abilities of the <i>master of the 0ffices</i>. <small>(<a href="nt17/145.htm">145</a>)</small> He was the supreme magistrate of the palace, inspected the discipline of the civil and military schools, and received appeals from all parts of the empire, in the causes which related to that numerous army of privileged persons who, as the servants of the court, had obtained for themselves and families a right to decline the authority of the ordinary judges. The correspondence between the prince and his subjects was managed by the four <i>scrinia</i>, or offices of
 this minister of state. The first was appropriated to memorials, the second to epistles, the third to petitions, and the fourth to papers and orders of a miscellaneous kind. Each of these was directed by an inferior <i>master of  respectable</i> dignity, and the whole business was despatched by an hundred and forty-eight secretaries, chosen for the most part from the profession of the law, on account of the variety of abstracts of reports and references which frequently occurred in the exercise of their several functions. From a condescension which in former ages would have been deemed unworthy of the Roman majesty, a particular secretary was allowed for the Greek language; and
 interpreters were appointed to receive the ambassadors of the barbarians; but the department of foreign affairs, which constitutes so essential a part of modern policy, seldom diverted the attention of the master of the offices. His mind was more seriously engaged by the general direction of the posts and arsenals of the empire. There were thirty-four cities, fifteen in the East and nineteen in the West, in which regular companies of workmen were perpetually employed in fabricating defensive armour, offensive weapons of all sorts, and military engines, which were deposited in the arsenals, and occasionally delivered for the service of the troops. <sup id="quae"><i>The quaestor</i></sup>3. In the course of nine centuries the office of <i>quaestor</i> had experienced a very singular revolution. In the infancy of Rome, two inferior magistrates were annually elected by the people, to relieve the consuls from the invidious management of the public treasure; <small>(<a href="nt17/146.htm">146</a>)</small> a similar assistant was granted to every proconsul and to every praetor who exercised a military or provincial command; with the extent of conquest, the two quaestors were gradually multiplied to the number of four, of eight, of twenty, and
 for a short time, perhaps, of forty; <small>(<a href="nt17/147.htm">147</a>)</small> and the noblest citizens ambitiously solicited an office which gave them a seat in the senate, and a just hope of obtaining the honours of the republic. Whilst Augustus affected to maintain the freedom of election, he consented to accept the annual privilege of recommending, or rather indeed of nominating, a certain proportion of candidates; and it was his custom to select one of these distinguished youths to read his orations or epistles in the assemblies of the senate. <small>(<a href="nt17/148.htm">148</a>)</small>  The practice of Augustus was imitated by succeeding princes; the occasional commission was established as a permanent office; and the favoured quaestor, assuming a new and more illustrious character, alone survived the suppression of his ancient and useless colleagues. <small>(<a href="nt17/149.htm">149</a>)</small> As the orations which he composed in the name of the emperor <small>(<a href="nt17/150.htm">150</a>)</small> acquired the force, and at length the form, of absolute edicts, he was considered as the representative of the legislative power, the oracle of the council, and the original source of the civil jurisprudence. He was sometimes invited to take his seat in the supreme judicature of the Imperial consistory, with the Praetorian praefects and the master of the offices; and he was frequently requested to resolve the doubts of inferior judges: but as he was not oppressed with a variety of subordinate business, his leisure and talents were employed to cultivate that dignified style of eloquence which, in the corruption of taste and language, still preserves the majesty of the Roman laws. <small>(<a href="nt17/151.htm">151</a>)</small> In some respects the office of the Imperial quaestor may be compared with that of a modern chancellor; but the use of a great seal, which seems to have been adopted by the illiterate barbarians, was never introduced to attest the public acts of the emperors. <sup id="publ"><i>The public treasurer</i></sup>4. The extraordinary title of <i>count of the sacred largesses</i> was bestowed on the treasurer-general of the revenue, with the intention perhaps of inculcating that every payment flowed from the voluntary bounty of the
 monarch. To conceive the almost infinite detail of the annual and daily expense of the civil and military administration in every part of a great empire would exceed the powers of the most vigorous imagination. The actual
 account employed several hundred persons, distributed into eleven different offices, which were artfully contrived to examine and control their respective operations. The multitude of these agents had a natural tendency to increase; and it was more than once thought expedient to dismiss to their native homes the useless supernumeraries, who, deserting their honest labours, had pressed with too
 much eagerness into the lucrative profession of the
 finances. <small>(<a href="nt17/152.htm">152</a>)</small> Twenty-nine provincial receivers, of whom 
 eighteen were honoured with the title of count, corresponded
 with the treasurer, and he extended his jurisdiction over
 the mines from whence the precious metals were extracted,
 over the mints in which they were converted into the current
 coin, and over the public treasuries of the most important
 cities, where they were deposited for the service of the
 state. The foreign trade of the empire was regulated by this
 minister, who directed likewise all the linen and woollen
 manufactures, in which the successive operations of
 spinning, weaving, and dyeing were executed, chiefly by
 women of a servile condition, for the use of the palace and
 army. Twenty-six of these institutions are enumerated in the
 West, where the arts had been more recently introduced, and
 a still larger proportion may be allowed for the industrious
 provinces of the East. <small>(<a href="nt17/153.htm">153</a>)</small><sup id="priva"><i>The private treasurer</i></sup>5. Besides the public revenue, which an absolute monarch might levy and expend according to
 his pleasure, the emperors, in the capacity of opulent
 citizens, possessed a very extensive property, which was
 administered by the <i>count</i> or treasurer of the <i>private
 estate</i>. Some part had perhaps been the ancient demesnes of
 kings and republics; some accessions might be derived from
 the families which were successively invested with the
 purple; but the most considerable portion flowed from the
 impure source of confiscations and forfeitures. The Imperial
 estates were scattered through the provinces from Mauritania
 to Britain; but the rich and fertile soil of Cappadocia
 tempted the monarch to acquire in that country his fairest
 possessions, <small>(<a href="nt17/154.htm">154</a>)</small> and either Constantine or his successors 
 embraced the occasion of justifying avarice by religious
 zeal. They suppressed the rich temple of Comana, where the
 high-priest of the goddess of war supported the dignity of a
 sovereign prince; and they applied to their private use the
 consecrated lands, which were inhabited by six thousand
 subjects or slaves of the deity and her ministers. <small>(<a href="nt17/155.htm">155</a>)</small> But 
 these were not the valuable inhabitants: the plains that
 stretch from the foot of Mount Argaeus to the banks of the
 Sarus bred a generous race of horses, renowned above all
 others in the ancient world for their majestic shape and
 incomparable swiftness. These sacred animals, destined for
 the service of the palace and the Imperial games, were
 protected by the laws from the profanation of a vulgar
 master. <small>(<a href="nt17/156.htm">156</a>)</small> The demesnes of Cappadocia were important enough 
 to require the inspection of a count, <small>(<a href="nt17/157.htm">157</a>)</small> officers of an inferior rank were stationed in the other parts of the empire; and the deputies of the private, as well as those of the public treasurer, were maintained in the exercise of
 their independent functions, and encouraged to control the authority of the provincial magistrates. <small>(<a href="nt17/158.htm">158</a>)</small> <sup id="coun"><i>The counts of the domestics.</i></sup>6, 7. The chosen bands of cavalry and infantry, which guarded the person of the emperor, were under the immediate command of the <i>two counts of the domestics</i>. The whole number consisted of three thousand and five hundred men, divided into seven schools, or troops, of five hundred each; and in the East this honourable service was almost entirely appropriated to the Armenians. Whenever, on public ceremonies, they were drawn up in the courts and porticos of the palace, their lofty stature, silent order, and splendid arms of silver and gold, displayed a martial pomp not unworthy of the Roman majesty. <small>(<a href="nt17/159.htm">159</a>)</small> From the seven schools 
 two companies of horse and foot were selected, of the protectors, whose advantageous station was the hope and reward of the most deserving soldiers. They mounted guard in the interior apartments, and were occasionally despatched into the provinces, to execute with celerity and vigour the
 orders of their master. <small>(<a href="nt17/160.htm">160</a>)</small> The counts of the domestics had succeeded to the office of the Praetorian praefects; like the praefects, they aspired from the service of the palace to the command of armies.

</p><p id="agen"><small class="ok">Agents, or official spies.</small><br>
 
 The perpetual intercourse between the court and the provinces was facilitated by the construction of roads and the institution of posts. But these beneficial establishments were accidentally connected with a pernicious
 and intolerable abuse. Two or three hundred agents or messengers were employed, under the jurisdiction of the master of the offices, to announce the names of the annual consuls, and the edicts or victories of the emperors. They
 insensibly assumed the licence of reporting whatever they
 could observe of the conduct either of magistrates or of
 private citizens; and were soon considered as the eyes of
 the monarch <small>(<a href="nt17/161.htm">161</a>)</small> and the scourge of the people. Under the 
 warm influence of a feeble reign they multiplied to the
 incredible number of ten thousand, disdained the mild though
 frequent admonitions of the laws, and exercised in the
 profitable management of the posts a rapacious and insolent
 oppression. These official spies, who regularly corresponded
 with the palace, were encouraged, by favour and reward,
 anxiously to watch the progress of every treasonable design,
 from the faint and latent symptoms of disaffection, to the
 actual preparation of an open revolt. Their careless or
 criminal violation of truth and justice was covered by the
 consecrated mask of zeal and they might securely aim their
 poisoned arrows at the breast either of the guilty or the
 innocent, who had provoked their resentment, or refused to
 purchase their silence. A faithful subject, of Syria
 perhaps, or of Britain, was exposed to the danger, or at
 least to the dread, of being dragged in chains to the court
 of Milan or Constantinople, to defend his life and fortune
 against the malicious charge of these privileged informers.
 The ordinary administration was conducted by those methods
 which extreme necessity can alone palliate; and the defects
 of evidence were diligently supplied by the use of torture.
  <small>(<a href="nt17/162.htm">162</a>)</small> 

</p><p id="useo"><small class="ok">Use of torture</small><br>

 The deceitful and dangerous experiment of the criminal
 <i>question</i>, as it is emphatically styled, was admitted,
 rather than approved, in the jurisprudence of the Romans.
 They applied this sanguinary mode of examination only to
 servile bodies, whose sufferings were seldom weighed by
 those haughty republicans in the scale of justice or
 humanity; but they would never consent to violate the sacred
 person of a citizen till they possessed the clearest
 evidence of his guilt. <small>(<a href="nt17/163.htm">163</a>)</small> The annals of tyranny, from the 
 reign of Tiberius to that of Domitian, circumstantially
 relate the executions of many innocent victims; but, as long
 as the faintest remembrance was kept alive of the national
 freedom and honour, the last hours of a Roman were secure
 from the danger of ignominious torture. <small>(<a href="nt17/164.htm">164</a>)</small> The conduct of 
 the provincial magistrates was not, however, regulated by
 the practice of the city, or the strict maxims of the
 civilians. They found the use of torture established not
 only among the slaves of oriental despotism, but among the
 Macedonians, who obeyed a limited monarch; among the
 Rhodians, who flourished by the liberty of commerce; and
 even among the sage Athenians, who had asserted and adorned
 the dignity of human kind. <small>(<a href="nt17/165.htm">165</a>)</small> The acquiescence of the 
 provincials encouraged their governors to acquire, or
 perhaps to usurp, a discretionary power of employing the
 rack, to extort from vagrants or plebeian criminals the
 confession of their guilt, till they insensibly proceeded to
 confound the distinctions of rank, and to disregard the
 privileges of Roman citizens. The apprehensions of the
 subjects urged them to solicit, and the interest of the
 sovereign engaged him to grant, a variety of special
 exemptions, which tacitly allowed, and even authorised, the
 general use of torture. They protected all persons of
 <i>illustrious</i> or <i>honourable</i> rank bishops and their
 presbyters, professors of the liberal arts, soldiers and
 their families, municipal officers, and their posterity to
 the third generation, and all children under the age of
 puberty. <small>(<a href="nt17/166.htm">166</a>)</small> But a fatal maxim was introduced into the new 
 jurisprudence of the empire, that in the case of treason,
 which included every offence that the subtlety of lawyers
 could derive from an hostile intention towards the prince or
 republic, <small>(<a href="nt17/167.htm">167</a>)</small> all privileges were suspended, and all 
 conditions were reduced to the same ignominious level. As
 the safety of the emperor was avowedly preferred to every
 consideration of justice or humanity, the dignity of age and
 the tenderness of youth were alike exposed to the most cruel
 tortures; and the terrors of a malicious information, which
 might select them as the accomplices, or even as the
 witnesses, perhaps, of an imaginary crime, perpetually hung
 over the heads of the principal citizens of the Roman world.
  <small>(<a href="nt17/168.htm">168</a>)</small> 

</p><p id="fina"><small class="ok">Finances</small><br>
 
 These evils, however terrible they may appear, were confined
 to the smaller number of Roman subjects whose dangerous
 situation was in some degree compensated by the enjoyment of
 those advantages, either of nature or of fortune, which
 exposed them to the jealousy of the monarch. The obscure
 millions of a great empire have much less to dread from the
 cruelty than from the avarice of their masters; and their
 humble happiness is principally affected by the grievance of
 excessive taxes, which, gently pressing on the wealthy,
 descend with accelerated weight on the meaner and more
 indigent classes of society. An ingenious philosopher <small>(<a href="nt17/169.htm">169</a>)</small> 
 has calculated the universal measure of the public
 impositions by the degrees of freedom and servitude; and
 ventures to assert that, according to an invariable law of
 nature, it must always increase with the former, and
 diminish in a just proportion to the latter. But this
 reflection, which would tend to alleviate the miseries of
 despotism, is contradicted at least by the history of the
 Roman empire; which accuses the same princes of despoiling
 the senate of its authority, and the provinces of their
 wealth. Without abolishing all the various customs and
 duties on merchandises, which are imperceptibly discharged
 by the apparent choice of the purchaser, the policy of
 Constantine and his successors preferred a simple and direct
 mode of taxation, more congenial to the spirit of an
 arbitrary government. <small>(<a href="nt17/170.htm">170</a>)</small> 

</p><p id="gene"><small class="ok">The general tribute, or indiction. </small><br>
 
 The name and use of the <i>indictions</i>, <small>(<a href="nt17/171.htm">171</a>)</small> which serve to ascertain the chronology of the middle ages, was derived
 from the regular practice of the Roman tributes. <small>(<a href="nt17/172.htm">172</a>)</small> The 
 emperor subscribed with his own hand, and in purple ink, the
 solemn edict, or <i>indiction</i>, which was fixed up in the
 principal city of each diocese during two months previous to
 the first day of September. And, by a very easy connection
 of ideas, the word indiction was transferred to the measure
 of tribute which it prescribed, and to the annual term which
 it allowed for the payment. This general estimate of the
 supplies was proportioned to the real and imaginary wants of
 the state; but as often as the expense exceeded the revenue,
 or the revenue fell short of the computation, an additional
 tax, under the name of <i>superindiction</i>, was imposed on the
 people, and the most valuable attribute of sovereignty was
 communicated to the Praetorian praefects, who, on some
 occasions, were permitted to provide for the unforeseen and
 extraordinary exigencies of the public service. The
 execution of these laws (which it would be tedious to pursue
 in their minute and intricate detail) consisted of two
 distinct operations: the resolving the general imposition
 into its constituent parts, which were assessed on the
 provinces, the cities, and the individuals of the Roman
 world; and the collecting the separate contributions of the
 individuals, the cities, and the provinces, till the
 accumulated sums were poured into the Imperial treasuries.
 But as the account between the monarch and the subject was
 perpetually open, and as the renewal of the demand
 anticipated the perfect discharge of the preceding
 obligation, the weighty machine of the finances was moved by
 the same hands round the circle of its yearly revolution.
 Whatever was honourable or important in the administration
 of the revenue was committed to the wisdom of the praefects
 and their provincial representatives; the lucrative
 functions were claimed by a crowd of subordinate officers,
 some of whom depended on the treasurer, others on the
 governor of the province; and who, in the inevitable
 conflicts of a perplexed jurisdiction, had frequent
 opportunities of disputing with each other the spoils of the
 people. The laborious offices, which could be productive
 only of envy and reproach, of expense and danger, were
 imposed on the <i>Decurions</i>, who formed the corporations of
 the cities, and whom the severity of the Imperial laws had
 condemned to sustain the burdens of civil society. <small>(<a href="nt17/173.htm">173</a>)</small> The 
 whole landed property of the empire (without excepting the
 patrimonial estates of the monarch) was the object of
 ordinary taxation; and every new purchaser contracted the
 obligations of the former proprietor. An accurate census,
  <small>(<a href="nt17/174.htm">174</a>)</small> or survey, was the only equitable mode of ascertaining 
 the proportion which every citizen should be obliged to
 contribute for the public service; and from the well-known
 period of the indictions, there is reason to believe that
 this difficult and expensive operation was repeated at the
 regular distance of fifteen years. The lands were measured
 by surveyors, who were sent into the provinces; their
 nature, whether arable or pasture, or vineyards or woods,
 was distinctly reported; and an estimate was made of their
 common value from the average produce of five years. The
 numbers of slaves and cattle constituted an essential part
 of the report; an oath was administered to the proprietors
 which bound them to disclose the true state of the affairs;
 and their attempts to prevaricate, or elude the intention of
 the legislator, were severely watched, and punished as a
 capital crime, which included the double guilt of treason
 and sacrilege. <small>(<a href="nt17/175.htm">175</a>)</small> A large portion of the tribute was paid 
 in money; and of the current coin of the empire, gold alone
 could be legally accepted. <small>(<a href="nt17/176.htm">176</a>)</small> The remainder of the taxes, 
 according to the proportions determined by the annual
 indiction, was furnished in a manner still more direct, and
 still more oppressive. According to the different nature of
 lands, their real produce in the various articles of wine or
 oil, corn or barley, wood or iron, was transported by the
 labour or at the expense of the provincials to the Imperial
 magazines, from whence they were occasionally distributed,
 for the use of the court, of the army, and of the two
 capitals, Rome and Constantinople. The commissioners of the
 revenue were so frequently obliged to make considerable
 purchases, that they were strictly prohibited from allowing
 any compensation, or from receiving in money the value of
 those supplies which were exacted in kind. In the primitive
 simplicity of small communities this method may be well
 adapted to collect the almost voluntary offerings of the
 people; but it is at once susceptible of the utmost latitude
 and of the utmost strictness, which in a corrupt and
 absolute monarchy must introduce a perpetual contest between
 the power of oppression and the arts of fraud. <small>(<a href="nt17/177.htm">177</a>)</small> The 
 agriculture of the Roman provinces was insensibly ruined,
 and, in the progress of despotism, which tends to disappoint
 its own purpose, the emperors were obliged to derive some
 merit from the forgiveness of debts, or the remission of
 tributes, which their subjects were utterly incapable of
 paying. According to the new division of Italy, the fertile
 and happy province of Campania, the scene of the early
 victories and of the delicious retirements of the citizens
 of Rome, extended between the sea and the Apennine from the
 Tiber to the Silarus. Within sixty years after the death of
 Constantine, and on the evidence of an actual survey, an
 exemption was granted in favour of three hundred and thirty
 thousand English acres of desert and uncultivated land,
 which amounted to one-eighth of the whole surface of the
 province. As the footsteps of the barbarians had not yet
 been seen in Italy, the cause of this amazing desolation,
 which is recorded in the laws, can be ascribed only to the
 administration of the Roman emperors. <small>(<a href="nt17/178.htm">178</a>)</small> 

</p><p id="asse"><small class="ok">Assessed in the form of a capitation.</small><br>
 
 Either from design or from accident, the mode of assessment
 seemed to unite the substance of a land tax with the forms
 of a capitation. <small>(<a href="nt17/179.htm">179</a>)</small> The returns which were sent of every 
 province or district expressed the number of tributary
 subjects, and the amount of the public impositions. The
 latter of these sums was divided by the former; and the
 estimate, that such a province contained so many capita, or
 heads of tribute, and that each head was rated at such a
 price was universally received, not only in the popular, but
 even in the legal computation. The value of a tributary head
 must have varied, according to many accidental, or at least
 fluctuating circumstances: but some knowledge has been
 preserved of a very curious fact, the more important since
 it relates to one of the richest provinces of the Roman
 empire, and which now flourishes as the most splendid of the
 European kingdoms. The rapacious ministers of Constantius
 had exhausted the wealth of Gaul, by exacting twenty-five
 pieces of gold for the annual tribute of every head. The
 humane policy of his successor reduced the capitation to
 seven pieces. <small>(<a href="nt17/180.htm">180</a>)</small> A moderate proportion between these 
 opposite extremes of extraordinary oppression and of
 transient indulgence may therefore be fixed at sixteen
 pieces of gold, or about nine pounds sterling, the common
 standard, perhaps, of the impositions of Gaul. <small>(<a href="nt17/181.htm">181</a>)</small> But this 
 calculation, or rather indeed the facts from whence it is
 deduced, cannot fail of suggesting two difficulties to a
 thinking mind, who will be at once surprised by the equality
 and by the enormity of the capitation. An attempt to explain
 them may perhaps reflect some light on the interesting
 subject of the finances of the declining empire.</p>

 <p>I. It is obvious that, as long as the immutable constitution
 of human nature produces and maintains so unequal a division
 of property, the most numerous part of the community would
 be deprived of their subsistence by the equal assessment of
 a tax from which the sovereign would derive a very trifling
 revenue. Such, indeed, might be the theory of the Roman
 capitation; but, in the practice, this unjust equality was
 no longer felt, as the tribute was collected on the
 principle of a real, not of a personal imposition. Several
 indigent citizens contributed to compose a single head, or
 share of taxation; while the wealthy provincial, in
 proportion to his fortune, alone represented several of
 those imaginary beings. In a poetical request, addressed to
 one of the last and most deserving of the Roman princes who
 reigned in Gaul, Sidonius Apollinaris personifies his
 tribute under the figure of a triple monster, the Geryon of
 the Grecian fables, and entreats the new Hercules that he
 would most graciously be pleased to save his life by cutting
 off three of his heads. <small>(<a href="nt17/182.htm">182</a>)</small> The fortune of Sidonius far 
 exceeded the customary wealth of a poet; but if he had
 pursued the allusion, he must have painted many of the
 Gallic nobles with the hundred heads of the deadly Hydra,
 spreading over the face of the country, and devouring the
 substance of an hundred families.  II. The difficulty of
 allowing an annual sum of about nine pounds sterling, even
 for the average of the capitation of Gaul, may be rendered
 more evident by the comparison of the present state of the
 same country, as it is now governed by the absolute monarch
 of an industrious, wealthy, and affectionate people. The
 taxes of France cannot be magnified, either by fear or by
 flattery, beyond the annual amount of eighteen millions
 sterling, which ought, perhaps to be shared among four-and-twenty millions
 of inhabitants. <small>(<a href="nt17/183.htm">183</a>)</small> Seven millions of these, in the capacity 
 of fathers, or brothers, or husbands, may discharge the
 obligations of the remaining multitude of women and
 children; yet the equal proportion of each tributary subject
 will scarcely rise above fifty shillings of our money,
 instead of a proportion almost four times as considerable,
 which was regularly imposed on their Gallic ancestors. The
 reason of this difference may be found, not so much in the
 relative scarcity or plenty of gold and silver, as in the
 different state of society in ancient Gaul and in modern
 France. In a country where personal freedom is the privilege
 of every subject, the whole mass of taxes, whether they are
 levied on property or on consumption, may be fairly divided
 among the whole body of the nation. But the far greater part
 of the lands of ancient Gaul, as well as of the other
 provinces of the Roman world, were cultivated by slaves, or
 by peasants, whose dependent condition was a less rigid
 servitude. <small>(<a href="nt17/184.htm">184</a>)</small> In such a state the poor were maintained at 
 the expense of the masters who enjoyed the fruits of their
 labour; and as the rolls of tribute were filled only with
 the names of those citizens who possessed the means of an
 honourable, or at least of a decent subsistence, the
 comparative smallness of their numbers explains and
 justifies the high rate of their capitation. The truth of
 this assertion may be illustrated by the following example:-
 The Aedui, one of the most powerful and civilised tribes or
 <i>cities</i> of Gaul, occupied an extent of territory which now
 contains above five hundred thousand inhabitants, in the two
 ecclesiastical dioceses of Autun and Nevers; <small>(<a href="nt17/185.htm">185</a>)</small> and with 
 the probable accession of those of Chalons and Macon, <small>(<a href="nt17/186.htm">186</a>)</small> 
 the population would amount to eight hundred thousand souls.
 In the time of Constantine the territory of the Aedui
 afforded no more than twenty-five thousand <i>heads</i> of
 capitation, of whom seven thousand were discharged by that
 prince from the intolerable weight of tribute. <small>(<a href="nt17/187.htm">187</a>)</small> A just 
 analogy would seem to countenance the opinion of an
 ingenious historian,  <small>(<a href="nt17/188.htm">188</a>)</small> that the free and tributary 
 citizens did not surpass the number of half a million; and
 if, in the ordinary administration of government, their
 annual payments may be computed at about four millions and a
 half of our money, it would appear that, although the share
 of each individual was four times as considerable, a fourth
 part only of the modern taxes of France was levied on the
 Imperial province of Gaul. The exactions of Constantius may
 be calculated at seven millions sterling, which were reduced
 to two millions by the humanity or the wisdom of Julian.

</p><p id="capi"><small class="ok">Capitation on trade and industry.</small><br>
 
 But this tax or capitation on the proprietors of land would
 have suffered a rich and numerous class of free citizens to
 escape. With the view of sharing that species of wealth
 which is derived from art or labour, and which exists in
 money or in merchandise, the emperors imposed a distinct and
 personal tribute on the trading part of their subjects. <small>(<a href="nt17/189.htm">189</a>)</small> 
 Some exemptions, very strictly confined both in time and
 place, were allowed to the proprietors who disposed of the
 produce of their own estates. Some indulgence was granted to
 the profession of the liberal arts; but every other branch
 of commercial industry was affected by the severity of the
 law. The honourable merchant of Alexandria, who imported the
 gems and spices of India for the use of the western world;
 the usurer, who derived from the interest of money a silent
 and ignominious profit, the ingenious manufacturer, the
 diligent mechanic, and even the most obscure retailer of a
 sequestered village, were obliged to admit the officers of
 the revenue into the partnership of their gain; and the
 sovereign of the Roman empire, who tolerated the profession,
 consented to share the infamous salary of public
 prostitutes. As this general tax upon industry was collected
 every fourth year, it was styled the <i>Lustral Contribution</i>:
 and the historian Zosimus <small>(<a href="nt17/190.htm">190</a>)</small> laments that the approach of 
 the fatal period was announced by the tears and terrors of
 the citizens, who were often compelled by the impending
 scourge to embrace the most abhorred and unnatural methods
 of procuring the sum at which their poverty had been
 assessed. The testimony of Zosimus cannot indeed be
 justified from the charge of passion and prejudice; but,
 from the nature of this tribute, it seems reasonable to
 conclude that it was arbitrary in the distribution, and
 extremely rigorous in the mode of collecting. The secret
 wealth of commerce, and the precarious profits of art or
 labour, are susceptible only of a discretionary valuation,
 which is seldom disadvantageous to the interest of the
 treasury; and as the person of the trader supplies the want
 of a visible and permanent security, the payment of the
 imposition, which, in the case of a land-tax, may be
 obtained by the seizure of property, can rarely be extorted
 by any other means than those of corporal punishments. The
 cruel treatment of the insolvent debtors of the state is
 attested, and was perhaps mitigated, by a very humane edict
 of Constantine, who, disclaiming the use of racks and of
 scourges, allots a spacious and airy prison for the place of
 their confinement. <small>(<a href="nt17/191.htm">191</a>)</small> 

</p><p id="free"><small class="ok">Free gifts.</small><br>
 
 These general taxes were imposed and levied by the absolute
 authority of the monarch; but the occasional offerings of
 the coronary gold still retained the name and semblance of
 popular consent. It was an ancient custom that the allies of
 the republic, who ascribed their safety or deliverance to
 the success of the Roman arms, and even the cities of Italy,
 who admired the virtues of their victorious general, adorned
 the pomp of his triumph by their voluntary gifts of crowns
 of gold, which, after the ceremony, were consecrated in the
 temple of Jupiter, to remain a lasting monument of his glory
 to future ages. The progress of zeal and flattery soon
 multiplied the number, and increased the size, of these
 popular donations; and the triumph of Caesar was enriched
 with two thousand eight hundred and twenty-two massy crowns,
 whose weight amounted to twenty thousand four hundred and
 fourteen pounds of gold. This treasure was immediately
 melted down by the prudent dictator, who was satisfied that
 it would be more serviceable to his soldiers than to the
 gods: his example was imitated by his successors, and the
 custom was introduced of exchanging these splendid ornaments
 for the more acceptable present of the current gold coin of
 the empire. <small>(<a href="nt17/192.htm">192</a>)</small> The spontaneous offering was at length 
 exacted as the debt of duty, and, instead of being confined
 to the occasion of a triumph, it was supposed to be granted
 by the several cities and provinces of the monarchy as often
 as the emperor condescended to announce his accession, his
 consulship, the birth of a son, the creation of a Caesar, a
 victory over the barbarians, or any other real or imaginary
 event which graced the annals of his reign. The peculiar
 free gift of the senate of Rome was fixed by custom at
 sixteen hundred pounds of gold, or about sixty-four thousand
 pounds sterling. The oppressed subjects celebrated their own
 felicity that their sovereign should graciously consent to
 accept this feeble but voluntary testimony of their loyalty
 and gratitude.  <small>(<a href="nt17/193.htm">193</a>)</small> 

</p><p id="conc"><small class="ok">Conclusion</small><br>
 
 A people elated by pride, or soured by discontent, is seldom qualified to form a just estimate of their actual situation. The subjects of Constantine were incapable of discerning the decline of genius and manly virtue, which so far degraded them below the dignity of their ancestors; but they could feel and lament the rage of tyranny, the relaxation of discipline, and the increase of taxes. The impartial historian, who acknowledges the justice of their complaints, will observe some favourable circumstances which tended to
 alleviate the misery of their condition. The threatening tempest of barbarians, which so soon subverted the foundations of Roman greatness, was still repelled, or suspended, on the frontiers. The arts of luxury and
 literature were cultivated, and the elegant pleasures of society were enjoyed, by the inhabitants of a considerable portion of the globe. The forms, the pomp, and the expense of the civil administration contributed to restrain the irregular licence of the soldiers; and although the laws were violated by power, or perverted by subtlety, the sage principles of the Roman jurisprudence preserved a sense of order and equity unknown to the despotic governments of the East. The rights of mankind might derive some protection
 from religion and philosophy; and the name of freedom, which could no longer alarm, might sometimes admonish, the successors of Augustus, that they did not reign over a nation of Slaves or Barbarians. <small>(<a href="nt17/194.htm">194</a>)</small></p>
