<p class="cite">
Conduct of the Roman government towards the Christians, from the reign of Nero to that of Constantine
</p>

 <p id="chri"><small class="ok">Christianity persecuted by the Roman emperors</small><br>

 IF we seriously consider the purity of the Christian
 religion, the sanctity of its moral precepts, and the
 innocent as well as austere lives of the greater number of
 those who during the first ages embraced the faith of the
 Gospel, we should naturally suppose that so benevolent a
 doctrine would have been received with due reverence even
 by the unbelieving world; that the learned and the polite,
 however they might deride the miracles, would have esteemed
 the virtues of the new sect; and that the magistrates,
 instead of persecuting, would have protected an order of men
 who yielded the most passive obedience to the laws, though
 they declined the active cares of war and government. If, on
 the other hand, we recollect the universal toleration of
 Polytheism, as it was invariably maintained by the faith of
 the people, the incredulity of philosophers, and the policy
 of the Roman senate and emperors, we are at a loss to
 discover what new offence the Christians had committed, what
 new provocation could exasperate the mild indifference of
 antiquity, and what new motives could urge the Roman
 princes, who beheld without concern a thousand forms of
 religion subsisting in peace under their gentle sway, to
 inflict a severe punishment on any part of their subjects
 who had chosen for themselves a singular but an inoffensive
 mode of faith and worship.
 
</p> <p>The religious policy of the ancient world seems to have
 assumed a more stern and intolerant character to oppose the
 progress of Christianity. About four-score years after the
 death of Christ, his innocent disciples were punished with
 death by the sentence of a proconsul of the most amiable and
 philosophic character, and according to the laws of an
 emperor distinguished by the wisdom and justice of his
 general administration. The apologies which were repeatedly
 addressed to the successors of Trajan are filled with the
 most pathetic complaints that the Christians, who obeyed the
 dictates and solicited the liberty of conscience, were
 alone, among all the subjects of the Roman empire, excluded
 from the common benefits of their auspicious government. The
 deaths of a few eminent martyrs have been recorded with
 care; and from the time that Christianity was invested with
 the supreme power, the governors of the church have been no
 less diligently employed in displaying the cruelty, than in
 imitating the conduct, of their Pagan adversaries. To
 separate (if it be possible) a few authentic as well as
 interesting facts from an undigested mass of fiction and
 error, and to relate, in a clear and rational manner, the
 causes, the extent, the duration, and the most important
 circumstances of the persecutions to which the first
 Christians were exposed, is the design of the present
 chapter.
 
</p> <p id="inqu"><small class="ok">Inquiry into their motives</small><br>

 The sectaries of a persecuted religion, depressed by fear,
 animated with resentment, and perhaps heated by enthusiasm,
 are seldom in a proper temper of mind calmly to investigate,
 or candidly to appreciate the motives of their enemies,
 which often escape the impartial and discerning view even of
 those who are placed at a secure distance from the flames of
 persecution. A reason has been assigned for the conduct of
 the emperors towards the primitive Christians, which may
 appear the more specious and probable as it is drawn from
 the acknowledged genius of Polytheism. It has already been
 observed that the religious concord of the world was
 principally supported by the implicit assent and reverence
 which the nations of antiquity expressed for their
 respective traditions and ceremonies. It might therefore be
 expected that they would unite with indignation against any
 sect of people which should separate itself from the
 communion of mankind, and claiming the exclusive possession
 of divine knowledge, should disdain every form of worship
 except its own as impious and idolatrous. The rights of
 toleration were held by mutual indulgence: they were justly
 forfeited by a refusal of the accustomed tribute. As the
 payment of this tribute was inflexibly refused by the Jews,
 and by them alone, the consideration of the treatment which
 they experienced from the Roman magistrates will serve to
 explain how far these speculations are justified by facts,
 and will lead us to discover the true causes of the
 persecution of Christianity.
 
</p> <p id="rebe"><small class="ok">Rebellious spirit of the jews</small><br>

 Without repeating what has been already mentioned of the
 reverence of the Roman princes and governors for the temple
 of Jerusalem, we shall only observe that the destruction of
 the temple and city was accompanied and followed by every
 circumstance that could exasperate the minds of the
 conquerors, and authorise religious persecutions by the most
 specious arguments of political justice and the public
 safety. From the reign of Nero to that of Antoninus Pius,
 the Jews discovered a fierce impatience of the dominion of
 Rome, which repeatedly broke out in the most furious
 massacres and insurrections. Humanity is shocked at the
 recital of the horrid cruelties which they committed in the
 cities of Egypt, of Cyprus, and of Cyrene, where they dwelt
 in treacherous friendship with the unsuspecting natives;<small>(<a href="nt16/001.htm">1</a>)</small> 
 and we are tempted to applaud the severe retaliation which
 was exercised by the arms of the legions against a race of
 fanatics whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to
 render them the implacable enemies not only of the Roman
 government, but of human kind.<small>(<a href="nt16/002.htm">2</a>)</small> The enthusiasm of the Jews 
 was supported by the opinion that it was unlawful for them
 to pay taxes to an idolatrous master, and by the flattering
 promise which they derived from their ancient oracles, that
 a conquering Messiah would soon arise, destined to break
 their fetters, and to invest the favourites of heaven with
 the empire of the earth. It was by announcing himself as
 their long-expected deliverer, and by calling on all the
 descendants of Abraham to assert the hope of Israel, that
 the famous Barchochebas collected a formidable army, with
 which he resisted during two years the power of the emperor
 Hadrian.<small>(<a href="nt16/003.htm">3</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="tole"><small class="ok">Toleration of the Jewish religion</small><br>
 
 Notwithstanding these repeated provocations, the resentment
 of the Roman princes expired after the victory, nor were
 their apprehensions continued beyond the period of war and
 danger. By the general indulgence of Polytheism, and by the
 mild temper of Antoninus Pius, the Jews were restored to
 their ancient privileges, and once more obtained the
 permission of circumcising their children, with the easy
 restraint that they should never confer on any foreign
 proselyte that distinguishing mark of the Hebrew race.<small>(<a href="nt16/004.htm">4</a>)</small> The 
 numerous remains of that people, though they were still
 excluded from the precincts of Jerusalem, were permitted to
 form and to maintain considerable establishments both in
 Italy and in the provinces, to acquire the freedom of Rome,
 to enjoy municipal honours, and to obtain at the same time
 an exemption from the burdensome and expensive offices of
 society. The moderation or the contempt of the Romans gave a
 legal sanction to the form of ecclesiastical policy which
 was instituted by the vanquished sect. The patriarch, who
 had fixed his residence at Tiberias, was empowered to
 appoint his subordinate ministers and apostles, to exercise
 a domestic jurisdiction, and to receive from his dispersed
 brethren an annual contribution. <small>(<a href="nt16/005.htm">5</a>)</small> New synagogues were 
 frequently erected in the principal cities of the empire;
 and the sabbaths, the fasts, and the festivals, which were
 either commanded by the Mosaic law or enjoined by the
 traditions of the Rabbis, were celebrated in the most solemn
 and public manner. <small>(<a href="nt16/006.htm">6</a>)</small> Such gentle treatment insensibly 
 assuaged the stern temper of the Jews. Awakened from their
 dream of prophecy and conquest, they assumed the behaviour
 of peaceable and industrious subjects. Their irreconcilable
 hatred of mankind, instead of flaming out in acts of blood
 and violence, evaporated in less dangerous gratifications.
 They embraced every opportunity of over-reaching the
 idolaters in trade, and they pronounced secret and ambiguous
 imprecations against the haughty kingdom of Edom.<small>(<a href="nt16/007.htm">7</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="thej"><small class="ok">The Jews were a people which folowed, the Christians, a sect which deserted, the religion of their fathers.</small><br>
 
Since the Jews, who rejected with abhorrence the deities
 adored by their sovereign and by their fellow-subjects,
 enjoyed, however, the free exercise of their unsocial
 religion, there must have existed some other cause which
 exposed the disciples of Christ to those severities from
 which the posterity of Abraham was exempt. The difference
 between them is simple and obvious, but, according to the
 sentiments of antiquity, it was of the highest importance.
 The Jews were a <i>nation</i>, the Christians were a sect: and if
 it was natural for every community to respect the sacred
 institutions of their neighbours, it was incumbent on them
 to persevere in those of their ancestors. The voice of
 oracles, the precepts of philosophers, and the authority of
 the laws, unanimously enforced this national obligation. By
 their lofty claim of superior sanctity the Jews might
 provoke the Polytheists to consider them as an odious and
 impure race. By disdaining the intercourse of other nations
 they might deserve their contempt. The laws of Moses might
 be for the most part frivolous or absurd yet, since they had
 been received during many ages by a large society, his
 followers were justified by the example of mankind, and it
 was universally acknowledged that they had a right to
 practise what it would have been criminal in them to
 neglect. But this principle, which protected the Jewish
 synagogue, afforded not any favour or security to the
 primitive church. By embracing the faith of the Gospel the
 Christians incurred the supposed guilt of an unnatural and
 unpardonable offence. They dissolved the sacred ties of
 custom and education, violated the religious institutions of
 their country, and presumptuously despised whatever their
 fathers had believed as true or had reverenced as sacred.
 Nor was this apostasy (if we may use the expression) merely
 of a partial or local kind; since the pious deserter who
 withdrew himself from the temples of Egypt or Syria would
 equally disdain to seek an asylum in those of Athens or
 Carthage. Every Christian rejected with contempt the
 superstitions of his family, his city, and his province. The
 whole body of Christians unanimously refused to hold any
 communion with the gods of Rome, of the empire, and of
 mankind. It was in vain that the oppressed believer asserted
 the inalienable rights of conscience and private judgment.
 Though his situation might excite the pity, his arguments
 could never reach the understanding, either of the
 philosophic or of the believing part of the Pagan world. To
 their apprehensions it was no less a matter of surprise that
 any individuals should entertain scruples against complying
 with the established mode of worship than if they had
 conceived a sudden abhorrence to the manners, the dress, or
 the language of their native country.<small>(<a href="nt16/008.htm">8</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="chris"><small class="ok">Christianity accused of atheism, and mistaken by the people and philosophers</small><br>
 
 The surprise of the Pagans was soon succeeded by resentment,
 and the most pious of men were exposed to the unjust but
 dangerous imputation of impiety. Malice and prejudice
 concurred in representing the Christians as a society of
 atheists, who, by the most daring attack on the religious
 constitution of the empire, had merited the severest
 animadversion of the civil magistrate. They had separated
 themselves (they gloried in the confession) from every mode
 of superstition which was received in any part of the globe
 by the various temper of Polytheism: but it was not
 altogether so evident what deity or what form of worship,
 they had substituted to the gods and temples of antiquity.
 The pure and sublime idea which they entertained of the
 Supreme Being escaped the gross conception of the Pagan
 multitude, who were at a loss to discover a spiritual and
 solitary God, that was neither represented under any
 corporeal figure or visible symbol, nor was adored with the
 accustomed pomp of libations and festivals, of altars and
 sacrifices.<small>(<a href="nt16/009.htm">9</a>)</small> The sages of Greece and Rome, who had elevated 
 their minds to the contemplation of the existence and
 attributes of the First Cause, were induced by reason or by
 vanity to reserve for themselves and their chosen disciples
 the privilege of this philosophical devotion.<small>(<a href="nt16/010.htm">10</a>)</small> They were 
 far from admitting the prejudices of mankind as the standard
 of truth, but they considered them as flowing from the
 original disposition of human nature; and they supposed that
 any popular mode of faith and worship which presumed to
 disclaim the assistance of the senses would, in proportion
 as it receded from superstition, find itself incapable of
 restraining the wonderings of the fancy and the visions of
 fanaticism. The careless glance which men of wit and
 learning condescended to cast on the Christian revelation
 served only to confirm their hasty opinion, and to persuade
 them that the principle, which they might have revered, of
 the Divine Unity, was defaced by the wild enthusiasm, and
 annihilated by the airy speculations, of the new sectaries.
 The author of a celebrated dialogue, which has been
 attributed to Lucian, whilst he affects to treat the
 mysterious subject of the Trinity in a style of ridicule and
 contempt, betrays his own ignorance of the weakness of human
 reason, and of the inscrutable nature of the Divine
 perfections.<small>(<a href="nt16/011.htm">11</a>)</small> 
 
 </p> <p>It might appear less surprising that the founder of
 Christianity should not only be revered by his disciples as
 a sage and a prophet, but that he should be adored as a God.
 The Polytheists were disposed to adopt every article of
 faith which seemed to offer any resemblance, however distant
 or imperfect, with the popular mythology; and the legends of
 Bacchus, of Hercules, and of Aesculapius had, in some
 measure prepared their imagination for the appearance of the
 Son of God under a human form.<small>(<a href="nt16/012.htm">12</a>)</small> But they were astonished 
 that the Christians should abandon the temples of those
 ancient heroes who, in the infancy of the world, had
 invented arts, instituted laws, and vanquished the tyrants
 or monsters who infested the earth; in order to choose for
 the exclusive object of their religious worship an obscure
 teacher, who, in a recent age, and among a barbarous people,
 had fallen a sacrifice either to the malice of his own
 countrymen, or to the jealousy of the Roman government. The
 Pagan multitude, reserving their gratitude for temporal
 benefits alone, rejected the inestimable present of life and
 immortality which was offered to mankind by Jesus of
 Nazareth. His mild constancy in the midst of cruel and
 voluntary sufferings, his universal benevolence, and the
 sublime simplicity of his actions and character, were
 insufficient in the opinion of those carnal men, to
 compensate for the want of fame, of empire, and of success;
 and whilst they refused to acknowledge his stupendous
 triumph over the powers of darkness and of the grave, they
 misrepresented, or they insulted, the equivocal birth,
 wandering life, and ignominious death, of the divine Author
 of Christianity.<small>(<a href="nt16/013.htm">13</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="theu"><small class="ok">The union and assemblies of the Christians considered as a dangerous conspiracy.</small><br>
 
 The personal guilt which every Christian had contracted, in
 thus preferring his private sentiment to the national
 religion, was aggravated in a very high degree by the number
 and union of the criminals. It is well known, and has been
 already observed, that Roman policy viewed with the utmost
 jealousy and distrust any association among its subjects;
 and that the privileges of private corporations, though
 formed for the most harmless or beneficial purposes, were
 bestowed with a very sparing hand. <small>(<a href="nt16/014.htm">14</a>)</small> The religious 
 assemblies of the Christians, who had separated themselves
 from the public worship, appeared of a much less innocent
 nature: they were illegal in their principle, and in their
 consequences might become dangerous; nor were the emperors
 conscious that they violated the laws of justice, when, for
 the peace of society, they prohibited those secret and
 sometimes nocturnal meetings. <small>(<a href="nt16/015.htm">15</a>)</small> The pious disobedience of 
 the Christians made their conduct, or perhaps their designs,
 appear in a much more serious and criminal light; and the
 Roman princes, who might perhaps have suffered themselves to
 be disarmed by a ready submission, deeming their honour
 concerned in the execution of their commands, sometimes
 attempted, by rigorous punishments, to subdue this
 independent spirit, which boldly acknowledged an authority
 superior to that of the magistrate. The extent and duration
 of this spiritual conspiracy seemed to render it every day
 more deserving of his animadversion. We have already seen
 that the active and successful zeal of the Christians had
 insensibly diffused them through every province and almost
 every city of the empire. The new converts seemed to
 renounce their family and country, that they might connect
 themselves in an indissoluble band of union with a peculiar
 society, which everywhere assumed a different character from
 the rest of mankind. Their gloomy and austere aspect, their
 abhorrence of the common business and pleasures of life, and
 their frequent predictions of impending calamities, <small>(<a href="nt16/016.htm">16</a>)</small> 
 inspired the Pagans with the apprehension of some danger
 which would arise from the new sect, the more alarming as it
 was the more obscure. </p>
<blockquote> " Whatever," <em>says Pliny, </em> "may be the principle of their conduct, their inflexible obstinacy appeared deserving of punishment." <em><small>(<a href="nt16/017.htm">17</a>)</small> </em> </blockquote>

 <p id="thei"><small class="ok">Their manners calumniated</small><br>
 
 The precautions with which the disciples of Christ performed
 the offices of religion were at first dictated by fear and
 necessity; but they were continued from choice. By imitating
 the awful secrecy which reigned in the Eleusinian mysteries,
 the Christians had flattered themselves that they should
 render their sacred institutions more respectable in the
 eyes of the Pagan World. <small>(<a href="nt16/018.htm">18</a>)</small> But the event, as it often 
 happens to the operations of subtle policy, deceived their
 wishes and their expectations. It was concluded that they
 only concealed what they would have blushed to disclose.
 Their mistaken prudence afforded an opportunity for malice
 to invent, and for suspicious credulity to believe, the
 horrid tales which described the Christians as the most
 wicked of human kind, who practised in their dark recesses
 every abomination that a depraved fancy could suggest, and
 who solicited the favour of their unknown God by the
 sacrifice of every moral virtue. There were many who
 pretended to confess or to relate the ceremonies of this
 abhorred society. It was asserted, </p>
<blockquote> "that a newborn infant, entirely covered over with flour, was presented, like some mystic symbol of initiation, to the knife of the proselyte, who unknowingly inflicted many a secret and mortal wound on the innocent victim of his error; that as soon as the cruel deed was perpetrated, the sectaries drank up the blood, greedily tore asunder the quivering members, and pledged themselves to eternal secrecy, by a mutual consciousness of guilt. It was as confidently affirmed that this inhuman sacrifice was succeeded by a suitable entertainment, in which intemperance served as a provocative to brutal lust; till, at the appointed moment, the lights were suddenly extinguished, shame was banished, nature was forgotten; and, as accident might direct, the darkness of the night was polluted by the incestuous commerce of sisters and brothers, of sons and of mothers." <em><small>(<a href="nt16/019.htm">19</a>)</small></em></blockquote>

 <p id="their"><small class="ok">Their imprudent defence</small><br>
 
 But the perusal of the ancient apologies was sufficient to
 remove even the slightest suspicion from the mind of a
 candid adversary. The Christians, with the intrepid security
 of innocence, appeal from the voice of rumour to the equity
 of the magistrates. They acknowledge that, if any proof can
 be produced of the crimes which calumny has imputed to them,
 they are worthy of the most severe punishment. They provoke
 the punishment, and they challenge the proof. At the same
 time they urge, with equal truth and propriety, that the
 charge is not less devoid of probability than it is
 destitute of evidence; they ask whether any one can
 seriously believe that the pure and holy precepts of the
 Gospel, which so frequently restrain the use of the most
 lawful enjoyments, should inculcate the practice of the most
 abominable crimes; that a large society should resolve to
 dishonour itself in the eyes of its own members; and that a
 great number of persons, of either sex, and every age and
 character, insensible to the fear of death or infamy, should
 consent to violate those principles which nature and
 education had imprinted most deeply in their minds. <small>(<a href="nt16/020.htm">20</a>)</small> 
 Nothing, it should seem, could weaken the force or destroy
 the effect of so unanswerable a justification, unless it
 were the injudicious conduct of the apologists themselves,
 who betrayed the common cause of religion, to gratify their
 devout hatred to the domestic enemies of the church. It was
 sometimes faintly insinuated, and sometimes boldly asserted,
 that the same bloody sacrifices, and the same incestuous
 festivals, which were so falsely ascribed to the orthodox
 believers, were in reality celebrated by the Marcionites, by
 the Carpocratians, and by several other sects of the
 Gnostics, who, notwithstanding they might deviate into the
 paths of heresy, were still actuated by the sentiments of
 men, and still governed by the precepts of Christianity.<small>(<a href="nt16/021.htm">21</a>)</small> 
 Accusations of a similar kind were retorted upon the church
 by the schismatics who had departed from its communion,<small>(<a href="nt16/022.htm">22</a>)</small> 
 and it was confessed on all sides that the most scandalous
 licentiousness of manners prevailed among great numbers of
 those who affected the name of Christians. A Pagan
 magistrate, who possessed neither leisure nor abilities to
 discern the almost imperceptible line which divides the
 orthodox faith from heretical depravity, might easily have
 imagined that their mutual animosity had extorted the
 discovery of their common guilt. It was fortunate for the
 reposes or at least for the reputation, of the first
 Christians, that the magistrates sometimes proceeded with
 more temper and moderation than is usually consistent with
 religious zeal, and that they reported, as the impartial
 result of their judicial inquiry, that the sectaries who had
 deserted the established worship appeared to them sincere in
 their professions and blameless in their manners, however
 they might incur, by their absurd and excessive
 superstition, the censure of the laws.<small>(<a href="nt16/023.htm">23</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="idea"><small class="ok">Idea of the conduct of the emperors towards the Christians</small><br>

 History, which undertakes to record the transactions of the
 past, for the instruction of future ages, would ill deserve
 that honourable office if she condescended to plead the
 cause of tyrants, or to justify the maxims of persecution.
 It must, however, be acknowledged that the conduct of the
 emperors who appeared the least favourable to the primitive
 church is by no means so criminal as that of modern
 sovereigns who have employed the arm of violence and terror
 against the religious opinions of any part of their
 subjects. From their reflections, or even from their own
 feelings, a Charles V. or a Louis XIV. might have acquired a
 just knowledge of the rights of conscience, of the
 obligation of faith, .and of the innocence of error. But the
 princes and magistrates of ancient Rome were strangers to
 those principles which inspired and authorised the
 inflexible obstinacy of the Christians in the cause of
 truth, nor could they themselves discover in their own
 breasts any motives which would have prompted them to refuse
 a legal, and as it were a natural, submission to the sacred
 institutions of their country. The same reason which
 contributes to alleviate the guilt, must have tended to
 abate the rigour, of their persecutions. As they were
 actuated, not by the furious zeal of bigots, but by the
 temperate policy of legislators, contempt must often have
 relaxed, and humanity must frequently have suspended, the
 execution of those laws which they enacted against the
 humble and obscure followers of Christ. From the general
 view of their character and motives we might naturally
 conclude: I. That a considerable time elapsed before they
 considered the new sectaries as an object deserving of the
 attention of government. II.  That in the conviction of any
 of their subjects who were accused of so very singular a
 crime, they proceeded with caution and reluctance.  III.  That
 they were moderate in the use of punishments; and IV.  That
 the afflicted church enjoyed many intervals of peace and
 tranquillity. Notwithstanding the careless indifference
 which the most copious and the most minute of the Pagan
 writers have shown to the affairs of the Christians,<small>(<a href="nt16/024.htm">24</a>)</small> it 
 may still be in our power to confirm each of these probable
 suppositions by the evidence of authentic facts.
 
</p> <p id="they"><small class="ok">They neglected the Christians as a sect of Jews</small><br>
 
  I. By the wise dispensation of Providence, a mysterious veil
 was cast over the infancy of the church, which, till the
 faith of the Christians was matured, and their numbers were
 multiplied, served to protect them not only from the malice
 but even from the knowledge of the Pagan world. The slow and
 gradual abolition of the Mosaic ceremonies afforded a safe
 and innocent disguise to the more early proselytes of the
 Gospel. As they were for the greater part of the race of
 Abraham, they were distinguished by the peculiar mark of
 circumcision, offered up their devotions in the Temple of
 Jerusalem till its final destruction, and received both the
 Law and the Prophets as the genuine inspirations of the
 Deity. The Gentile converts who by a spiritual adoption had
 been associated to the hope of Israel, were likewise
 confounded under the garb and appearance of Jews;<small>(<a href="nt16/025.htm">25</a>)</small> and as 
 the Polytheists paid less regard to articles of faith than
 to the external worship, the new sect, which carefully
 concealed, or faintly announced, its future greatness and
 ambition, was permitted to shelter itself under the general
 toleration which was granted to an ancient and celebrated
 people in the Roman empire. It was not long, perhaps, before
 the Jews themselves, animated with a fiercer zeal and a more
 jealous faith, perceived the gradual separation of their
 Nazarene brethren from the doctrine of the synagogue: and
 they would gladly have extinguished the dangerous heresy in
 the blood of its adherents. But the decrees of Heaven had
 already disarmed their malice; and though they might
 sometimes exert the licentious privilege of sedition, they
 no longer possessed the administration of criminal justice;
 nor did they find it easy to infuse into the calm breast of
 a Roman magistrate the rancour of their own zeal and
 prejudice. The provincial governors declared themselves
 ready to listen to any accusation that might affect the
 public safety, but as soon as they were informed that it was
 a question not of facts but of words, a dispute relating
 only to the interpretation of the Jewish laws and
 prophecies, they deemed it unworthy of the majesty of Rome
 seriously to discuss the obscure differences which might
 arise among a barbarous and superstitious people. The
 innocence of the first Christians was protected by ignorance
 and contempt; and the tribunal of the Pagan magistrate often
 proved their most assured refuge against the fury of the
 synagogue.<small>(<a href="nt16/026.htm">26</a>)</small> If, indeed, we were disposed to adopt the 
 traditions of a too credulous antiquity, we might relate the
 distant peregrinations, the wonderful achievements, and the
 various deaths of the twelve apostles: but a more accurate
 inquiry will induce us to doubt whether any of those persons
 who had been witnesses to the miracles of Christ were
 permitted, beyond the limits of Palestine, to seal with
 their blood the truth of their testimony. <small>(<a href="nt16/027.htm">27</a>)</small> From the 
 ordinary term of human life, it may very naturally be
 presumed that most of them were deceased before the
 discontent of the Jews broke out into that furious war which
 was terminated only by the ruin of Jerusalem. During a long
 period, from the death of Christ to that memorable
 rebellion, we cannot discover any traces of Roman
 intolerance, unless they are to be found in the sudden, the
 transient, but the cruel persecution, which was exercised by
 Nero against the Christians of the capital, thirty-five
 years after the former, and only two years before the
 latter, of those great events. The character of the
 philosophic historian, to whom we are principally indebted
 for the knowledge of this singular transaction, would alone
 be sufficient to recommend it to our most attentive
 consideration.
 
</p> <p id="thef"><small class="ok">The fire of Rome under the reign of Nero</small><br>
 
 In the tenth year of the reign of Nero the capital of the
 empire was afflicted by a fire which raged beyond the memory
 or example of former ages.<small>(<a href="nt16/028.htm">28</a>)</small> The monuments of Grecian art 
 and of Roman virtue, the trophies of the Punic and Gallic
 wars, the most holy temples, and the most splendid palaces
 were involved in one common destruction. Of the fourteen
 regions or quarters into which Rome was divided, four only
 subsisted entire, three were levelled with the ground, and
 the remaining seven, which had experienced the fury of the
 flames, displayed a melancholy prospect of ruin and
 desolation. The vigilance of government appears not to have
 neglected any of the precautions which might alleviate the
 sense of so dreadful a calamity. The Imperial gardens were
 thrown open to the distressed multitude, temporary buildings
 were erected for their accommodation, and a plentiful supply
 of corn and provisions was distributed at a very moderate
 price.<small>(<a href="nt16/029.htm">29</a>)</small> The most generous policy seemed to have dictated 
 the edicts which regulated the disposition of the streets
 and the construction of private houses; and, as it usually
 happens in an age of prosperity, the conflagration of Rome,
 in the course of a few years, produced a new city, more
 regular and more beautiful than the former. But all the
 prudence and humanity affected by Nero on this occasion were
 insufficient to preserve him from the popular suspicion.
 Every crime might be imputed to the assassin of his wife and
 mother; nor could the prince who prostituted his person and
 dignity on the theatre be deemed incapable of the most
 extravagant folly. The voice of rumour accused the emperor
 as the incendiary of his own capital; and, as the most
 incredible stories are the best adapted to the genius of an
 enraged people, it was gravely reported, and firmly
 believed, that Nero, enjoying the calamity which he had
 occasioned, amused himself with singing to his lyre the
 destruction of ancient Troy.<small>(<a href="nt16/030.htm">30</a>)</small> To divert a suspicion which the power of despotism was unable to suppress, the emperor resolved to substitute in his own place some fictitious
 criminals.</p>
<p id="crue"><small class="ok">Cruel punishment of the Christians, as the incendiaries of the city.</small><br>

<blockquote style="margin-top:-1.5ex">"With this view <em>(continues Tacitus) </em> he inflicted the most exquisite tortures on those men who, under the
 vulgar appellation of Christians, were already branded with deserved infamy. They derived their name and origin from Christ, who, in the reign of Tiberius, had suffered death by the sentence of the procurator Pontius Pilate. <em><small>(<a href="nt16/031.htm">31</a>)</small></em> For a while this dire superstition was checked, but it again burst forth; and not only spread itself over Judaea, the first seat of this mischievous sect, but was even introduced into Rome, the common asylum which receives and protects whatever is impure, whatever is atrocious. The confessions of those who were seized discovered a great multitude of their accomplices, and they were all convicted, not so much for the crime of setting fire to the city as for their hatred of human kind. <em><small>(<a href="nt16/032.htm">32</a>)</small> </em> They died in torments, and their torments were embittered by insult and derision. Some were nailed on crosses; others sewn up in the skins of wild beasts, and exposed to the fury of dogs; others again, smeared over with combustible materials, were used as torches to illuminate the darkness of the night. The gardens of Nero were destined for the melancholy spectacle, which was accompanied with a horserace, and honoured with the presence of the emperor, who mingled with the populace in the dress and attitude of a charioteer. The guilt of the Christians deserved indeed the most exemplary punishment, but the public abhorrence was changed into commiseration, from the opinion that those unhappy wretches were sacrificed, not so much to the public welfare as to the cruelty of a jealous tyrant." <em><small>(<a href="nt16/033.htm">33</a>)</small> </em> </blockquote>

<p>Those who survey with a curious eye the revolutions of mankind may observe that the gardens and circus of Nero on the Vatican, which were polluted with the blood of the first Christians, have been rendered still more famous by the triumph and by the abuse of the persecuted religion. On the same spot <small>(<a href="nt16/034.htm">34</a>)</small> a temple, which far surpasses the ancient glories of the Capitol, has been since erected by the Christian Pontiffs, who, deriving their claim of universal dominion from an humble fisherman of Galilee, have succeeded to the throne of the Caesars, given laws to the barbarian conquerors of Rome, and extended their spiritual jurisdiction from the coast of the Baltic to the shores of the Pacific Ocean.
 
 </p> <p>But it would be improper to dismiss this account of Nero's
 persecution till we have made some observations that may
 serve to remove the difficulties with which it is perplexed,
 and to throw some light on the subsequent history of the
 church.
 
</p> <p id="rema"><small class="ok">Remarks on the passage of Tacitus relative to the persecution of the Christians by Nero</small><br>
 
1. The most sceptical criticism is obliged to respect the truth of this extraordinary fact, and the integrity of this celebrated passage of Tacitus. The former is confirmed by the diligent and accurate Suetonius, who mentions the punishment which Nero inflicted on the Christians, a sect of men who had embraced a new and criminal superstition.<small>(<a href="nt16/035.htm">35</a>)</small> The latter may be proved by the consent of the most ancient manuscripts; by the inimitable character of the style of
 Tacitus; by his reputation, which guarded his text from the interpolations of pious fraud; and by the purport of his narration, which accused the first Christians of the most atrocious crimes, without insinuating that they possessed any miraculous or even magical powers above the rest of mankind.<small>(<a href="nt16/036.htm">36</a>)</small> 2. Notwithstanding it is probable that Tacitus was born some years before the fire of Rome,<small>(<a href="nt16/037.htm">37</a>)</small> he could  derive only from reading and conversation the knowledge of an event which happened during his infancy. Before he gave himself to the public he calmly waited till his genius had attained its full maturity, and he was more than forty years of age when a grateful regard for the memory of the virtuous Agricola extorted from him the most early of those historical compositions which will delight and instruct the most distant posterity. After making a trial of his strength in the life of Agricola, and the description of Germany, he conceived, and at length executed, a more arduous work, the history of Rome, in thirty books, from the fall of Nero to the accession of Nerva. The administration of Nerva introduced an age of justice and prosperity, which Tacitus had destined for the occupation of his old age;<small>(<a href="nt16/038.htm">38</a>)</small> but when he took a nearer view of his subject, judging, perhaps, that it was a more honourable or a less invidious office to record the vices of past tyrants than to celebrate the virtues of a reigning monarch, he chose rather to relate, under the form of annals, the actions of the four immediate successors of Augustus. To collect, to dispose, and to adorn a series of four-score years in an immortal work, every sentence of which is pregnant with the deepest observations and the most lively images, was an undertaking sufficient to exercise the genius of Tacitus himself during the greatest
 part of his life. In the last years of the reign of Trajan,
 whilst the victorious monarch extended the power of Rome
 beyond its ancient limits, the historian was describing, in
 the second and fourth books of his Annals, the tyranny of
 Tiberius;<small>(<a href="nt16/039.htm">39</a>)</small> and the emperor Hadrian must have succeeded to the throne before Tacitus, in the regular prosecution of his work, could relate the fire of the capital and the cruelty
 of Nero towards the unfortunate Christians. At the distance of sixty years it was the duty of the annalist to adopt the narratives of contemporaries; but it was natural for the philosopher to indulge himself in the description of the origin, the progress, and the character of the new sect, not so much according to the knowledge or prejudices of the age of Nero, as according to those of the time of Hadrian. 3. Tacitus very frequently trusts to the curiosity or reflection of his readers to supply those intermediate circumstances and ideas which, in his extreme conciseness, he has thought proper to suppress. We may therefore presume to imagine some probable cause which could direct the cruelty of Nero against the Christians of Rome, whose obscurity, as well as innocence, should have shielded them from his indignation, and even from his notice. The Jews, who were numerous in the capital and oppressed in their own country, were a much fitter object for the suspicions of the emperor and of the people: nor did it seem unlikely that a vanquished nation, who already discovered their abhorrence of the Roman yoke, might have recourse to the most atrocious means of gratifying their implacable revenge. But the Jews possessed very powerful advocates in the palace, and even in the heart of the tyrant; his wife and mistress, the beautiful Poppaea, and a favourite player of the race of Abraham, who had already employed their intercession on behalf of the obnoxious people.<small>(<a href="nt16/040.htm">40</a>)</small> In their room it was 
 necessary to offer some other victims, and it might easily be suggested that, although the genuine followers of Moses were innocent of the fire of Rome, there had arisen among them a new and pernicious sect of GALILEANS, which was capable of the most horrid crimes Under the appellation of GALILEANS two distinctions of men were confounded, the most opposite to each other in their manners and principles; the disciples who had embraced the faith of Jesus of Nazareth, <small>(<a href="nt16/041.htm">41</a>)</small> and the zealots who had followed the standard of Judas the Gaulonite.<small>(<a href="nt16/042.htm">42</a>)</small> The former were the friends, the latter  were the enemies, of human kind; and the only resemblance between them consisted in the same inflexible constancy which, in the defence of their cause, rendered them insensible of death and tortures. The followers of Judas, who impelled their countrymen into rebellion, were soon buried under the ruins of Jerusalem; whilst those of Jesus, known by the more celebrated name of Christians, diffused themselves over the Roman empire. How natural was it for Tacitus, in the time of Hadrian, to appropriate to the Christians the guilt and the sufferings which he might, with far greater truth and justice, have attributed to a sect whose odious memory was almost extinguished! 4.Whatever opinion may be entertained of this conjecture (for it is no more than a conjecture), it is evident that the effect, as well as the cause, of Nero's persecution, were confined to
 the walls of Rome ; <small>(<a href="nt16/043.htm">43</a>)</small> that the religious tenets of the Galilaeans, or Christians, were never made a subject of punishment, or even of inquiry; and that, as the idea of their sufferings was, for a long time, connected with the idea of cruelty and injustice, the moderation of succeeding princes inclined them to spare a sect oppressed by a tyrant whose rage had been usually directed against virtue and innocence.
 
</p> <p id="oppr"><small class="ok">Oppression of the Jews and Christians by Domitian</small><br>
 
 It is somewhat remarkable that the flames of war consumed
 almost at the same time the Temple of Jerusalem and the
 Capitol of Rome ; <small>(<a href="nt16/044.htm">44</a>)</small> and it appears no less singular that 
 the tribute which devotion had destined to the former should
 have been converted by the power of an assaulting victor to
 restore and adorn the splendour of the latter. <small>(<a href="nt16/045.htm">45</a>)</small> The 
 emperors levied a general capitation tax on the Jewish
 people; and although the sum assessed on the head of each
 individual was inconsiderable, the use for which it was
 designed, and the severity with which it was exacted, were
 considered as an intolerable grievance. <small>(<a href="nt16/046.htm">46</a>)</small> Since the 
 officers of the revenue extended their unjust claim to many
 persons who were strangers to the blood or religion of the
 Jews, it was impossible that the Christians, who had so
 often sheltered themselves under the shade of the synagogue,
 should now escape this rapacious persecution. Anxious as
 they were to avoid the slightest infection of idolatry,
 their conscience forbade them to contribute to the honour of
 that daemon who had assumed the character of the Capitoline
 Jupiter. As a very numerous though declining party among the
 Christians still adhered to the law of Moses, their efforts
 to dissemble their Jewish origin were detected by the
 decisive test of circumcision; <small>(<a href="nt16/047.htm">47</a>)</small> nor were the Roman 
 magistrates at leisure to inquire into the difference of
 their religious tenets. Among the Christians who were
 brought before the tribunal of the emperor, or, as it seems
 more probable, before that of the procurator of Judaea, two
 persons are said to have appeared, distinguished by their
 extraction, which was more truly noble than that of the
 greatest monarchs. These were the grandsons of St. Jude the
 apostle, who himself was the brother of Jesus Christ.<small>(<a href="nt16/048.htm">48</a>)</small> 
 Their natural pretensions to the throne of David might
 perhaps attract the respect of the people, and excite the
 jealousy of the governor; but the meanness of their garb and
 the simplicity of their answers soon convinced him that they
 were neither desirous nor capable of disturbing the peace of
 the Roman empire. They frankly confessed their royal origin,
 and their near relation to the Messiah, but they disclaimed
 any temporal views, and professed that his kingdom, which
 they devoutly expected, was purely of a spiritual and
 angelic nature. When they were examined concerning their
 fortune and occupation, they showed their hands hardened
 with daily labour, and declared that they derived their
 whole subsistence from the cultivation of a farm near the
 village of Cocaba, of the extent of about twenty-four
 English acres,<small>(<a href="nt16/049.htm">49</a>)</small> and of the value of nine thousand drachms, 
 or three hundred pounds sterling. The grandsons of St. Jude
 were dismissed with compassion and contempt.<small>(<a href="nt16/050.htm">50</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="exec"><small class="ok">Execution of Clemens the consul</small><br>

But, although the obscurity of the house of David might
 protect them from the suspicions of a tyrant, the present
 greatness of his own family alarmed the pusillanimous temper
 of Domitian, which could only be appeased by the blood of
 those Romans whom he either feared, or hated, or esteemed.
 Of the two sons of his uncle Flavius Sabinus,<small>(<a href="nt16/051.htm">51</a>)</small> the elder 
 was soon convicted of treasonable intentions, and the
 younger, who bore the name of Flavius Clemens, was indebted
 for his safety to his want of courage and ability.<small>(<a href="nt16/052.htm">52</a>)</small> The 
 emperor for a long time distinguished so harmless a kinsman
 by his favour and protection, bestowed on him his own niece
 Domitilla, adopted the children of that marriage to the hope
 of the succession, and invested their father with the
 honours of the consulship. But he had scarcely finished the
 term of his annual magistracy, when on a slight pretence he
 was condemned and executed; Domitilla was banished to a
 desolate island on the coast of Campania ;<small>(<a href="nt16/053.htm">53</a>)</small> and sentences 
 either of death or of confiscation were pronounced against a
 great number of persons who were involved in the same
 accusation. The guilt imputed to their charge was that of
 <I>Atheism</I> and <I>Jewish manners</I>; <small>(<a href="nt16/054.htm">54</a>)</small> a singular association of 
 ideas, which cannot with any propriety be applied except to
 the Christians, as they were obscurely and imperfectly
 viewed by the magistrates and by the writers of that period.
 On the strength of so probable an interpretation, and too
 eagerly admitting the suspicions of a tyrant as an evidence
 of their honourable crime, the church has placed both
 Clemens and Domitilla among its first martyrs, and has
 branded the cruelty of Domitian with the name of the second
 persecution. But this persecution (if it deserves that
 epithet) was of no long duration. A few months after the
 death of Clemens and the banishment of Domitilla, Stephen, a
 freedman belonging to the latter, who had enjoyed the
 favour, but who had not surely embraced the faith, of his
 mistress, assassinated the emperor in his palace.<small>(<a href="nt16/055.htm">55</a>)</small> The 
 memory of Domitian was condemned by the senate; his acts
 were rescinded; his exiles recalled; and under the gentle
 administration of Nerva, while the innocent were restored to
 their rank and fortunes, even the most guilty either
 obtained pardon or escaped punishment.<small>(<a href="nt16/056.htm">56</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="igno"><small class="ok">Ignorance of Pliny concerning the Christians</small><br>
 
 II. About ten years afterwards, under the reign of Trajan,
 the younger Pliny was intrusted by his friend and master
 with the government of Bithynia and Pontus. He soon found
 himself at a loss to determine by what rule of justice or of
 law he should direct his conduct in the execution of an
 office the most repugnant to his humanity. Pliny had never
 assisted at any judicial proceedings against the Christians,
 with whose name alone he seems to be acquainted; and he was
 totally uninformed with regard to the nature of their guilt,
 the method of their conviction, and the degree of their
 punishment. In this perplexity he had recourse to his usual
 expedient, of submitting to the wisdom of Trajan an
 impartial, and, in some respects, a favourable account of
 the new superstition, requesting the emperor that he would
 condescend to resolve his doubts and to instruct his
 ignorance.<small>(<a href="nt16/057.htm">57</a>)</small>The life of Pliny had been employed in the acquisition of learning, and in the business of the; world. Since the age
 of nineteen he had pleaded with distinction in the tribunals
 of Rome,<small>(<a href="nt16/058.htm">58</a>)</small> filled a place in the senate, had been invested 
 with the honours of the consulship, and had formed very
 numerous connections with every order of men, both in Italy
 and in the provinces. From <I>his</I> ignorance therefore we may
 derive some useful information. We may assure ourselves that
 when he accepted the government of Bithynia there were no
 general laws or decrees of the senate in force against the
 Christians; that neither Trajan nor any of his virtuous
 predecessors, whose edicts were received into the civil and
 criminal jurisprudence, had publicly declared their
 intentions concerning the new sect; and that, whatever
 proceedings had been carried on against the Christians,
 there were none of sufficient weight and authority to
 establish a precedent for the conduct of a Roman magistrate.
 
</p> <p id="traj"><small class="ok">Trajan and his successors establish a legal mode of proceeding against them.</small><br>
 
 The answer of Trajan, to which the Christians of the
 succeeding age have frequently appealed, discovers as much
 regard for justice and humanity as could be reconciled with
 his mistaken notions of religious policy. <small>(<a href="nt16/059.htm">59</a>)</small> Instead of 
 displaying the implacable zeal of an Inquisitor, anxious to
 discover the most minute particles of heresy, and exulting
 in the number of his victims, the emperor expresses much
 more solicitude to protect the security of the innocent than
 to prevent the escape of the guilty. He acknowledges the
 difficulty of fixing any general plan; but he lays down two
 salutary rules, which often afforded relief and support to
 the distressed Christians. Though he directs the magistrate
 to punish such persons as are legally convicted, he
 prohibits them, with a very humane inconsistency, from
 making any inquiries concerning the supposed criminals. Nor
 was the magistrate allowed to proceed on every kind of
 information. Anonymous charges the emperor rejects, as too
 repugnant to the equity of his government; and he strictly
 requires, for the conviction of those to whom the guilt of
 Christianity is imputed, the positive evidence of a fair and
 open accuser. It is likewise probable that the persons who
 assumed so invidious an office were obliged to declare the
 grounds of their suspicions, to specify (both in respect to
 time and place) the secret assemblies which their Christian
 adversary had frequented, and to disclose a great number of
 circumstances which were concealed with the most vigilant
 jealousy from the eye of the profane. If they succeeded in
 their prosecution, they were exposed to the resentment of a
 considerable and active party, to the censure of the more
 liberal portion of mankind, and to the ignominy which, in
 every age and country, has attended the character of an
 informer. If, on the contrary, they failed in their proofs,
 they incurred the severe and perhaps capital penalty, which,
 according to a law published by the emperor Hadrian, was
 inflicted on those who falsely attributed to their
 fellow-citizens the crime of Christianity. The violence of
 personal or superstitious animosity might sometimes prevail
 over the most natural apprehensions of disgrace and danger;
 but it cannot surely be imagined that accusations of so
 unpromising an appearance were either lightly or frequently
 undertaken by the Pagan subjects of the Roman empire.<small>(<a href="nt16/060.htm">60</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="popu"><small class="ok">Popular clamours</small><br>
 
 The expedient which was employed to elude the prudence of
 the laws affords a sufficient proof how effectually they
 disappointed the mischievous designs of private malice or
 superstitious zeal. In a large and tumultuous assembly the
 restraints of fear and shame, so forcible on the minds of
 individuals, are deprived of the greatest part of their
 influence. The pious Christian, as he was desirous to
 obtain, or to escape, the glory of martyrdom, expected,
 either with impatience or with terror, the stated returns of
 the public games and festivals. On those occasions the
 inhabitants of the great cities of the empire were collected
 in the circus or the theatre, where every circumstance of
 the place, as well as of the ceremony, contributed to kindle
 their devotion and to extinguish their humanity. Whilst the
 numerous spectators, crowned with garlands, perfumed with
 incense, purified with the blood of victims, and surrounded
 with the altars and statues of their tutelar deities,
 resigned themselves to the enjoyment of pleasures which they
 considered as an essential part of their religious worship,
 they recollected that the Christians alone abhorred the gods
 of mankind, and, by their absence and melancholy on these
 solemn festivals, seemed to insult or to lament the public
 felicity. If the empire had been afflicted by any recent
 calamity, by a plague, a famine, or an unsuccessful war; if
 the Tiber had, or if the Nile had not, risen beyond its
 banks; if the earth had shaken, or if the temperate order of
 the seasons had been interrupted, the superstitious Pagans
 were convinced that the crimes and the impiety of the
 Christians, who were spared by the excessive lenity of the
 government, had at length provoked the Divine justice. It
 was not among a licentious and exasperated populace that the
 forms of legal proceedings could be observed; it was not in
 an amphitheatre, stained with the blood of wild beasts and
 gladiators, that the voice of compassion could be heard. The
 impatient clamours of the multitude denounced the Christians
 as the enemies of gods and men, doomed them to the severest
 tortures, and, venturing to accuse by names some of the most
 distinguished of the new sectaries, required with
 irresistible vehemence that they should be instantly
 apprehended and cast to the lions. <small>(<a href="nt16/061.htm">61</a>)</small> The provincial 
 governors and magistrates who presided in the public
 spectacles were usually inclined to gratify the
 inclinations, and to appease the rage of the people, by the
 sacrifice of a few obnoxious victims. But the wisdom of the
 emperors protected the church from the danger of these
 tumultuous clamours and irregular accusations, which they
 justly censured as repugnant both to the firmness and to the
 equity of their administration. The edicts of Hadrian and of
 Antoninus Pius expressly declared that the voice of the
 multitude should never be admitted as legal evidence to
 convict or to punish those unfortunate persons who had
 embraced the enthusiasm of the Christians.<small>(<a href="nt16/062.htm">62</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="tria"><small class="ok">Trials of the Christians.</small><br>
 
  III. Punishment was not the inevitable consequence of
 conviction, and the Christians whose guilt was the most
 clearly proved by the testimony of witnesses, or even by
 their voluntary confession, still retained in their own
 power the alternative of life or death. It was not so much
 the past offence, as the actual resistance, which excited
 the indignation of the magistrate. He was persuaded that he
 offered them an easy pardon, since, if they consented to
 cast a few grains of incense upon the altar, they were
 dismissed from the tribunal in safety and with applause. It
 was esteemed the duty of a humane judge to endeavour to
 reclaim, rather than to punish, those deluded enthusiasts.
 Varying his tone according to the age, the sex, or the
 situation of the prisoners, he frequently condescended to
 set before their eyes every circumstance which could render
 life more pleasing, or death more terrible; and to solicit,
 nay to intreat them, that they would show some compassion to
 themselves, to their families, and to their friends.<small>(<a href="nt16/063.htm">63</a>)</small> If 
 threats and persuasions proved ineffectual, he had often
 recourse to violence; the scourge and the rack were called
 in to supply the deficiency of argument, and every art of
 cruelty was employed to subdue such inflexible, and, as it
 appeared to the Pagans, such criminal obstinacy. The ancient
 apologists of Christianity have censured, with equal truth
 and severity, the irregular conduct of their persecutors,
 who, contrary to every principle of judicial proceeding,
 admitted the use of torture, in order to obtain, not a
 confession, but a denial, of the crime which was the object
 of their inquiry. <small>(<a href="nt16/064.htm">64</a>)</small> The monks of succeeding ages, who, in 
 their peaceful solitudes, entertained themselves with
 diversifying the deaths and sufferings of the primitive
 martyrs, have frequently invented torments of a much more
 refined and ingenious nature. In particular, it has pleased
 them to suppose that the zeal of the Roman magistrates,
 disdaining every consideration of moral virtue or public
 decency, endeavoured to seduce those whom they were unable
 to vanquish, and that by their orders the most brutal
 violence was offered to those whom they found it impossible
 to seduce. It is related that pious females, who were
 prepared to despise death, were sometimes condemned to a
 more severe trial, and called upon to determine whether they
 set a higher value on their religion or on their chastity.
 The youths to whose licentious embraces they were abandoned
 received a solemn exhortation from the judge to exert their
 most strenuous efforts to maintain the honour of Venus
 against the impious virgin who refused to burn incense on
 her altars. Their violence, however, was commonly
 disappointed, and the seasonable interposition of some
 miraculous power preserved the chaste spouses of Christ from
 the dishonour even of an involuntary defeat. We should not
 indeed neglect to remark that the more ancient as well as
 authentic memorials of the church are seldom polluted with
 these extravagant and indecent fictions.<small>(<a href="nt16/065.htm">65</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="huma"><small class="ok">Humanity of Roman magistrates</small><br>
 
 The total disregard of truth and probability in the
 representation of these primitive martyrdoms was occasioned
 by a very natural mistake. The ecclesiastical writers of the
 fourth or fifth centuries ascribed to the magistrates of
 Rome the same degree of implacable and unrelenting zeal
 which filled their own breasts against the heretics or the
 idolaters of their own times. It is not improbable that some
 of those persons who were raised to the dignities of the
 empire might have imbibed the prejudices of the populace,
 and that the cruel disposition of others might occasionally
 be stimulated by motives of avarice or of personal
 resentment.<small>(<a href="nt16/066.htm">66</a>)</small> But it is certain, and we may appeal to the 
 grateful confessions of the first Christians, that the
 greatest part of those magistrates who exercised in the
 provinces the authority of the emperor or of the senate, and
 to whose hands alone the jurisdiction of life and death was
 intrusted, behaved like men of polished manners and liberal
 education, who respected the rules of justice, and who were
 conversant with the precepts of philosophy. They frequently
 declined the odious task of persecution, dismissed the
 charge with contempt, or suggested to the accused Christian
 some legal evasion by which he might elude the severity of
 the laws. <small>(<a href="nt16/067.htm">67</a>)</small> Whenever they were invested with a 
 discretionary power,<small>(<a href="nt16/068.htm">68</a>)</small> they used it much less for the 
 oppression than for the relief and benefit of the afflicted
 church. They were far from condemning all the Christians who
 were accused before their tribunal, and very far from
 punishing with death all those who were convicted of an
 obstinate adherence to the new superstition. Contenting themselves, for the most part, with the milder chastisements of imprisonment, exile, or slavery in the mines,<small>(<a href="nt16/069.htm">69</a>)</small> they left the unhappy victims of their justice some reason to hope that a prosperous event, the accession, the marriage, or the triumph of an emperor, might speedily restore them by a general pardon to their former state. <sup id="inco"><i>Inconsiderable number of martyrs</i></sup> The martyrs, devoted to immediate execution by the Roman magistrates, appear to have been selected from the most opposite extremes. They were either bishops and presbyters, the persons the most distinguished among the Christians by their rank and influence, and whose example might strike terror into the whole sect;<small>(<a href="nt16/070.htm">70</a>)</small> or else they were the meanest and most abject among them, particularly those of the servile condition, whose lives were esteemed of little value, and whose sufferings were viewed by the ancients with too careless an indifference. <small>(<a href="nt16/071.htm">71</a>)</small> The learned Origen, who, from his 
 experience as well as readings, was intimately acquainted with the history of the Christians, declares, in the most express terms, that the number of martyrs was very inconsiderable.<small>(<a href="nt16/072.htm">72</a>)</small> His authority would alone be sufficient 
 to annihilate that formidable army of martyrs, whose relics, drawn for the most part from the catacombs of Rome, have replenished so many churches, <small>(<a href="nt16/073.htm">73</a>)</small> and whose marvellous 
 achievements have been the subject of so many volumes of holy romance.<small>(<a href="nt16/074.htm">74</a>)</small> But the general assertion of Origen may be explained and confirmed by the particular testimony of his friend Dionysius, who, in the immense city of Alexandria,
 and under the rigorous persecution of Decius, reckons only ten men and seven women who suffered for the profession of the Christian name.<small>(<a href="nt16/075.htm">75</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="exam"><small class="ok">Example of Cyprian bishop of Carthage</small><br>
 
 During the same period of persecution, the zealous, the
 eloquent, the ambitious Cyprian governed the church, not
 only of Carthage, but even of Africa. He possessed every
 quality which could engage the reverence of the faithful, or
 provoke the suspicions and resentment of the Pagan
 magistrates. His character as well as his station seemed to
 mark out that holy prelate as the most distinguished object
 of envy and of danger. <small>(<a href="nt16/076.htm">76</a>)</small> The experience, however, of the 
 life of Cyprian is sufficient to prove that our fancy has
 exaggerated the perilous situation of a Christian bishop;
 and that the dangers to which he was exposed were less
 imminent than those which temporal ambition is always
 prepared to encounter in the pursuit of honours. Four Roman
 emperors, with their families, their favourites, and their
 adherents, perished by the sword in the space of ten years,
 during which the bishop of Carthage guided by his authority
 and eloquence the councils of the African church. It was
 only in the third year of his administration that he had
 reason, during a few months, to apprehend the severe edicts
 of Decius, the vigilance of the magistrate, and the clamours
 of the multitude, <sup id="hisd"><i>His danger and flight.</i></sup> who loudly demanded that Cyprian, the
 leader of the Christians, should be thrown to the lions.
 Prudence suggested the necessity of a temporary retreat, and
 the voice of prudence was obeyed. He withdrew himself into
 an obscure solitude, from whence he could maintain a
 constant correspondence with the clergy and people of
 Carthage; and, concealing himself till the tempest was past,
 he preserved his life, without relinquishing either his
 power or his reputation. His extreme caution did not however
 escape the censure of the more rigid Christians, who
 lamented, or the reproaches of his personal enemies, who
 insulted, a conduct which they considered as a pusillanimous
 and criminal desertion of the most sacred duty. <small>(<a href="nt16/077.htm">77</a>)</small> The 
 propriety of reserving himself for the future exigencies of
 the church, the example of several holy bishops,<small>(<a href="nt16/078.htm">78</a>)</small> and the 
 divine admonitions which, as he declares himself, he
 frequently received in visions and ecstacies, were the
 reasons alleged in his justification. <small>(<a href="nt16/079.htm">79</a>)</small> But his best 
 apology may be found in the cheerful resolution with which
 about eight years afterwards, he suffered death in the cause
 of religion. The authentic history of his martyrdom has been
 recorded with unusual candour and impartiality. A short
 abstract therefore of its most important circumstances will
 convey the clearest information of the spirit and of the
 forms of the Roman persecutions.<small>(<a href="nt16/080.htm">80</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="hisb"><small class="ok">A.D. 257. His banishment.</small><br>
 
 When Valerian was consul for the third, and Gallienus for
 the fourth time, Paternus, proconsul of Africa, summoned
 Cyprian to appear in his private council chamber. He there
 acquainted him with the imperial mandate which he had just
 received,<small>(<a href="nt16/081.htm">81</a>)</small> that those who had abandoned the Roman religion 
 should immediately return to the practice of the ceremonies
 of their ancestors. Cyprian replied without hesitation that
 he was a Christian and a bishop, devoted to the worship of
 the true and only Deity, to whom he offered up his daily
 supplications for the safety and prosperity of the two
 emperors, his lawful sovereigns. With modest confidence he
 pleaded the privilege of a citizen in refusing to give any
 answer to some invidious and indeed illegal questions which
 the proconsul had proposed. A sentence of banishment was
 pronounced as the penalty of Cyprian's disobedience; and he
 was conducted without delay to Curubis, a free and maritime
 city of Zeugitana, in a pleasant situation, a fertile
 territory, and at the distance of about forty miles from
 Carthage.<small>(<a href="nt16/082.htm">82</a>)</small> The exiled bishop enjoyed the conveniences of 
 life and the consciousness of virtue. His reputation was
 diffused over Africa and Italy; an account of his behaviour
 was published for the edification of the Christian world;<small>(<a href="nt16/083.htm">83</a>)</small> 
 and his solitude was frequently interrupted by the letters,
 the visits, and the congratulations of the faithful. On the
 arrival of a new proconsul in the province the fortune of
 Cyprian appeared for some time to wear a still more
 favourable aspect. He was recalled from banishment, and,
 though not yet permitted to return to Carthage, his own
 gardens in the neighbourhood of the capital were assigned
 for the place of his residence.<small>(<a href="nt16/084.htm">84</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="hisc"><small class="ok">His condemnation.</small><br>
 
At length, exactly one year <small>(<a href="nt16/085.htm">85</a>)</small> after Cyprian was first 
 apprehended, Galerius Maximus, proconsul of Africa, received
 the imperial warrant for the execution of the Christian
 teachers. The bishop of Carthage was sensible that he should
 be singled out for one of the first victims, and the frailty
 of nature tempted him to withdraw himself, by a secret
 flight, from the danger and the honour of martyrdom; but,
 soon recovering that fortitude which his character required,
 he returned to his gardens, and patiently expected the
 ministers of death. Two officers of rank, who were intrusted
 with that commission, placed Cyprian between them in a
 chariot, and, as the proconsul was not then at leisure, they
 conducted him, not to a prison, but to a private house in
 Carthage, which belonged to one of them. An elegant supper
 was provided for the entertainment of the bishop, and his
 Christian friends were permitted for the last time to enjoy
 his society, whilst the streets were filled with a multitude
 of the faithful, anxious and alarmed at the approaching fate
 of their spiritual father. <small>(<a href="nt16/086.htm">86</a>)</small> In the morning he appeared 
 before the tribunal of the proconsul, who, after informing himself of the name and situation of Cyprian, commanded him to offer sacrifice, and pressed him to reflect on the consequences of his disobedience. The refusal of Cyprian was firm and decisive, and the magistrate, when he had taken the opinion of his council, pronounced, with some reluctance, the sentence of death. It was conceived in the following terms: </p>
<blockquote> "That Thascius Cyprianus should be immediately beheaded, as the enemy of the gods of Rome, and as the chief and ringleader of a criminal association, which he had seduced into an impious resistance against the laws of the most holy emperors Valerian and Gallienus." <em><small>(<a href="nt16/087.htm">87</a>)</small> </em> </blockquote>

<p>The manner of his execution was the mildest and least painful that could
 be inflicted on a person convicted of any capital offence: nor was the use of torture admitted to obtain from the bishop of Carthage either the recantation of his principles or the discovery of his accomplices.
 
</p> <p id="hism"><small class="ok">His martyrdom.</small><br>
 
 As soon as the sentence was proclaimed, a general cry of <em class="on">"We
 will die with him" </em> arose at once among the listening multitude of Christians who waited before the palace gates. The generous effusions of their zeal and affection were neither serviceable to Cyprian nor dangerous to themselves. He was led away under a guard of tribunes and centurions, without resistance and without insult, to the place of his execution, a spacious and level plain near the city, which was already filled with great numbers of spectators. His faithful presbyters and deacons were permitted to accompany
 their holy bishop. They assisted him in laying aside his upper garment, spread linen on the ground to catch the precious relics of his blood, and received his orders to bestow five-and-twenty pieces of gold on the executioner. The martyr then covered his face with his hands, and at one
 blow his head was separated from his body. His corpse remained during some hours exposed to the curiosity of the Gentiles, but in the night it was removed, and transported, in a triumphal procession and with a splendid illumination, to the burial place of the Christians. The funeral of
 Cyprian was. publicly celebrated without receiving any interruption from the Roman magistrates; and those among the faithful who had performed the last offices to his person and his memory were secure from the danger of inquiry or of punishment. It is remarkable that, of so great a multitude of bishops in the province of Africa, Cyprian was the first who was esteemed worthy to obtain the crown of martyrdom.<small>(<a href="nt16/088.htm">88</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="vari"><small class="ok">Various incitements to martyrdom.</small><br>
 
It was in the choice of Cyprian either to die a martyr or to
 live an apostate, but on that choice depended the
 alternative of honour or infamy. Could we suppose that the
 bishop of Carthage had employed the profession of the
 Christian faith only as the instrument of his avarice or
 ambition, it was still incumbent on him to support the
 character which he had assumed,<small>(<a href="nt16/089.htm">89</a>)</small> and, if he possessed the 
 smallest degree of manly fortitude, rather to expose himself
 to the most cruel tortures than by a single act to exchange
 the reputation of a whole life for the abhorrence of his
 Christian brethren and the contempt of the Gentile world.
 But if the zeal of Cyprian was supported by the sincere
 conviction of the truth of those doctrines which he
 preached, the crown of martyrdom must have appeared to him
 as an object of desire rather than of terror. It is not easy
 to extract any distinct ideas from the vague though eloquent
 declamations of the Fathers, or to ascertain the degree of
 immortal glory and happiness which they confidently promised
 to those who were so fortunate as to shed their blood in the
 cause of religion. <small>(<a href="nt16/090.htm">90</a>)</small> They inculcated with becoming 
 diligence that the fire of martyrdom supplied every defect
 and expiated every sin; that, while the souls of ordinary
 Christians were obliged to pass through a slow and painful
 purification, the triumphant sufferers entered into the
 immediate fruition of eternal bliss, where, in the society
 of the patriarchs, the apostles, and the prophets, they
 reigned with Christ, and acted as his assessors in the
 universal judgment of mankind. The assurance of a lasting
 reputation upon earth, a motive so congenial to the vanity
 of human nature, often served to animate the courage of the
 martyrs. The honours which Rome or Athens bestowed on those
 citizens who had fallen in the cause of their country were
 cold and unmeaning demonstrations of respect, when compared
 with the ardent gratitude and devotion which the primitive
 church expressed towards the victorious champions of the
 faith. The annual commemoration of their virtues and
 sufferings was observed as a sacred ceremony, and at length
 terminated in religious worship. Among the Christians who
 had publicly confessed their religious principles, those who
 (as it very frequently happened) had been dismissed from the
 tribunal or the prisons of the Pagan magistrates obtained
 such honours as were justly due to their imperfect martyrdom
 and their generous resolution. The most pious females
 courted the permission of imprinting kisses on the fetters
 which they had worn, and on the wounds which they had
 received. Their persons were esteemed holy, their decisions
 were admitted with deference, and they too often abused, by
 their spiritual pride and licentious manners, the
 pre-eminence which their zeal and intrepidity had acquired.
 <small>(<a href="nt16/091.htm">91</a>)</small> Distinctions like these, whilst they display the exalted 
 merit, betray the inconsiderable number, of those who
 suffered and of those who died for the profession of
 Christianity.
 
</p> <p id="ardo"><small class="ok">Ardour of the first Christians.</small><br>
 
The sober discretion of the present age will more readily
 censure than admire, but can more easily admire than
 imitate, the fervour of the first Christians, who, according
 to the lively expression of Sulpicius Severus, desired
 martyrdom with more eagerness than his own contemporaries
 solicited a bishopric. <small>(<a href="nt16/092.htm">92</a>)</small> The epistles which Ignatius 
 composed as he was carried in chains through the cities of
 Asia breathe sentiments the most repugnant to the ordinary
 feelings of human nature. He earnestly beseeches the Romans
 that, when he should be exposed in the amphitheatre, they
 would not, by their kind but unseasonable intercession,
 deprive him of the crown of glory; and he declares his
 resolution to provoke and irritate the wild beasts which
 might be employed as the instruments of his death.<small>(<a href="nt16/093.htm">93</a>)</small> Some 
 stories are related of the courage of martyrs who actually
 performed what Ignatius had intended, who exasperated the
 fury of the lions, pressed the executioner to hasten his
 office, cheerfully leaped into the fires which were kindled
 to consume them, and discovered a sensation of joy and
 pleasure in the midst of the most exquisite tortures.
 Several examples have been preserved of a zeal impatient of
 those restraints which the emperors had provided for the
 security of the church. The Christians sometimes supplied by
 their voluntary declaration the want of an accuser, rudely
 disturbed the public service of paganism,<small>(<a href="nt16/094.htm">94</a>)</small> and, rushing in 
 crowds round the tribunal of the magistrates, called upon
 them to pronounce and to inflict the sentence of the law.
 The behaviour of the Christians was too remarkable to escape
 the notice of the ancient philosophers, but they seem to
 have considered it with much less admiration than
 astonishment. Incapable of conceiving the motives which
 sometimes transported the fortitude of believers beyond the
 bounds of prudence or reason, they treated such an eagerness
 to die as the strange result of obstinate despair, of stupid
 insensibility, or of superstitious frenzy. <small>(<a href="nt16/095.htm">95</a>)</small></p>
<blockquote> "Unhappy men!" <em>exclaimed the proconsul Antoninus to the Christians of Asia, </em> "unhappy men! it you are thus weary of your lives, is it so difficult for you to find ropes and precipices?" <em><small>(<a href="nt16/096.htm">96</a>)</small></em></blockquote>

<p>He was extremely cautious (as it is observed by a learned and pious historian) of punishing men who had found no accusers but themselves, the imperial laws not having made any provisions for so unexpected a case; condemning therefore a few as a warning to their brethren, he dismissed the
 multitude with indignation and contempt. <small>(<a href="nt16/097.htm">97</a>)</small> Notwithstanding this real or affected disdain, the intrepid constancy of the faithful was productive of more salutary effects on those which nature or grace had disposed for the easy reception of religious truth. On these melancholy occasions there were many among the Gentiles who pitied, who admired, and who were converted. The generous enthusiasm was communicated from the sufferer to the spectators, and the blood of martyrs, according to a well-known observation, became the seed of the church.
 
</p> <p id="grad"><small class="ok">Gradual relaxation.</small><br>
 
 But, although devotion had raised, and eloquence continued to
 inflame, this fever of the mind, it insensibly gave way to
 the more natural hopes and fears of the human heart, to the
 love of life, the apprehension of pain, and the horror of
 dissolution. The more prudent rulers of the church found
 themselves obliged to restrain the indiscreet ardour of
 their followers, and to distrust a constancy which too often
 abandoned them in the hour of trial.<small>(<a href="nt16/098.htm">98</a>)</small> As the lives of the 
 faithful became less mortified and austere, they were every
 day less ambitious of the honours of martyrdom; and the
 soldiers of Christ, instead of distinguishing themselves by
 voluntary deeds of heroism, frequently deserted their post,
 and fled in confusion before the enemy whom it was their
 duty to resist. There were three methods, however, of
 escaping the flames of persecution, which were not attended
 with an equal degree of guilt: the first indeed was
 generally allowed to be innocent; the second was of a
 doubtful, or at least of a venial, nature; but the third
 implied a direct and criminal apostasy from the Christian
 faith.
 
</p> <p id="thre"><small class="ok">Three methods of escaping martyrdom.</small><br>
 
  I. A modern Inquisitor would hear with surprise that,
 whenever an information was given to a Roman magistrate of
 any person within his jurisdiction who had embraced the sect
 of the Christians, the charge was communicated to the party
 accused, and that a convenient time was allowed him to
 settle his domestic concerns, and to prepare an answer to
 the crime which was imputed to him.<small>(<a href="nt16/099.htm">99</a>)</small> If he entertained any 
 doubt of his own constancy, such a delay afforded him the
 opportunity of preserving his life and honour by flight, of
 withdrawing himself into some obscure retirement or some
 distant province, and of patiently expecting the return of
 peace and security. A measure so consonant to reason was
 soon authorised by the advice and example of the most holy
 prelates; and seems to have been censured by few, except by
 the Montanists, who deviated into heresy by their strict and
 obstinate adherence to the rigour of ancient discipline.<small>(<a href="nt16/100.htm">100</a>)</small> 
  II. The provincial governors, whose zeal was less prevalent
 than their avarice, had countenanced the practice of selling
 certificates (or libels as they were called), which attested
 that the persons therein mentioned had complied with the
 laws, and sacrificed to the Roman deities. By producing
 these false declarations, the opulent and timid Christians
 were enabled to silence the malice of an informer, and to
 reconcile in some measure their safety with their religion.
 A slight penance atoned for this profane dissimulation.<small>(<a href="nt16/101.htm">101</a>)</small> 
 III. In every persecution there were great numbers of
 unworthy Christians who publicly disowned or renounced the
 faith which they had professed; and who confirmed the
 sincerity of their abjuration by the legal acts of burning
 incense or of offering sacrifices. Some of these apostates
 had yielded on the first menace or exhortation of the
 magistrate; whilst the patience of others had been subdued
 by the length and repetition of tortures. The affrighted
 countenances of some betrayed their inward remorse, while
 others advanced with confidence and alacrity to the altars
 of the gods. <small>(<a href="nt16/102.htm">102</a>)</small> But the disguise which fear had imposed 
 subsisted no longer than the present danger. As soon as the
 severity of the persecution was abated, the doors of the
 churches were assailed by the returning multitude of
 penitents, who detested their idolatrous submission, and who
 solicited with equal ardour, but with various success, their
 re-admission into the society of Christians.<small>(<a href="nt16/103.htm">103</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="alte"><small class="ok">Alternatives of severity and toleration.</small><br>

IV. Notwithstanding the general rules established for the
 conviction and punishment of the Christians, the fate of
 those sectaries, in an extensive and arbitrary government,
 must still, in a great measure, have depended on their own
 behaviour, the circumstances of the times, and the temper of
 their supreme as well as subordinate rulers. Zeal might
 sometimes provoke, and prudence might sometimes avert or
 assuage, the superstitious fury of the Pagans. A variety of
 motives might dispose the provincial governors either to
 enforce or to relax the execution of the laws; and of these
 motives the most forcible was their regard not only for the
 public edicts, but for the secret intentions of the emperor,
 a glance from whose eye was sufficient to kindle or to
 extinguish the flames of persecution. As often as any
 occasional severities were exercised in the different parts
 of the empire, the primitive Christians lamented and perhaps
 magnified their own sufferings; <sup id="thet"><i>The ten persecutions.</i></sup> but the celebrated number of
 ten persecutions has been determined by the ecclesiastical
 writers of the fifth century, who possessed a more distinct
 view of the prosperous or adverse fortunes of the church
 from the age of Nero to that of Diocletian. The ingenious
 parallels of the ten plagues of Egypt, and of the ten horns
 of the Apocalypse, first suggested this calculation to their
 minds; and in their application of the faith of prophecy to
 the truth of history they were careful to select those
 reigns which were indeed the most hostile to the Christian
 cause.<small>(<a href="nt16/104.htm">104</a>)</small> But these transient persecutions served only to 
 revive the zeal and to restore the discipline of the
 faithful; and the moments of extraordinary rigour were
 compensated by much longer intervals of peace and security.
 The indifference of some princes and the indulgence of
 others permitted the Christians to enjoy, though not perhaps
 a legal, yet an actual and public toleration of their
 religion.
 
</p> <p id="supp"><small class="ok">Supposed edicts of Tiberius and Marcus Antoninus.</small><br>
 
 The Apology of Tertullian contains two very ancient, very
 singular, but at the same time very suspicious instances of
 Imperial clemency; the edicts published by Tiberius and by
 Marcus Antoninus, and designed not only to protect the
 innocence of the Christians, but even to proclaim those
 stupendous miracles which had attested the truth of their
 doctrine. The first of these examples is attended with some
 difficulties which might perplex a sceptical mind.<small>(<a href="nt16/105.htm">105</a>)</small> We 
 are required to believe that Pontius Pilate informed the
 emperor of the unjust sentence of death which he had
 pronounced against an innocent, and, as it appeared, a
 divine person; and that, without acquiring the merit, he
 exposed himself to the danger, of martyrdom; that Tiberius,
 who avowed his contempt for all religion, immediately
 conceived the design of placing the Jewish Messiah among the
 gods of Rome; <I>that</I> his servile senate ventured to disobey
 the commands of their master; <I>that</I> Tiberius, instead of
 resenting their refusal, contented himself with protecting
 the Christians from the severity of the laws, many years
 before such laws were enacted or before the church had
 assumed any distinct name or existence; and lastly, that the
 memory of this extraordinary transaction was preserved in
 the most public and authentic records, which escaped the
 knowledge of the historians of Greece and Rome, and were
 only visible to the eyes of an African Christian, who
 composed his Apology one hundred and sixty years after the
 death of Tiberius. The edict of Marcus Antoninus is supposed
 to have been the effect of his devotion and gratitude for
 the miraculous deliverance which he had obtained in the
 Marcomannic war. The distress of the legions, the seasonable
 tempest of rain and hail, of thunder and lightning, and the
 dismay and defeat of the barbarians, have been celebrated by
 the eloquence of several Pagan writers. If there were any
 Christians in that army, it was natural that they should
 ascribe some merit to the fervent prayers which, in the
 moment of danger, they had offered up for their own and the
 public safety. But we are still assured by monuments of
 brass and marble, by the Imperial medals, and by the
 Antonine column, that neither the prince nor the people
 entertained any sense of this signal obligation, since they
 unanimously attribute their deliverance to the providence of
 Jupiter, and to the interposition of Mercury. During the
 whole course of his reign Marcus despised the Christians as
 a philosopher, and punished them as a sovereign.<small>(<a href="nt16/106.htm">106</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="stat"><small class="ok">State of the Christians in the reigns of Commodus and Severus. A.D. 180..</small><br>
 
 By a singular fatality, the hardships which they had endured
 under the government of a virtuous prince immediately ceased
 on the accession of a tyrant; and as none except themselves
 had experienced the injustice of Marcus, so they alone were
 protected by the lenity of Commodus. The celebrated Marcia,
 the most favoured of his concubines, and who at length
 contrived the murder of her Imperial lover, entertained a
 singular affection for the oppressed church; and though it
 was impossible that she could reconcile the practice of vice
 with the precepts of the Gospel, she might hope to atone for
 the frailties of her sex and profession by declaring herself
 the patroness of the Christians. <small>(<a href="nt16/107.htm">107</a>)</small> Under the gracious 
 protection of Marcia they passed in safety the thirteen
 years of a cruel tyranny; and when the empire was
 established in the house of Severus, they formed a domestic,
 but more honourable connection with the new court. The
 emperor was persuaded that, in a dangerous sickness, he had
 derived some benefit, either spiritual or physical, from the
 holy oil with which one of his slaves had anointed him. He
 always treated with peculiar distinction several persons of
 both sexes who had embraced the new religion. The nurse as
 well as the preceptor of Caracalla were Christians; and if
 that young prince ever betrayed a sentiment of humanity, it
 was occasioned by an incident which, however trifling, bore
 some relation to the cause of Christianity.<small>(<a href="nt16/108.htm">108</a>)</small> Under the 
 reign of Severus the fury of the populace was checked; the
 rigour of ancient laws was for some time suspended; and the
 provincial governors were satisfied with receiving an annual
 present from the churches within their jurisdiction, as the
 price, or as the reward, of their moderation. <small>(<a href="nt16/109.htm">109</a>)</small> The 
 controversy concerning the precise time of the celebration
 of Easter armed the bishops of Asia and Italy against each
 other, and was considered as the most important business of
 this period of leisure and tranquillity. <small>(<a href="nt16/110.htm">110</a>)</small> Nor was the 
 peace of the church interrupted till the increasing numbers
 of proselytes seem at length to have attracted the
 attention, and to have alienated the mind, of Severus. With
 the design of restraining the progress of Christianity, he
 published an edict, which, though it was designed to affect
 only the new converts, could not be carried into strict
 execution without exposing to danger and punishment the most
 zealous of their teachers and missionaries. In this
 mitigated persecution we may still discover the indulgent
 spirit of Rome and of the Polytheism, which so readily
 admitted every excuse in favour of those who practised the
 religious ceremonies of their fathers.<small>(<a href="nt16/111.htm">111</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="ofth"><small class="ok">Of the succession of Severus.A.D. 211-249</small><br>
 
 But the laws which Severus had enacted soon expired with the
 authority of that emperor; and the Christians, after this
 accidental tempest, enjoyed a calm of thirty-eight years.
 <small>(<a href="nt16/112.htm">112</a>)</small> Till this period they had usually held their assemblies 
 in private houses and sequestered places. They were now
 permitted to erect and consecrate convenient edifices for
 the purpose of religious worship ;<small>(<a href="nt16/113.htm">113</a>)</small> to purchase lands, 
 even at Rome itself, for the use of the community; and to
 conduct the elections of their ecclesiastical ministers in
 so public, but at the same time in so exemplary a manner, as
 to deserve the respectful attention of the Gentiles.<small>(<a href="nt16/114.htm">114</a>)</small> 
 This long repose of the church was accompanied with dignity.
 The reigns of those princes who derived their extraction
 from the Asiatic provinces proved the most favourable to the
 Christians; the eminent persons of the sect, instead of
 being reduced to implore the protection of a slave or
 concubine, were admitted into the palace in the honourable
 characters of priests and philosophers; and their mysterious
 doctrines, which were already diffused among the people,
 insensibly attracted the curiosity of their sovereign. When
 the empress Mamaea passed through Antioch, she expressed a
 desire of conversing with the celebrated Origen, the fame of
 whose piety and learning was spread over the East. Origen
 obeyed so flattering an invitation, and, though he could not
 expect to succeed in the conversion of an artful and
 ambitious woman, she listened with pleasure to his eloquent
 exhortations, and honourably dismissed him to his retirement
 in Palestine.<small>(<a href="nt16/115.htm">115</a>)</small> The sentiments of Mamaea were adopted by 
 her son Alexander, and the philosophic devotion of that
 emperor was marked by a singular but injudicious regard for
 the Christian religion. In his domestic chapel he placed the
 statues of Abraham, of Orpheus, of Apollonius, and of
 Christ, as an honour justly due to those respectable sages
 who had instructed mankind in the various modes of
 addressing their homage to the supreme and universal Deity.
 <small>(<a href="nt16/116.htm">116</a>)</small> A purer faith, as well as worship, was openly professed 
 and practised among his household. Bishops, perhaps for the
 first time, were seen at court; and, after the death of
 Alexander, when the inhuman Maximin discharged his fury on
 the favourites and servants of his unfortunate benefactor, a
 great number of Christians, of every rank, and of both
 sexes, were involved in the promiscuous massacre, which, on
 their account, has improperly received the name of
 Persecution.<small>(<a href="nt16/117.htm">117</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="ofma"><small class="ok">Of Maximin, Philip and Decius.</small><br>
 
 Notwithstanding the cruel disposition of Maximin, the
 effects of his resentment against the Christians were of a
 very local and temporary nature, and the pious Origen, who
 had been proscribed as a devoted victim, was still reserved
 to convey the truths of the Gospel to the ear of monarchs.
 <small>(<a href="nt16/118.htm">118</a>)</small> He addressed several edifying letters to the emperor 
 Philip, to his wife, and to his mother, and as soon as that
 prince, who was born in the neighbourhood of Palestine, had
 usurped the Imperial sceptre, the Christians acquired a
 friend and a protector. The public and even partial favour
 of Philip towards the sectaries of the new religion, and his
 constant reverence for the ministers of the church, gave
 some colour to the suspicion, which prevailed in his own
 times, that the emperor himself was become a convert to the
 faith;<small>(<a href="nt16/119.htm">119</a>)</small> and afforded some grounds for a fable which was 
 afterwards invented, that he had been purified by confession
 and penance from the guilt contracted by the murder of his
 innocent predecessor.<small>(<a href="nt16/120.htm">120</a>)</small> The fall of Philip introduced, 
 with the change of masters, a new system of government, so
 oppressive to the Christians, that their former condition,
 ever since the time of Domitian, was represented as a state
 of perfect freedom and security, if compared with the
 rigorous treatment which they experienced under the short
 reign of Decius. <small>(<a href="nt16/121.htm">121</a>)</small> The virtues of that prince will 
 scarcely allow us to suspect that he was actuated by a mean
 resentment against the favourites of his predecessor; and it
 is more reasonable to believe that, in the prosecution of
 his general design to restore the purity of Roman manners,
 he was desirous of delivering the empire from what he
 condemned as a recent and criminal superstition. The bishops
 of the most considerable cities were removed by exile or
 death: the vigilance of the magistrates prevented the clergy
 of Rome during sixteen months from proceeding to a new
 election; and it was the opinion of the Christians that the
 emperor would more patiently endure a competitor for the
 purple than a bishop in the capital.<small>(<a href="nt16/122.htm">122</a>)</small> Were it possible to 
 suppose that the penetration of Decius had discovered pride
 under the disguise of humility, or that he could foresee the
 temporal dominion which might insensibly arise from the
 claims of spiritual authority, we might be less surprised
 that he should consider the successors of St. Peter as the
 most formidable rivals to those of Augustus.
 
</p> <p id="ofva"><small class="ok">Of Valerian, Gallienus, and his successors. A.D. 253-260..</small><br>
 
 The administration of Valerian was distinguished by a levity
 and inconstancy ill suited to the gravity of the Roman
 Censor. In the first part of his reign he surpassed in
 clemency those princes who had been suspected of an
 attachment to the Christian faith. In the last three years
 and a half, listening to the insinuations of a minister
 addicted to the superstitions of Egypt, he adopted the
 maxims, and imitated the severity, of his predecessor
 Decius.<small>(<a href="nt16/123.htm">123</a>)</small> The accession of Gallienus, which increased the 
 calamities of the empire, restored peace to the church; and
 the Christians obtained the free exercise of their religion

 terms as seemed to acknowledge their office and public
 character.<small>(<a href="nt16/124.htm">124</a>)</small> The ancient laws, without being formally 
 repealed, were suffered to sink into oblivion; and
 (excepting only some hostile intentions which are attributed
 to the emperor Aurelian<small>(<a href="nt16/125.htm">125</a>)</small> ) the disciples of Christ passed 
 above forty years in a state of prosperity, far more
 dangerous to their virtue than the severest trials of
 persecution.
 
</p> <p id="paul"><small class="ok">Paul of Samosata, his manners. A.D. 260.</small><br>
 
 The story of Paul of Samosata, who filled the metropolitan
 see of Antioch while the East was in the hands of Odenathus
 and Zenobia, may serve to illustrate the condition and
 character of the times. The wealth of that prelate was a
 sufficient evidence of his guilt, since it was neither
 derived from the inheritance of his fathers, nor acquired by
 the arts of honest industry. But Paul considered the service
 of the church as a very lucrative profession. <small>(<a href="nt16/126.htm">126</a>)</small> His 
 ecclesiastical jurisdiction was venal and rapacious; he
 extorted frequent contributions from the most opulent of the
 faithful, and converted to his own use a considerable part
 of the public revenue. By his pride and luxury the Christian
 religion was rendered odious in the eyes of the Gentiles.
 His council chamber and his throne, the splendour with which
 he appeared in public, the suppliant crowd who solicited his
 attention, the multitude of letters and petitions to which
 he dictated his answers, and the perpetual hurry of business
 in which he was involved, were circumstances much better
 suited to the state of a civil magistrate<small>(<a href="nt16/127.htm">127</a>)</small> than to the 
 humility of a primitive bishop. When he harangued his people
 from the pulpit, Paul affected the figurative style and the
 theatrical gestures of an Asiatic sophist, while the
 cathedral resounded with the loudest and most extravagant
 acclamations in the praise of his divine eloquence. Against
 those who resisted his power, or refused to flatter his
 vanity, the prelate of Antioch was arrogant, rigid, and
 inexorable; but he relaxed the discipline, and lavished the
 treasures of the church on his dependent clergy, who were
 permitted to imitate their master in the gratification of
 every sensual appetite. For Paul indulged himself very
 freely in the pleasures of the table, and he had received
 into the episcopal palace two young and beautiful women, as
 the constant companions of his leisure moments.<small>(<a href="nt16/128.htm">128</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="heisd"><small class="ok">He is degraded from the see of Antioch. A.D. 270.</small><br>
 
 Notwithstanding these scandalous vices, if Paul of Samosata
 had preserved the purity of the orthodox faith, his reign
 over the capital of Syria would have ended only with his
 life; and had a reasonable persecution intervened, an effort
 of court might perhaps have placed him in the rank of saints
 and martyrs. Some nice and subtle errors, which he
 imprudently adopted and obstinately maintained, concerning
 the doctrine of the Trinity, excited the zeal and
 indignation of the Eastern churches.<small>(<a href="nt16/129.htm">129</a>)</small> From Egypt to the 
 Euxine Sea, the bishops were in arms and in motion. Several
 councils were held, confutations were published,
 ex-communications were pronounced, ambiguous explanations
 were by turns accepted and refused, treaties were concluded
 and violated, and at length Paul of Samosata was degraded
 from his episcopal character by the sentence of seventy or
 eighty bishops who assembled for that purpose at Antioch,
 and who, without consulting the rights of the clergy or
 people, appointed a successor by their own authority. The
 manifest irregularity of this proceeding increased the
 numbers of the discontented faction; and as Paul, who was no
 stranger to the arts of courts, had insinuated himself into
 the favour of Zenobia, he maintained above four years the
 possession of the episcopal house and office. The victory of
 Aurelian changed the face of the East, and the two
 contending parties, who applied to each other the epithets
 of schism and heresy, were either commanded or permitted to
 plead their cause before the tribunal of the conqueror. This
 public and very singular trial affords a convincing proof
 that the existence, the property, the privileges, and the
 internal policy of the Christians, were acknowledged, if not by the laws, at least by the magistrates of the empire. As a Pagan and as a soldier, it could scarcely be expected that Aurelian should enter into the discussion, whether the sentiments of Paul or those of his adversaries were most agreeable to the true standard of the orthodox faith. His determination, however, was founded on the general principles of equity and reason. <sup id="thes"><i>The sentence is executed by Aurelian. A.D. 274.</i></sup> He considered the bishops of Italy as the most impartial and respectable judges among the Christians, and, as soon as he was informed that they had unanimously approved the sentence of the council, he acquiesced in their opinion, and immediately gave orders that Paul should be compelled to relinquish the temporal possessions belonging to an office, of which, in the judgment of his brethren, he had been regularly deprived. But while we applaud the justice, we should not overlook the policy of Aurelian, who was desirous of restoring and cementing the dependence of the provinces of the capital, by every means which could bind the interest or prejudices of any part of his subjects.<small>(<a href="nt16/130.htm">130</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="peace"><small class="ok">Peace and prosperity of the church under Diocletian.A.D. 284-303</small><br>
 
 Amidst the frequent revolutions of the empire the Christians still flourished in peace and prosperity; and notwithstanding a celebrated era of martyrs has been deduced from the accession of Diocletian, <small>(<a href="nt16/131.htm">131</a>)</small> the new system of policy, introduced and maintained by the wisdom of that prince, continued, during more than eighteen years, to breathe the mildest and most liberal spirit of religious toleration. The mind of Diocletian himself was less adapted indeed to speculative inquiries than to the active labours of war and government. His prudence rendered him averse to any great innovation, and, though his temper was not very susceptible of zeal or enthusiasm, he always maintained an habitual regard for the ancient deities of the empire. But the leisure of the two empresses, of his wife Prisca, and of Valeria his daughter, permitted them to listen with more attention and respect to the truths of Christianity, which in every age has acknowledged its important obligations to female devotion.<small>(<a href="nt16/132.htm">132</a>)</small> The principal eunuchs, Lucian<small>(<a href="nt16/133.htm">133</a>)</small> and 
 Dorotheus, Gorgonius and Andrew, who attended the person, possessed the favour, and governed the household of Diocletian, protected by their powerful influence the faith
 which they had embraced. Their example was imitated by many
 of the most considerable officers of the palace, who, in
 their respective stations, had the care of the Imperial
 ornaments, of the robes, of the furniture, of the jewels,
 and even of the private treasury; and, though it might
 sometimes be incumbent on them to accompany the emperor when
 he sacrificed in the temple, <small>(<a href="nt16/134.htm">134</a>)</small> they enjoyed, with their 
 wives, their children, and their slaves, the free exercise
 of the Christian religion. Diocletian and his colleagues
 frequently conferred the most important offices on those
 persons who avowed their abhorrence for the worship of the
 gods, but who had displayed abilities proper for the service
 of the state. The bishops held an honourable rank in their respective
 provinces, and were treated with distinction and respect,
 not only by the people, but by the magistrates themselves.
 Almost in every city the ancient churches were found
 insufficient to contain the increasing multitude of
 proselytes; and in their place more stately and capacious
 edifices were erected for the public worship of the
 faithful. The corruption of manners and principles, so
 forcibly lamented by Eusebius, <small>(<a href="nt16/135.htm">135</a>)</small> may be considered, not 
 only as a consequence, but as a proof, of the liberty which
 the Christians enjoyed and abused under the reign of
 Diocletian. Prosperity had relaxed the nerves of discipline.
 Fraud, envy, and malice prevailed in every congregation. The
 presbyters aspired to the episcopal office, which every day
 became an object more worthy of their ambition. The bishops,
 who contended with each other for ecclesiastical
 pre-eminence, appeared by their conduct to claim a secular
 and tyrannical power in the church; and the lively faith
 which still distinguished the Christians from the Gentiles
 was shown much less in their lives than in their
 controversial writings.
 
</p> <p id="prog"><small class="ok">Progress of zeal and superstition among the Pagans.</small><br>
 
Notwithstanding this seeming security, an attentive observer might discern some symptoms that threatened the church with a more violent persecution than any which she had yet endured. The zeal and rapid progress of the Christians
 awakened the Polytheists from their supine indifference in the cause of those deities whom custom and education had taught them to revere. The mutual provocations of a religious war, which had already continued above two hundred years, exasperated the animosity of the contending parties. The Pagans were incensed at the rashness of a recent and obscure sect, which presumed to accuse their countrymen of error, and to devote their ancestors to eternal misery. The habits of justifying the popular mythology against the
 invectives of an implacable enemy, produced in their minds some sentiments of faith and reverence for a system which they had been accustomed to consider with the most careless levity. The supernatural powers assumed by the church inspired at the same time terror and emulation. The followers of the established religion intrenched themselves behind a similar fortification of prodigies; invented new modes of sacrifice, of expiation, and of initiation;<small>(<a href="nt16/136.htm">136</a>)</small> attempted to revive the credit of their expiring oracles; <small>(<a href="nt16/137.htm">137</a>)</small> and listened with eager credulity to every imposter who  flattered their prejudices by a tale of wonders.<small>(<a href="nt16/138.htm">138</a>)</small> Both parties seemed to acknowledge the truth of those miracles which were claimed by their adversaries; and while they were contented with ascribing them to the arts of magic, and to the power of daemons, they mutually concurred in restoring
 and establishing the reign of superstition.<small>(<a href="nt16/139.htm">139</a>)</small> Philosophy, her most dangerous enemy, was now converted into her most useful ally. The groves of the Academy, the gardens of Epicurus, and even the portico of the Stoics, were almost
 deserted, as so many different schools of scepticism or impiety;<small>(<a href="nt16/140.htm">140</a>)</small> and many among the Romans were desirous that the writings of Cicero should be condemned and suppressed by
 the authority of the senate.<small>(<a href="nt16/141.htm">141</a>)</small> The prevailing sect of the new Platonicians judged it prudent to connect themselves with the priests, whom perhaps they despised, against the
 Christians, whom they had reason to fear. These fashionable philosophers prosecuted the design of extracting allegorical wisdom from the fictions of the Greek poets; instituted mysterious rites of devotion for the use of their chosen disciples; recommended the worship of the ancient gods as the emblems or ministers of the Supreme Deity, and composed against the faith of the Gospel many elaborate treatises, <small>(<a href="nt16/142.htm">142</a>)</small> which have since been committed to the flames by the prudence of orthodox emperors.<small>(<a href="nt16/143.htm">143</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="maxi"><small class="ok">Maximian and Galerius punish a few Christian soldiers. </small><br>
 
 Although the policy of Diocletian and the humanity of
 Constantius inclined them to preserve inviolate the maxims
 of toleration, it was soon discovered that their two
 associates, Maximian and Galerius, entertained the most
 implacable aversion for the name and religion of the
 Christians. The minds of those princes had never been
 enlightened by science education had never softened their
 temper. They owed their greatness to their swords, and in
 their most elevated fortune they still retained their
 superstitious prejudices of soldiers and peasants. In the
 general administration of the provinces they obeyed the laws
 which their benefactor had established; but they frequently
 found occasions of exercising within their camp and palaces
 a secret persecution, <small>(<a href="nt16/144.htm">144</a>)</small> for which the imprudent zeal of 
 the Christians sometimes offered the most specious
 pretences. A sentence of death was executed upon
 Maximilianus, an African youth, who had been produced by his
 own father before the magistrate as a sufficient and legal
 recruit, but who obstinately persisted in declaring that his
 conscience would not permit him to embrace the profession of
 a soldier.<small>(<a href="nt16/145.htm">145</a>)</small> It could scarcely be expected that any 
 government should suffer the action of Marcellus the
 centurion to pass with impunity. On the day of a public
 festival, that officer threw away his belt, his arms, and
 the ensigns of his office, and exclaimed with a loud voice
 that he would obey none but Jesus Christ the eternal King,
 and that he renounced for ever the use of carnal weapons,
 and the service of an idolatrous master. The soldiers, as
 soon as they recovered from their astonishment, secured the
 person of Marcellus. He was examined in the city of Tingi by
 the president of that part of Mauritania; and as he was
 convicted by his own confession, he was condemned and
 beheaded for the crime of desertion.<small>(<a href="nt16/146.htm">146</a>)</small> Examples of such a 
 nature savour much less of religious persecution than of
 martial or even civil law: but they served to alienate the
 mind of the emperors, to justify the severity of Galerius,
 who dismissed a great number of Christian officers from
 their employments and to authorise the opinion that a sect
 of enthusiasts, which avowed principles so repugnant to the
 public safety, must either remain useless, or would soon
 become dangerous subjects of the empire.
 
</p> <p id="gale"><small class="ok">Galerius prevails on Diocletian to begin a general persecution. </small><br>
 
 After the success of the Persian war had raised the hopes
 and the reputation of Galerius, he passed a winter with
 Diocletian in the palace of Nicomedia; and the fate of
 Christianity became the object of their secret
 consultations. <small>(<a href="nt16/147.htm">147</a>)</small> The experienced emperor was still 
 inclined to pursue measures of lenity and though he readily
 consented to exclude the Christians from holding any
 employments in the household or the army, he urged in the
 strongest terms the danger as well as cruelty of shedding
 the blood of those deluded fanatics. Galerius at length
 extorted from him the permission of summoning a council,
 composed of a few persons the most distinguished in the
 civil and military departments of the state. The important
 question was agitated in their presence, and those ambitious
 courtiers easily discerned that it was incumbent on them to
 second, by their own eloquence, the importunate violence of
 the Caesar. It may be presumed that they insisted on every
 topic which might interest the pride, the piety, or the
 fears, of their sovereign in the destruction of
 Christianity. Perhaps they represented that the glorious
 work of the deliverance of the empire was left imperfect, as
 long as an independent people was permitted to subsist and
 multiply in the heart of the provinces. The Christians (it
 might speciously be alleged), renouncing the gods and the
 institutions of Rome, had constituted a distinct republic,
 which might yet be suppressed before it had acquired any
 military force; but which was already governed by its own
 laws and magistrates, was possessed of a public treasure,
 and was intimately connected in all its parts by the
 frequent assemblies of the bishops, to whose decrees their
 numerous and opulent congregations yielded an implicit
 obedience. Arguments like these may seem to have determined
 the reluctant mind of Diocletian to embrace a new system of
 persecution: but though we may suspect, it is not in our
 power to relate, the secret intrigues of the palace, the
 private views and resentments, the jealousy of women or
 eunuchs, and all those trifling but decisive causes which so
 often influence the fate of empires and the councils of the
 wisest monarchs.<small>(<a href="nt16/148.htm">148</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="demo"><small class="ok">Demolition of the church of Nicomedia. A.D. 303. 23rd Feb.</small><br>
 
 The pleasure of the emperors was at length signified to the
 Christians, who, during the course of this melancholy
 winter, had expected, with anxiety, the result of so many
 secret consultations. The twenty-third of February, which
 coincided with the Roman festival of the Terminalia,<small>(<a href="nt16/149.htm">149</a>)</small> was 
 appointed (whether from accident or design) to set bounds to
 the progress of Christianity. At the earliest dawn of day
 the Praetorian praefect, <small>(<a href="nt16/150.htm">150</a>)</small> accompanied by several generals, tribunes, and officers of the revenue, repaired to the principal church of Nicomedia, which was situated on an
 eminence in the most populous and beautiful part of the
 city. The doors were instantly broken open they rushed into
 the sanctuary and as they searched in vain for some visible
 object of worship, they were obliged to content themselves
 with committing to the flames the volumes of Holy Scripture.
 The ministers of Diocletian were followed by a numerous body
 of guards and pioneers, who marched in order of battle, and
 were provided with all the instruments used in the
 destruction of fortified cities. By their incessant labour,
 a sacred edifice, which towered above the Imperial palace,
 and had long excited the indignation and envy of the
 Gentiles, was in a few hours levelled with the ground.<small>(<a href="nt16/151.htm">151</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="thefi"><small class="ok">The first edict against the Christians. 24th Feb. </small><br>
 
 The next day the general edict of persecution was published;
 <small>(<a href="nt16/152.htm">152</a>)</small> and though Diocletian, still averse to the effusion of 
 blood, had moderated the fury of Galerius, who proposed that
 every one refusing to offer sacrifice should immediately be
 burnt alive, the penalties inflicted on the obstinacy of the
 Christians might be deemed sufficiently rigorous and
 effectual. It was enacted that their churches, in all the
 provinces of the empire, should be demolished to their
 foundations; and the punishment of death was denounced
 against all who should presume to hold any secret assemblies
 for the purpose of religious worship. The philosophers, who
 now assumed the unworthy office of directing the blind zeal
 of persecution, had diligently studied the nature and genius
 of the Christian religion; and as they were not ignorant
 that the speculative doctrines of the faith were supposed to
 be contained in the writings of the prophets, of the
 evangelists, and of the apostles, they most probably
 suggested the order that the bishops and presbyters should
 deliver all their sacred books into the hands of the
 magistrates; who were commanded, under the severest
 penalties, to burn them in a public and solemn manner. By
 the same edict, the property of the church was at once
 confiscated; and the several parts of which it might consist
 were either sold to the highest bidder, united to the
 Imperial domain, bestowed on the cities and corporations, or
 granted to the solicitations of rapacious courtiers. After
 taking such effectual measures to abolish the worship and to
 dissolve the government of the Christians, it was thought
 necessary to subject to the most intolerable hardships the
 condition of those perverse individuals who should still
 reject the religion of nature, of Rome, and of their
 ancestors. Persons of a liberal birth were declared
 incapable of holding any honours or employments; slaves were
 for ever deprived of the hopes of freedom; and the whole
 body of the people were put out of the protection of the
 law. The judges were authorised to hear and to determine
 every action that was brought against Christian. But the
 Christians were not permitted to complain of any injury
 which they themselves had suffered; and thus those
 unfortunate sectaries were exposed to the severity, while
 they were excluded from the benefits, of public justice.
 This new species of martyrdom, so painful and lingering, so
 obscure and ignominious, was, perhaps, the most proper to
 weary the constancy of the faithful: nor can it be doubted
 that the passions and interest of mankind were disposed on
 this occasion to second the designs of the emperors. But the
 policy of a well-ordered government must sometimes have
 interposed in behalf of the oppressed Christians; nor was it
 possible for the Roman princes entirely to remove the
 apprehension of punishment, or to connive at every act of
 fraud and violence, without exposing their own authority and
 the rest of their subjects to the most alarming dangers.<small>(<a href="nt16/153.htm">153</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="zeala"><small class="ok">Zeal and punishment of a Christian. </small><br>
 
 This edict was scarcely exhibited to the public view, in the
 most conspicuous place of Nicomedia, before it was torn down
 by the hands of a Christian, who expressed at the same time,
 by the bitterest invectives, his contempt as well as
 abhorrence for such impious and tyrannical governors. His
 offence, according to the mildest laws, amounted to treason,
 and deserved death. And if it be true that he was a person
 of rank and education, those circumstances could serve only
 to aggravate his guilt. He was burnt, or rather roasted, by
 a slow fire; and his executioners, zealous to revenge the
 personal insult which had been offered to the emperors,
 exhausted every refinement of cruelty, without being able to
 subdue his patience, or to alter the steady and insulting
 smile which, in his dying agonies, he still preserved in his
 countenance. The Christians, though they confessed that his
 conduct had not been strictly conformable to the laws of
 prudence, admired the divine fervour of his zeal; and the
 excessive commendations which they lavished on the memory of
 their hero and martyr contributed to fix a deep impression
 of terror and hatred in the mind of Diocletian.<small>(<a href="nt16/154.htm">154</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="fireo"><small class="ok">Fire of the palace of Nicomedia imputed to the Christians.. </small><br>
 
 His fears were soon alarmed by the view of a danger from
 which he very narrowly escaped. Within fifteen days the
 palace of Nicomedia, and even the bedchamber of Diocletian,
 were twice in flames; and though both times they were
 extinguished without any material damage, the singular
 repetition of the fire was justly considered as an evident
 proof that it had not been the effect of chance or
 negligence. The suspicion naturally fell on the Christians;
 and it was suggested, with some degree of probability, that
 those desperate fanatics, provoked by their present
 sufferings, and apprehensive of impending calamities, had
 entered into a conspiracy with their faithful brethren, the
 eunuchs of the palace, against the lives of two emperors
 whom they detested as the irreconcilable enemies of the
 church of God. Jealousy and resentment prevailed in every
 breast, but especially in that of Diocletian. A great number
 of persons, distinguished either by the offices which they
 had filled or by the favour which they had enjoyed, were
 thrown into prison. Every mode of torture was put in
 practice, and the court, as well as city, was polluted with
 many bloody executions. <small>(<a href="nt16/155.htm">155</a>)</small> But as it was found impossible 
 to extort any discovery of this mysterious transaction, it
 seems incumbent on us either to presume the innocence, or to
 admire the resolution, of the sufferers. A few days
 afterwards Galerius hastily withdrew himself from Nicomedia,
 declaring that, if he delayed his departure from that
 devoted palace, he should fall a sacrifice to the rage of
 the Christians. The ecclesiastical historians, from whom
 alone we derive a partial and imperfect knowledge of this
 persecution, are at a loss how to account for the fears and
 danger of the emperors. Two of these writers, a prince and a
 rhetorician, were eyewitnesses of the fire of Nicomedia. The
 one ascribes it to lightning and the divine wrath, the other
 affirms that it was kindled by the malice of Galerius
 himself.<small>(<a href="nt16/156.htm">156</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="execu"><small class="ok">Execution of the first edict. </small><br>
 
 As the edict against the Christians was designed for a
 general law of the whole empire, and as Diocletian and
 Galerius, though they might not wait for the consent, were
 assured of the concurrence, of the Western princes, it would
 appear more consonant to our ideas of policy that the
 governors of all the provinces should have received secret
 instructions to publish, on one and the same day, this
 declaration of war within their respective departments. It
 was at least to be expected that the convenience of the
 public highways and established posts would have enabled the
 emperors to transmit their orders with the utmost despatch
 from the palace of Nicomedia to the extremities of the Roman
 world; and that they would not have suffered fifty days to
 elapse before the edict was published in Syria, and near
 four months before it was signified to the cities of Africa.
 <small>(<a href="nt16/157.htm">157</a>)</small> This delay may perhaps be imputed to the cautious temper 
 of Diocletian, who had yielded a reluctant consent to the
 measures of persecution, and who was desirous of trying the
 experiment under his more immediate eye before he gave way
 to the disorders and discontent which it must inevitably
 occasion in the distant provinces. At first, indeed, the
 magistrates were restrained from the effusion of blood; but
 the use of every other severity was permitted, and even
 recommended to their zeal; nor could the Christians, though
 they cheerfully resigned the ornaments of their churches,
 resolve to interrupt their religious assemblies, or to
 deliver their sacred books to the flames. The pious
 obstinacy of Felix, an African bishop, appears to have
 embarrassed the subordinate ministers of the government The
 curator of his city sent him in chains to the proconsul. The
 proconsul transmitted him to the Praetorian praefect of
 Italy; and Felix, who disdained even to give an evasive
 answer, was at length beheaded at Venusia, in Lucania, a
 place on which the birth of Horace has conferred fame.<small>(<a href="nt16/158.htm">158</a>)</small> 
 This precedent, and perhaps some Imperial rescript, which
 was issued in consequence of it, appeared to authorise the
 governors of provinces in punishing with death the refusal
 of the Christians to deliver up their sacred books. There
 were undoubtedly many persons who embraced this opportunity
 of obtaining the crown of martyrdom, but there were likewise
 too many who purchased an ignominious life by discovering
 and betraying the Holy Scripture into the hands of infidels.
 A great number even of bishops and presbyters acquired, by
 this criminal compliance, the opprobrious epithet of
 Traitors; and their offence was productive of much present
 scandal and of much future discord in the African church.
 <small>(<a href="nt16/159.htm">159</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="demol"><small class="ok">Demolition of the churches. </small><br>
 
The copies, as well as the versions, of Scripture were already
 so multiplied in the empire, that the most severe
 inquisition could no longer be attended with any fatal
 consequences; and even the sacrifice of those volumes which,
 in every congregation, were preserved for public use,
 required the consent of some treacherous and unworthy
 Christians. But the ruin of the churches was easily effected
 by the authority of the government and by the labour of the
 Pagans. In some provinces, however, the magistrates
 contented themselves with shutting up the places of
 religious worship. In others they more literally complied
 with the terms of the edict; and, after taking away the
 doors, the benches, and the pulpit, which they burnt as it
 were in a funeral pile, they completely demolished the
 remainder of the edifice. <small>(<a href="nt16/160.htm">160</a>)</small> It is perhaps to this 
 melancholy occasion that we should apply a very remarkable
 story, which is related with so many circumstances of
 variety and improbability that it serves rather to excite
 than to satisfy our curiosity. In a small town in Phrygia,
 of whose name as well as situation we are left ignorant, it
 should seem that the magistrates and the body of the people
 had embraced the Christian faith; and as some resistance
 might be apprehended to the execution of the edict, the
 governor of the province was supported by a numerous
 detachment of legionaries. On their approach the citizens
 threw themselves into the church with the resolution either
 of defending by arms that sacred edifice or of perishing in
 its ruins. They indignantly rejected the notice and
 permission which was given them to retire, till the
 soldiers, provoked by their obstinate refusal, set fire to
 the building on all sides, and consumed, by this
 extraordinary kind of martyrdom, a great number of
 Phrygians, with their wives and children.<small>(<a href="nt16/161.htm">161</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="subs"><small class="ok">Subsequent edicts. </small><br>
 
 Some slight disturbances, though they were suppressed almost
 as soon as excited in Syria and the frontiers of Armenia,
 afforded the enemies of the church a very plausible occasion
 to insinuate that those troubles had been secretly fomented
 by the intrigues of the bishops, who had already forgotten
 their ostentatious professions of passive and unlimited
 obedience.<small>(<a href="nt16/162.htm">162</a>)</small> The resentment, or the fears, of Diocletian 
 at length transported him beyond the bounds of moderation
 which he had hitherto preserved, and he declared, in a
 series of cruel edicts, his intention of abolishing the
 Christian name. By the first of these edicts the governors
 of the provinces were directed to apprehend all persons of
 the ecclesiastical order; and the prisons destined for the
 vilest criminals were soon filled with a multitude of
 bishops, presbyters, deacons, readers and exorcists. By a
 second edict the magistrates were commanded to employ every
 method of severity which might reclaim them from their
 odious superstition, and oblige them to return to the
 established worship of the gods. This rigorous order was
 extended, by a subsequent edict, to the whole body of
 Christians, who were exposed to a violent and general
 persecution.<small>(<a href="nt16/163.htm">163</a>)</small> Instead of those salutary restraints which 
 had required the direct and solemn testimony of an accuser,
 it became the duty as well as the interest of the Imperial
 officers to discover, to pursue, and to torment the most
 obnoxious among the faithful. Heavy penalties were denounced
 against all who should presume to save a proscribed sectary
 from the just indignation of the gods and of the emperors.
 Yet, notwithstanding the severity of this law, the virtuous
 courage of many of the Pagans, in concealing their friends
 or relations, affords an honourable proof that the rage of
 superstition had not extinguished in their minds the
 sentiments of nature and humanity.<small>(<a href="nt16/164.htm">164</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="gener"><small class="ok">General idea of the persecution. </small><br>

Diocletian had no sooner published his edicts against the
 Christians than, as if he had been desirous of committing to
 other hands the work of persecution, he divested himself of
 the Imperial purple. The character and situation of his
 colleagues and successors sometimes urged them to enforce,
 and sometimes inclined them to suspend, the execution of
 these rigorous laws; nor can we acquire a just and distinct
 idea of this important period of ecclesiastical history
 unless we separately consider the state of Christianity, in
 the different parts of the empire, during the space of ten
 years which elapsed between the first edicts of Diocletian
 and the final peace of the church.

 The mild and humane temper of Constantius was averse to the
 oppression of any part of his subjects. The principal
 offices of his palace were exercised by Christians. He loved
 their persons, esteemed their fidelity, and entertained not
 any dislike to their religious principles. But as long as
 Constantius remained in the subordinate station of Caesar,
 it was not in his power openly to reject the edicts of
 Diocletian, or to disobey the commands of Maximian. His
 authority contributed, however, to alleviate the sufferings
 which he pitied and abhorred. He consented with reluctance
 to the ruin of the churches, but he ventured to protect the
 Christians themselves from the fury of the populace and from
 the rigour of the laws. The provinces of Gaul (under which
 we may probably include those of Britain) were indebted for
 the singular tranquillity which they enjoyed to the gentle
 interposition of their sovereign. <small>(<a href="nt16/165.htm">165</a>)</small> But Datianus, the 
 president or governor of Spain, actuated either by zeal or
 policy, chose rather to execute the public edicts of the
 emperors than to understand the secret intentions of
 Constantius; and it can scarcely be doubted that his
 provincial administration was stained with the blood of a
 few martyrs.<small>(<a href="nt16/166.htm">166</a>)</small> The elevation of Constantius to the supreme 
 and independent dignity of Augustus gave a free scope to the
 exercise of his virtues, and the shortness of his reign did
 not prevent him from establishing a system of toleration of
 which he left the precept and the example to his son
 Constantine. His fortunate son, from the first moment of his
 accession declaring himself the protector of the church, at
 length deserved the appellation of the first emperor who
 publicly professed and established the Christian religion.
 The motives of his conversion, as they may variously be
 deduced from benevolence, from policy, from conviction, or
 from remorse, and the progress of the revolution, which,
 under his powerful influence and that of his sons, rendered
 Christianity the reigning religion of the Roman empire, will
 form a very interesting and important chapter in the second
 volume of this history. At present it may be sufficient to
 observe that every victory of Constantine was productive of
 some relief or benefit to the church.
 
</p> <p id="inita"><small class="ok">in Italy and Africa, under Maximian and Severus; </small><br>

 The provinces of Italy and Africa experienced a short but
 violent persecution. The rigorous edicts of Diocletian were
 strictly and cheerfully executed by his associate Maximian,
 who had long hated the Christians, and who delighted in acts
 of blood and violence. In the autumn of the first year of
 the persecution the two emperors met at Rome to celebrate
 their triumph; several oppressive laws appear to have issued
 from their secret consultations, and the diligence of the
 magistrates was animated by the presence of their
 sovereigns. After Diocletian had divested himself of the
 purple, Italy and Africa were administered under the name of
 Severus, and were exposed, without defence, to the
 implacable resentment of his master Galerius. Among the
 martyrs of Rome, Adauctus deserves the notice of posterity.
 He was of a noble family in Italy, and had raised himself,
 through the successive honours of the palace, to the
 important office of treasurer of the private demesnes.
 Adauctus is the more remarkable for being the only person of
 rank and distinction who appears to have suffered death
 during the whole course of this general persecution.<small>(<a href="nt16/167.htm">167</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="unde"><small class="ok">under Maxentius; </small><br>
 
 The revolt of Maxentius immediately restored peace to the
 churches of Italy and Africa, and the same tyrant who
 oppressed every other class of his subjects showed himself
 just, humane, and even partial, towards the afflicted
 Christians.: He depended on their gratitude and affection,
 and very naturally presumed that the injuries which they had
 suffered, and the dangers which they still apprehended, from
 his most inveterate enemy, would secure the fidelity of a
 party already considerable by their numbers and opulence.
 <small>(<a href="nt16/168.htm">168</a>)</small> Even the conduct of Maxentius towards the bishops of 
 Rome and Carthage may be considered as the proof of his
 toleration, since it is probable that the most orthodox
 princes would adopt the same measures with regard to their
 established clergy. Marcellus, the former of those prelates,
 had thrown their capital into confusion by the severe
 penance which he imposed on a great number of Christians
 who, during the late persecution, had renounced or
 dissembled their religion. The rage of faction broke out in
 frequent and violent seditions; the blood of the faithful
 was shed by each other's hands; and the exile of Marcellus,
 whose prudence seems to have been less eminent than his
 zeal, was found to be the only measure capable of restoring
 peace to the distracted church of Rome.<small>(<a href="nt16/169.htm">169</a>)</small> The behaviour of 
 Mensurius, bishop of Carthage, appears to have been still
 more reprehensible. A deacon of that city had published a
 libel against the emperor. The offender took refuge in the
 episcopal palace, and, though it was somewhat early to
 advance any claims of ecclesiastical immunities the bishop
 refused to deliver him up to the officers of justice. For
 this treasonable resistance Mensurius was summoned to court,
 and, instead of receiving a legal sentence of death or
 banishment, he was permitted, after a short examination, to
 return to his diocese. <small>(<a href="nt16/170.htm">170</a>)</small> Such was the happy condition of 
 the Christian subjects of Maxentius, that, whenever they
 were desirous of procuring for their own use any bodies of
 martyrs, they were obliged to purchase them from the most
 distant provinces of the East. A story is related of Aglae,
 a Roman lady, descended from a consular family, and
 possessed of so ample an estate that it required the
 management of seventy-three stewards. Among these Boniface
 was the favourite of his mistress and, as Aglae mixed love
 with devotion, it is reported that he was admitted to share
 her bed. Her fortune enabled her to gratify the pious desire
 of obtaining some sacred relics from the East. She intrusted
 Boniface with a considerable sum of gold and a large
 quantity of aromatics, and her lover, attended by twelve
 horsemen and three covered chariots, undertook a remote
 pilgrimage as far as Tarsus in Cilicia.<small>(<a href="nt16/171.htm">171</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="inil"><small class="ok">in Illyricum and the East under Galerius and Maximin. </small><br>
 
 The sanguinary temper of Galerius, the first and principal
 author of the persecution, was formidable to those
 Christians whom their misfortunes had placed within the
 limits of his dominions; and it may fairly be presumed that
 many persons of a middle rank, who were not confined by the
 chains either of wealth or of poverty, very frequently
 deserted their native country, and sought a refuge in the
 milder climate of the West. As long as he commanded only the
 armies and provinces of Illyricum, he could with difficulty
 either find or make a considerable number of martyrs in a
 warlike country which had entertained the missionaries of
 the Gospel with more coldness and reluctance than any other
 part of the empire. <small>(<a href="nt16/172.htm">172</a>)</small> But when Galerius had obtained the 
 supreme power and the government of the East, he indulged in
 their fullest extent his zeal and cruelty, not only in the
 provinces of Thrace and Asia, which acknowledged his
 immediate jurisdiction, but in those of Syria, Palestine,
 and Egypt, where Maximin gratified his own inclination by
 yielding a rigorous obedience to the stern commands of his
 benefactor.<small>(<a href="nt16/173.htm">173</a>)</small> The frequent disappointments of his ambitious views, the experience of six years of persecution, and the salutary
 reflections which a lingering and painful distemper
 suggested to the mind of Galerius, at length convinced him
 that the most violent efforts of despotism are insufficient
 to extirpate a whole people, or to subdue their religious
 prejudices. Desirous of repairing the mischief that he had
 occasioned, he published in his own name, and in those of
 Licinius and Constantine, a general edict, which, after a
 pompous recital of the Imperial titles, proceeded in the
 following manner:
 
</p> <p id="galer"><small class="ok">Galerius publishes an edict of toleration</small></p> 
 <blockquote style="margin-top:-1.5ex">"Among the important cares which have occupied our mind for the utility and preservation of the empire, it was our
 intention to correct and re-establish all things according to the ancient laws and public discipline of the Romans. We were particularly desirous of reclaiming into the way of reason and nature the deluded Christians who had renounced the religion and ceremonies instituted by their fathers, and, presumptuously despising the practice of antiquity, had invented extravagant laws and opinions according to the dictates of their fancy, and had collected a various society from the different provinces of our empire. The edicts which we have published to enforce the worship of the gods having exposed many of the Christians to danger and distress, many having suffered death, and many more, who still persist in their impious folly, being left destitute of any public exercise of religion, we are disposed to extend to those unhappy men the effects of our wonted clemency. We permit them, therefore, freely to profess their private opinions, and to assemble in their conventicles without fear or molestation, provided always that they preserve a due respect to the established laws and government. By another rescript we shall signify our intentions to the judges and magistrates, and we hope that our indulgence will engage the Christians to offer up their prayers to the Deity whom they adore for our safety and prosperity, for their own, and for that of the republic." <em><small>(<a href="nt16/174.htm">174</a>)</small></em></blockquote>

<p>It is not usually in the language of edicts and manifestos that we should search for the real character of the secret motives of princes; but as these
 were the words of a dying emperor, his situation, perhaps, may be admitted as a pledge of his sincerity.</p> 

 <p id="peaceof"><small class="ok">Peace of the church. </small><br>
 
 When Galerius subscribed this edict of toleration, he was
 well assured that Licinius would readily comply with the
 inclinations of his friend and benefactor, and that any
 measures in favour of the Christians would obtain the
 approbation of Constantine. But the emperor would not
 venture to insert in the preamble the name of Maximin, whose
 consent was of the greatest importance, and who succeeded a
 few days afterwards to the provinces of Asia. In the first
 six months, however, of his new reign, Maximin affected to
 adopt the prudent counsels of his predecessor; and though he
 never condescended to secure the tranquillity of the church
 by a public edict, Sabinus, his Praetorian praefect,
 addressed a circular letter to all the governors and
 magistrates of the provinces, expatiating on the Imperial
 clemency, acknowledging the invincible obstinacy of the
 Christians, and directing the officers of justice to cease
 their ineffectual prosecutions, and to connive at the secret
 assemblies of those enthusiasts. In consequence of these
 orders, great numbers of Christians were released from
 prison, or delivered from the mines. The confessors, singing
 hymns of triumph, returned into their own countries, and
 those who had yielded to the violence of the tempest,
 solicited with tears of repentance their readmission into
 the bosom of the church.<small>(<a href="nt16/175.htm">175</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="maxim"><small class="ok">Maximin prepares to renew the persecution. </small><br>
 
 But this treacherous calm was of short duration; nor could
 the Christians of the East place any confidence in the
 character of their sovereign. Cruelty and superstition were
 the ruling passions of the soul of Maximin. The former
 suggested the means, the latter pointed out the objects, of
 persecution. The emperor was devoted to the worship of the
 gods, to the study of magic, and to the belief of oracles.
 The prophets or philosophers, whom he revered as the
 favourites of Heaven, were frequently raised to the
 government of provinces, and admitted into his most secret
 councils. They easily convinced him that the Christians had
 been indebted for their victories to their regular
 discipline, and that the weakness of polytheism had
 principally flowed from a want of union and subordination
 among the ministers of religion. A system of government was
 therefore instituted, which was evidently copied from the
 policy of the church. In all the great cities of the empire,
 the temples were repaired and beautified by the order of
 Maximin, and the officiating priests of the various deities
 were subjected to the authority of a superior pontiff
 destined to oppose the bishop, and to promote the cause of
 paganism. These pontiffs acknowledged, in their turn, the
 supreme jurisdiction of the metropolitans or high priests of
 the province, who acted as the immediate vicegerents of the
 emperor himself. A white robe was the ensign of their
 dignity; and these new prelates were carefully selected from
 the most noble and opulent families. By the influence of the
 magistrates, and of the sacerdotal order, a great number of
 dutiful addresses were obtained, particularly from the
 cities of Nicomedia, Antioch, and Tyre, which artfully
 represented the well-known intentions of the court as the
 general sense of the people; solicited the emperor to
 consult the laws of justice rather than the dictates of his
 clemency; expressed their abhorrence of the Christians, and
 humbly prayed that those impious sectaries might at least be
 excluded from the limits of their respective territories.
 The answer of Maximin to the address which he obtained from
 the citizens of Tyre is still extant. He praises their zeal
 and devotion in terms of the highest satisfaction, descants
 on the obstinate impiety of the Christians, and betrays, by
 the readiness with which he consents to their banishment,
 that he considered himself as receiving, rather than as
 conferring, an obligation. The priests as well as the
 magistrates were empowered to enforce the execution of his
 edicts, which were engraved on tables of brass; and though
 it was recommended to them to avoid the effusion of blood,
 the most cruel and ignominious punishments were inflicted on
 the refractory Christians.<small>(<a href="nt16/176.htm">176</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="endo"><small class="ok">End of the persecutions. </small><br>

The Asiatic Christians had everything to dread from the
 severity of a bigoted monarch who prepared his measures of
 violence with such deliberate policy. But a few months had
 scarcely elapsed before the edicts published by the two
 Western emperors obliged Maximim to suspend the prosecution
 of his designs: the civil war which he so rashly undertook
 against Licinius employed all his attention; and the defeat
 and death of Maximin soon delivered the church from the last
 and most implacable of her enemies.<small>(<a href="nt16/177.htm">177</a>)</small> 
 
</p> <p id="prob"><small class="ok">Probable account of the sufferings of the martyrs and confessors. </small><br>
 
 In this general view of the persecution which was first
 authorised by the edicts of Diocletian, I have purposely
 refrained from describing the particular sufferings and
 deaths of the Christian martyrs. It would have been an easy
 task, from the history of Eusebius, from the declamations of
 Lactantius, and from the most ancient acts, to collect a
 long series of horrid and disgusting pictures, and to fill
 many pages with racks and scourges, with iron hooks and
 red-hot beds, and with all the variety of tortures which
 fire and steel, savage beasts, and more savage executioners,
 could inflict on the human body. These melancholy scenes
 might be enlivened by a crowd of visions and miracles
 destined either to delay the death, to celebrate the
 triumph, or to discover the relics of those canonised saints
 who suffered for the name of Christ. But I cannot determine
 what I ought to transcribe, till I am satisfied how much I
 ought to believe. The gravest of the ecclesiastical
 historians, Eusebius himself, indirectly confesses that he
 has related whatever might redound to the glory, and that he
 has suppressed all that could tend to the disgrace, of
 religion.<small>(<a href="nt16/178.htm">178</a>)</small> Such an acknowledgment will naturally excite a 
 suspicion that a writer who has so openly violated one of
 the fundamental laws of history has not paid a very strict
 regard to the observance of the other; and the suspicion
 will derive additional credit from the character of
 Eusebius, which was less tinctured with credulity, and more
 practised in the arts of courts, than that of almost any of
 his contemporaries. Of some particular occasions, when the
 magistrates were exasperated by some personal motives of
 interest or resentment, when the zeal of the martyrs urged
 them to forget the rules of prudence, and perhaps of
 decency, to overturn the altars, to pour out imprecations
 against the emperors, or to strike the judge as he sat on
 his tribunal, it may be presumed that every mode of torture
 which cruelty could invent, or constancy could endure, was
 exhausted on those devoted victims.<small>(<a href="nt16/179.htm">179</a>)</small> Two circumstances, 
 however, have been unwarily mentioned, which insinuate that
 the general treatment of the Christians who had been
 apprehended by the officers of justice was less intolerable than it is usually imagined to have been. 1. The confessors who were condemned to work in the mines were permitted by the humanity or the negligence of their keepers to build chapels, and freely to profess their religion in the midst
 of those dreary habitations. <small>(<a href="nt16/180.htm">180</a>)</small> 2. The bishops were obliged to check and to censure the forward zeal of the Christians, who voluntarily threw themselves into the hands of the magistrates. Some of these were persons oppressed by poverty and debts, who blindly sought to terminate a miserable existence by a glorious death. Others were allured by the hope that a short confinement would expiate the sins of a whole life; and others again were actuated by the less honourable motive of deriving a plentiful subsistence, and perhaps a considerable profit, from the alms which the charity of the faithful bestowed on the prisoners.<small>(<a href="nt16/181.htm">181</a>)</small> After the church had triumphed over all her enemies, the interest as well as vanity of the captives prompted them to magnify the merit of their respective suffering. A convenient distance of time or place gave an ample scope to the progress of fiction; and the frequent instances which might be alleged of holy martyrs whose wounds had been instantly healed, whose strength had been renewed, and whose lost
 members had miraculously been restored, were extremely convenient for the purpose of removing every difficulty, and of silencing every objection. The most extravagant legends, as they conduced to the honour of the church, were applauded by the credulous multitude, countenanced by the power of the clergy, and attested by the suspicious evidence of ecclesiastical history.
 
</p> <p id="numb"><small class="ok">Number of martyrs</small><br>
 
The vague descriptions of exile and imprisonment, of pain and torture, are so easily exaggerated or softened by the pencil of an artful orator, that we are naturally induced to inquire into a fact of a more distinct and stubborn kind; the number of persons who suffered death in consequence of the edicts published by Diocletian, his associates, and his successors. The recent legendaries record whole armies and
 cities which were at once swept away by the undistinguishing
 rage of persecution. The more ancient writers content
 themselves with pouring out a liberal effusion of loose and
 tragical invectives, without condescending to ascertain the
 precise number of those persons who were permitted to seal
 with their blood their belief of the Gospel. From the
 history of Eusebius it may however be collected that only
 nine bishops were punished with death; and we are assured,
 by his particular enumeration of the martyrs of Palestine,
 that no more than ninety-two Christians were entitled to
 that honourable appellation.<small>(<a href="nt16/182.htm">182</a>)</small> As we are unacquainted with 
 the degree of episcopal zeal and courage which prevailed at
 that time, it is not in our power to draw any useful
 inferences from the former of these facts: but the latter
 may serve to justify a very important and probable
 conclusion. According to the distribution of Roman
 provinces, Palestine may be considered as the sixteenth part
 of the Eastern empire: <small>(<a href="nt16/183.htm">183</a>)</small> and since there were some 
 governors who, from a real or affected clemency, had
 preserved theirs hands unstained with the blood of the
 faithful,<small>(<a href="nt16/184.htm">184</a>)</small> it is reasonable to believe that the Country 
 which had given birth to Christianity produced at least the
 sixteenth part of the martyrs who suffered death within the
 dominions of Galerius and Maximin; the whole might
 consequently amount to about fifteen hundred, a number
 which, if it is equally divided between the ten years of the
 persecution, will allow an annual consumption of one hundred
 and fifty martyrs. Allotting the same proportion to the
 provinces of Italy, Africa, and perhaps Spain, where, at the
 end of two or three years, the rigour of the penal laws was
 either suspended or abolished, the multitude of Christians
 in the Roman empire, on whom a capital punishment was
 inflicted by a judicial sentence, will be reduced to
 somewhat less than two thousand persons. Since it cannot be
 doubted that the Christians were more numerous, and their
 enemies more exasperated, in the time of Diocletian than
 they had ever been in any former persecution, this probable
 and moderate computation may teach us to estimate the number
 of primitive saints and martyrs who sacrificed their lives
 for the important purpose of introducing Christianity into
 the world.

</p> <p id="conc"><small class="ok">Conclusion. </small><br>
 
 We shall conclude this chapter by a melancholy truth which
 obtrudes itself on the reluctant mind; that, even admitting,
 without hesitation or inquiry, all that history has
 recorded, or devotion has feigned, on the subject of
 martyrdoms, it must still be acknowledged that the
 Christians, in the course of their intestine dissensions,
 have inflicted far greater severities on each other than
 they had experienced from the zeal of infidels. During the
 ages of ignorance which followed the subversion of the Roman
 empire in the West, the bishops of the Imperial city
 extended their dominion over the laity as well as clergy of
 the Latin church. The fabric of superstition which they had
 erected, and which might long have defied the feeble efforts
 of reason, was at length assaulted by a crowd of daring
 fanatics, who, from the twelfth to the sixteenth century,
 assumed the popular character of reformers. The church of
 Rome defended by violence the empire which she had acquired
 by fraud; a system of peace and benevolence was soon
 disgraced by the proscriptions, wars, massacres, and the
 institution of the holy office. And as the reformers were
 animated by the love of civil as well as of religious
 freedom, the Catholic princes connected their own interest
 with that of the clergy, and enforced by fire and the sword
 the terrors of spiritual censures. In the Netherlands alone
 more than one hundred thousand of the subjects of Charles V.
 are said to have suffered by the hand of the executioner;
 and this extraordinary number is attested by Grotius,<small>(<a href="nt16/185.htm">185</a>)</small> a 
 man of genius and learning, who preserved his moderation
 amidst the fury of contending sects, and who composed the
 annals of his own age and country at a time when the
 invention of printing had facilitated the means of
 intelligence and increased the danger of detection. If we
 are obliged to submit our belief to the authority of
 Grotius, it must be allowed that the number of Protestants
 who were executed in a single province and a single reign, far exceeded that of the primitive martyrs in the space of three centuries, and of the Roman empire. But if the improbability of the fact itself should prevail over the weight of evidence; if Grotius should be convicted of exaggerating the merit and sufferings of the reformers; <small>(<a href="nt16/186.htm">186</a>)</small> we shall be naturally led to inquire what confidence can be placed in the doubtful and imperfect monuments of ancient credulity; what degree of credit can be assigned to a courtly bishop and a passionate declaimer, who, under the protection of Constantine, enjoyed the exclusive privilege of recording the persecutions inflicted on the Christians by the vanquished rivals or disregarded predecessors of their gracious sovereign.</p>
