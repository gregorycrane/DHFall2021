 THE vain titles of the victories of Justinian are crumbled
 into dust; but the name of the legislator is inscribed on a
 fair and everlasting monument. Under his reign, and by his
 care, the civil jurisprudence was digested in the immortal
 works of the CODE, the PANDECTS, and the INSTITUTES: <small>(<a href="nt440/001.htm">1</a>)</small> the
 public reason of the Romans has been silently or studiously
 transfused into the domestic institutions of Europe, <small>(<a href="nt440/002.htm">2</a>)</small>, and
 the laws of Justinian still command the respect or obedience
 of independent nations. Wise or fortunate is the prince who
 connects his own reputation with the honor or interest of a
 perpetual order of men. The defence of their founder is the
 first cause, which in every age has exercised the zeal and
 industry of the civilians. They piously commemorate his
 virtues; dissemble or deny his failings; and fiercely
 chastise the guilt or folly of the rebels, who presume to
 sully the majesty of the purple. The idolatry of love has
 provoked, as it usually happens, the rancor of opposition;
 the character of Justinian has been exposed to the blind
 vehemence of flattery and invective; and the injustice of a
 sect (the <I>Anti-Tribonians</I>,) has refused all praise and merit
 to the prince, his ministers, and his laws. <small>(<a href="nt440/003.htm">3</a>)</small> Attached to
 no party, interested only for the truth and candor of
 history, and directed by the most temperate and skilful
 guides, <small>(<a href="nt440/004.htm">4</a>)</small> I enter with just diffidence on the subject of
 civil law, which has exhausted so many learned lives, and
 clothed the walls of such spacious libraries. In a single,
 if possible in a short, chapter, I shall trace the Roman
 jurisprudence from Romulus to Justinian, <small>(<a href="nt440/005.htm">5</a>)</small> appreciate the
 labors of that emperor, and pause to contemplate the
 principles of a science so important to the peace and
 happiness of society. The laws of a nation form the most
 instructive portion of its history; and although I have
 devoted myself to write the annals of a declining monarchy,
 I shall embrace the occasion to breathe the pure and
 invigorating air of the republic.

</p><p id="kings"><small class="ok"><I> Laws of the kings of Rome.</i></small><br>

 The primitive government of Rome <small>(<a href="nt440/006.htm">6</a>)</small> was composed, with some political skill, of an elective king, a council of nobles,
 and a general assembly of the people. War and religion were
 administered by the supreme magistrate; and he alone
 proposed the laws, which were debated in the senate, and
 finally ratified or rejected by a majority of votes in the
 thirty <I>curiae</I> or parishes of the city. Romulus, Numa, and
 Servius Tullius, are celebrated as the most ancient
 legislators; and each of them claims his peculiar part in
 the threefold division of jurisprudence. <small>(<a href="nt440/007.htm">7</a>)</small> The laws of
 marriage, the education of children, and the authority of
 parents, which may seem to draw their origin from <I>nature</I>
 itself, are ascribed to the untutored wisdom of Romulus. The
 law of <I>nations</I> and of religious worship, which Numa
 introduced, was derived from his nocturnal converse with the
 nymph Egeria. <I>The civil</I> law is attributed to the experience
 of Servius: he balanced the rights and fortunes of the seven
 classes of citizens; and guarded, by fifty new regulations,
 the observance of contracts and the punishment of crimes.
 The state, which he had inclined towards a democracy, was
 changed by the last Tarquin into a lawless despotism; and
 when the kingly office was abolished, the patricians
 engrossed the benefits of freedom. The royal laws became
 odious or obsolete; the mysterious deposit was silently
 preserved by the priests and nobles; and at the end of sixty
 years, the citizens of Rome still complained that they were
 ruled by the arbitrary sentence of the magistrates. Yet the
 positive institutions of the kings had blended themselves
 with the public and private manners of the city, some
 fragments of that venerable jurisprudence <small>(<a href="nt440/008.htm">8</a>)</small> were compiled
 by the diligence of antiquarians, <small>(<a href="nt440/009.htm">9</a>)</small> and above twenty texts
 still speak the rudeness of the Pelasgic idiom of the
 Latins. <small>(<a href="nt440/010.htm">10</a>)</small>

</p><p id="tables"><small class="ok"><I> The twelve tables of the Decemvirs.</i></small><br>

 I shall not repeat the well-known story of the Decemvirs, <small>(<a href="nt440/011.htm">11</a>)</small> who sullied by their actions the honor of inscribing on brass, or wood, or ivory, the TWELVE TABLES of the Roman
 laws. <small>(<a href="nt440/012.htm">12</a>)</small> They were dictated by the rigid and jealous spirit of an aristocracy, which had yielded with reluctance to the just demands of the people. But the substance of the Twelve
 Tables was adapted to the state of the city; and the Romans had emerged from Barbarism, since they were capable of studying and embracing the institutions of their more enlightened neighbors. <!--   hREF="nt440/AXX.htm" (A) --> A wise Ephesian was driven by envy from his native country: before he could reach the shores of Latium, he had observed the various forms of human nature
 and civil society: he imparted his knowledge to the legislators of Rome, and a statue was erected in the forum to the perpetual memory of Hermodorus. <small>(<a href="nt440/013.htm">13</a>)</small> The names and divisions of the copper money, the sole coin of the infant state, were of Dorian origin: <small>(<a href="nt440/014.htm">14</a>)</small> the harvests of Campania
 and Sicily relieved the wants of a people whose agriculture was often interrupted by war and faction; and since the trade was established, <small>(<a href="nt440/015.htm">15</a>)</small> the deputies who sailed from the Tyber might return from the same harbors with a more precious cargo of political wisdom. The colonies of Great Greece had transported and improved the arts of their mother country. Cumae and Rhegium, Crotona and Tarentum, Agrigentum and Syracuse, were in the rank of the most flourishing
 cities. The disciples of Pythagoras applied philosophy to
 the use of government; the unwritten laws of Charondas
 accepted the aid of poetry and music, <small>(<a href="nt440/016.htm">16</a>)</small> and Zaleucus
 framed the republic of the Locrians, which stood without
 alteration above two hundred years. <small>(<a href="nt440/017.htm">17</a>)</small> From a similar
 motive of national pride, both Livy and Dionysius are
 willing to believe, that the deputies of Rome visited Athens
 under the wise and splendid administration of Pericles; and
 the laws of Solon were transfused into the twelve tables.
 If such an embassy had indeed been received from the
 Barbarians of Hesperia, the Roman name would have been
 familiar to the Greeks before the reign of Alexander; <small>(<a href="nt440/018.htm">18</a>)</small>
 and the faintest evidence would have been explored and
 celebrated by the curiosity of succeeding times. But the
 Athenian monuments are silent; nor will it seem credible
 that the patricians should undertake a long and perilous
 navigation to copy the purest model of democracy. In the
 comparison of the tables of Solon with those of the
 Decemvirs, some casual resemblance may be found; some rules
 which nature and reason have revealed to every society; some
 proofs of a common descent from Egypt or Phoenicia. <small>(<a href="nt440/019.htm">19</a>)</small> But in all the great lines of public and private jurisprudence,
 the legislators of Rome and Athens appear to be strangers or
 adverse at each other.

</p><p id="character"><small class="ok"><I> Their character and influence.</i></small><br>

 Whatever might be the origin or the merit of the twelve
 tables, <small>(<a href="nt440/020.htm">20</a>)</small> they obtained among the Romans that blind and
 partial reverence which the lawyers of every country delight
 to bestow on their municipal institutions. The study is
 recommended by Cicero <small>(<a href="nt440/021.htm">21</a>)</small> as equally pleasant and  instructive. </p>
<blockquote> "They amuse the mind by the remembrance of old words and the portrait of ancient manners; they inculcate the soundest principles of government and morals; and I am not afraid to affirm, that the brief composition of the Decemvirs surpasses in genuine value the libraries of
 Grecian philosophy. How admirable," <em>says Tully, with honest
 or affected prejudice,</em> "is the wisdom of our ancestors! We
 alone are the masters of civil prudence, and our superiority
 is the more conspicuous, if we deign to cast our eyes on the
 rude and almost ridiculous jurisprudence of Draco, of Solon,
 and of Lycurgus." </blockquote> 
<p>The twelve tables were committed to the memory of the young and the meditation of the old; they were transcribed and illustrated with learned diligence; they had escaped the flames of the Gauls, they subsisted in the age
of Justinian, and their subsequent loss has been imperfectly restored by the labors of modern critics. <small>(<a href="nt440/022.htm">22</a>)</small> But although these venerable monuments were considered as the rule of right and the fountain of justice, <small>(<a href="nt440/023.htm">23</a>)</small> they were overwhelmed by the weight and variety of new laws, which, at the end of
 five centuries, became a grievance more intolerable than the vices of the city. <small>(<a href="nt440/024.htm">24</a>)</small> Three thousand brass plates, the acts of the senate of the people, were deposited in the Capitol:
 <small>(<a href="nt440/025.htm">25</a>)</small> and some of the acts, as the Julian law against extortion, surpassed the number of a hundred chapters. <small>(<a href="nt440/026.htm">26</a>)</small>
 The Decemvirs had neglected to import the sanction of
 Zaleucus, which so long maintained the integrity of his
 republic. A Locrian, who proposed any new law, stood forth
 in the assembly of the people with a cord round his neck,
 and if the law was rejected, the innovator was instantly
 strangled.

</p><p id="people"><small class="ok"><I> Laws of the people.</i></small><br>

 The Decemvirs had been named, and their tables were
 approved, by an assembly of the centuries, in which riches
 preponderated against numbers. To the first class of
 Romans, the proprietors of one hundred thousand pounds of
 copper, <small>(<a href="nt440/027.htm">27</a>)</small> ninety-eight votes were assigned, and only
 ninety-five were left for the six inferior classes,
 distributed according to their substance by the artful
 policy of Servius. But the tribunes soon established a more
 specious and popular maxim, that every citizen has an equal
 right to enact the laws which he is bound to obey. Instead
 of the <I>centuries</I>, they convened the <I>tribes</I>; and the
 patricians, after an impotent struggle, submitted to the
 decrees of an assembly, in which their votes were confounded
 with those of the meanest plebeians. Yet as long as the
 tribes successively passed over narrow <I>bridges</I> <small>(<a href="nt440/028.htm">28</a>)</small> and gave their voices aloud, the conduct of each citizen was exposed
 to the eyes and ears of his friends and countrymen. The
 insolvent debtor consulted the wishes of his creditor; the
 client would have blushed to oppose the views of his patron;
 the general was followed by his veterans, and the aspect of
 a grave magistrate was a living lesson to the multitude. A
 new method of secret ballot abolished the influence of fear
 and shame, of honor and interest, and the abuse of freedom
 accelerated the progress of anarchy and despotism. <small>(<a href="nt440/029.htm">29</a>)</small> The
 Romans had aspired to be equal; they were levelled by the
 equality of servitude; and the dictates of Augustus were
 patiently ratified by the formal consent of the tribes or
 centuries. Once, and once only, he experienced a sincere and
 strenuous opposition. His subjects had resigned all
 political liberty; they defended the freedom of domestic
 life. A law which enforced the obligation, and strengthened
 the bonds of marriage, was clamorously rejected; Propertius,
 in the arms of Delia, applauded the victory of licentious
 love; and the project of reform was suspended till a new and
 more tractable generation had arisen in the world. <small>(<a href="nt440/030.htm">30</a>)</small> Such
 an example was not necessary to instruct a prudent usurper
 of the mischief of popular assemblies; and their abolition,
 which Augustus had silently prepared, was accomplished
 without resistance, and almost without notice, on the
 accession of his successor. <small>(<a href="nt440/031.htm">31</a>)</small> Sixty thousand plebeian
 legislators, whom numbers made formidable, and poverty
 secure, were supplanted by six hundred senators, who held
 their honors, their fortunes, and their lives, by the
 clemency of the emperor. <sup id="senate"><I> Decrees of the senate.</i></sup> The loss of executive power was alleviated by the gift of legislative authority; and Ulpian
 might assert, after the practice of two hundred years, that
 the decrees of the senate obtained the force and validity of
 laws. In the times of freedom, the resolves of the people
 had often been dictated by the passion or error of the
 moment: the Cornelian, Pompeian, and Julian laws were
 adapted by a single hand to the prevailing disorders; but
 the senate, under the reign of the Caesars, was composed of
 magistrates and lawyers, and in questions of private
 jurisprudence, the integrity of their judgment was seldom
 perverted by fear or interest. <small>(<a href="nt440/032.htm">32</a>)</small>

</p><p id="praetors"><small class="ok"><I> Edicts of the praetors.</i></small><br>

 The silence or ambiguity of the laws was supplied by the
 occasional edicts <!-- A HREF="nt440/BXX.htm" (B) --> of those magistrates who were invested with the honors of the state. <small>(<a href="nt440/033.htm">33</a>)</small> This ancient prerogative
 of the Roman kings was transferred, in their respective
 offices, to the consuls and dictators, the censors and
 praetors; and a similar right was assumed by the tribunes of
 the people, the ediles, and the proconsuls. At Rome, and in
 the provinces, the duties of the subject, and the intentions
 of the governor, were proclaimed; and the civil
 jurisprudence was reformed by the annual edicts of the
 supreme judge, the praetor of the city. <!-- a HREF="nt440/CXX.htm" (C) --> As soon as he ascended his tribunal, he announced by the voice of the
 crier, and afterwards inscribed on a white wall, the rules
 which he proposed to follow in the decision of doubtful
 cases, and the relief which his equity would afford from the
 precise rigor of ancient statutes. A principle of
 discretion more congenial to monarchy was introduced into
 the republic: the art of respecting the name, and eluding
 the efficacy, of the laws, was improved by successive
 praetors; subtleties and fictions were invented to defeat
 the plainest meaning of the Decemvirs, and where the end was
 salutary, the means were frequently absurd. The secret or
 probable wish of the dead was suffered to prevail over the
 order of succession and the forms of testaments; and the
 claimant, who was excluded from the character of heir,
 accepted with equal pleasure from an indulgent praetor the
 possession of the goods of his late kinsman or benefactor.
 In the redress of private wrongs, compensations and fines
 were substituted to the obsolete rigor of the Twelve Tables;
 time and space were annihilated by fanciful suppositions;
 and the plea of youth, or fraud, or violence, annulled the
 obligation, or excused the performance, of an inconvenient
 contract. A jurisdiction thus vague and arbitrary was
 exposed to the most dangerous abuse: the substance, as well
 as the form, of justice were often sacrificed to the
 prejudices of virtue, the bias of laudable affection, and
 the grosser seductions of interest or resentment. But the
 errors or vices of each praetor expired with his annual
 office; such maxims alone as had been approved by reason and practice were copied by succeeding judges; the rule of
 proceeding was defined by the solution of new cases; and the temptations of injustice were removed by the Cornelian law,
 which compelled the praetor of the year to adhere to the spirit and letter of his first proclamation. <small>(<a href="nt440/034.htm">34</a>)</small> It was reserved for the curiosity and learning of Adrian, to accomplish the design which had been conceived by the genius of Caesar; and the praetorship of Salvius <sup id="edict">PERPETUAL EDICT</sup>Julian, an eminent lawyer, was immortalized by the composition of the PERPETUAL EDICT. This well-digested code was ratified by the emperor and the senate; the long divorce of law and equity was at
 length reconciled; and, instead of the Twelve Tables, the Perpetual Edict was fixed as the invariable standard of civil jurisprudence. <small>(<a href="nt440/035.htm">35</a>)</small>

</p><p id="constitutions"><small class="ok"><I> Constitutions of the emperors.</i></small><br>

 From Augustus to Trajan, the modest Caesars were content to
 promulgate their edicts in the various characters of a Roman
 magistrate; <!-- a HREF="nt440/DXX.htm" (D) --> and, in the decrees of the senate, the  epistles and <I>orations</I> of the prince were respectfully
 inserted. Adrian <small>(<a href="nt440/036.htm">36</a>)</small> appears to have been the first who
 assumed, without disguise, the plenitude of legislative
 power. And this innovation, so agreeable to his active
 mind, was countenanced by the patience of the times, and his
 long absence from the seat of government. The same policy
 was embraced by succeeding monarchs, and, according to the
 harsh metaphor of Tertullian, <em class="on">"the gloomy and intricate
 forest of ancient laws was cleared away by the axe of royal
 mandates and <I>constitutions</I>."</em> <small>(<a href="nt440/037.htm">37</a>)</small> During four centuries, from
 Adrian to Justinian the public and private jurisprudence was
 moulded by the will of the sovereign; and few institutions,
 either human or divine, were permitted to stand on their
 former basis. The origin of Imperial legislation was
 concealed by the darkness of ages and the terrors of armed
 despotism; and a double tiction was propagated by the
 servility, or perhaps the ignorance, of the civilians, who
 basked in the sunshine of the Roman and Byzantine courts. 1.
 To the prayer of the ancient Caesars, the people or the
 senate had sometimes granted a personal exemption from the
 obligation and penalty of particular statutes; and each
 indulgence was an act of jurisdiction exercised by the
 republic over the first of her citizens. His humble
 privilege was at length transformed into the prerogative of
 a tyrant; and the Latin expression of <eM class="on">"released from the
 laws"</em> <small>(<a href="nt440/038.htm">38</a>)</small> was supposed to exalt the emperor above <I>all</I> human restraints, and to leave his conscience and reason as the sacred measure of his conduct. 2. A similar dependence was implied in the decrees of the senate, which, in every reign, defined the titles and powers of an elective magistrate.
 But it was not before the ideas, and even the language, of
 the Romans had been corrupted, that a <I>royal</I> law, <small>(<a href="nt440/039.htm">39</a>)</small> and an
 irrevocable gift of the people, were created by the fancy of
 Ulpian, or more probably of Tribonian himself; <small>(<a href="nt440/040.htm">40</a>)</small> and the
 origin of Imperial power, though false in fact, and slavish
 in its consequence, <sup id="power"><I> Their legislative power.</i></sup>  was supported on a principle of freedom
 and justice. </p>
<blockquote> "The pleasure of the emperor has the vigour and
 effect of law, since the Roman people, by the royal law,
 have transferred to their prince the full extent of their
 own power and sovereignty." <em><small>(<a href="nt440/041.htm">41</a>)</small></em> </blockquote> 
<p>The will of a single man, of a child perhaps, was allowed to prevail over the wisdom of ages and the inclinations of millions; and the degenerate
 Greeks were proud to declare, that in his hands alone the arbitrary exercise of legislation could be safely deposited. </p>
<blockquote> "What interest or passion," <em>exclaims Theophilus in the court
 of Justinian,</em> "can reach the calm and sublime elevation of
 the monarch? He is already master of the lives and fortunes
 of his subjects; and those who have incurred his displeasure
 are already numbered with the dead." <em><small>(<a href="nt440/042.htm">42</a>)</small></em></blockquote> 
<p> Disdaining the language of flattery, the historian may confess, that in
 questions of private jurisprudence, the absolute sovereign of a great empire can seldom be influenced by any personal considerations. Virtue, or even reason, will suggest to his impartial mind, that he is the guardian of peace and equity, and that the interest of society is inseparably connected with his own. Under the weakest and most vicious reign, the seat of justice was filled by the wisdom and integrity of Papinian and Ulpian; <small>(<a href="nt440/043.htm">43</a>)</small> and the purest materials of the Code and Pandects are inscribed with the names of Caracalla and his ministers. <small>(<a href="nt440/044.htm">44</a>)</small> The tyrant of Rome was sometimes the benefactor of the provinces. A dagger terminated the crimes
 of Domitian; but the prudence of Nerva confirmed his acts,
 which, in the joy of their deliverance, had been rescinded
 by an indignant senate. <small>(<a href="nt440/045.htm">45</a>)</small>  Yet in the <I>rescripts</I>, <small>(<a href="nt440/046.htm">46</a>)</small> <sup id="rescripts"><I>Their rescripts</I></sup> replies to the consultations of the magistrates, the wisest of princes might be deceived by a partial exposition of the case. And this abuse, which placed their hasty decisions on the same level with mature and deliberate acts of legislation, was ineffectually condemned by the sense and example of Trajan. The <I>rescripts</I> of the emperor, his <I>grants</I> and <I>decrees</I>, his <I>edicts</I> and <I>pragmatic sanctions</I>, were subscribed in purple ink, <small>(<a href="nt440/047.htm">47</a>)</small> and transmitted to the provinces as general or special laws, which the magistrates were bound to execute, and the people to obey. But as their number continually multiplied, the rule of obedience became each day more doubtful and obscure, till the will of the sovereign was fixed and ascertained in the Gregorian, the Hermogenian, and the Theodosian codes. <!-- a HREF="nt440/EXX.htm" (E) --> The two first, of which some fragments have escaped, were framed by two private lawyers, to preserve the constitutions of the Pagan emperors from Adrian to Constantine. The third, which is still extant, was digested in sixteen books by the order of the younger Theodosius to consecrate the laws of the Christian princes from Constantine to his own reign. But the three codes obtained an equal authority in the tribunals; and any act which was not included in the sacred deposit might be disregarded by the judge as epurious or obsolete. <small>(<a href="nt440/048.htm">48</a>)</small>

</p><p id="forms"><small class="ok"><I>Forms of the Roman law.</i></small><br>

 Among savage nations, the want of letters is imperfectly
 supplied by the use of visible signs, which awaken
 attention, and perpetuate the remembrance of any public or
 private transaction. The jurisprudence of the first Romans
 exhibited the scenes of a pantomime; the words were adapted
 to the gestures, and the slightest error or neglect in the
 <I>forms</I> of proceeding was sufficient to annul the <I>substance</I> of
 the fairest claim. The communion of the marriage- life was
 denoted by the necessary elements of fire and water; <small>(<a href="nt440/049.htm">49</a>)</small> and the divorced wife resigned the bunch of keys, by the
 delivery of which she had been invested with the government
 of the family. The manumission of a son, or a slave, was
 performed by turning him round with a gentle blow on the
 cheek; a work was prohibited by the casting of a stone;
 prescription was interrupted by the breaking of a branch;
 the clinched fist was the symbol of a pledge or deposit; the
 right hand was the gift of faith and confidence. The
 indenture of covenants was a broken straw; weights and
 scales were introduced into every payment, and the heir who
 accepted a testament was sometimes obliged to snap his
 fingers, to cast away his garments, and to leap or dance
 with real or affected transport. <small>(<a href="nt440/050.htm">50</a>)</small> If a citizen pursued
 any stolen goods into a neighbor's house, he concealed his
 nakedness with a linen towel, and hid his face with a mask
 or basin, lest he should encounter the eyes of a virgin or a
 matron. <small>(<a href="nt440/051.htm">51</a>)</small> In a civil action the plaintiff touched the ear
 of his witness, seized his reluctant adversary by the neck,
 and implored, in solemn lamentation, the aid of his
 fellow-citizens. The two competitors grasped each other's
 hand as if they stood prepared for combat before the
 tribunal of the praetor; he commanded them to produce the
 object of the dispute; they went, they returned with
 measured steps, and a clod of earth was cast at his feet to
 represent the field for which they contended. This occult
 science of the words and actions of law was the inheritance
 of the pontiffs and patricians. Like the Chaldean
 astrologers, they announced to their clients the days of
 business and repose; these important trifles were interwoven
 with the religion of Numa; and after the publication of the
 Twelve Tables, the Roman people was still enslaved by the
 ignorance of judicial proceedings. The treachery of some
 plebeian officers at length revealed the profitable mystery:
 in a more enlightened age, the legal actions were derided
 and observed; and the same antiquity which sanctified the
 practice, obliterated the use and meaning of this primitive
 language. <small>(<a href="nt440/052.htm">52</a>)</small>

</p><p id="lawyers"><small class="ok"><I> Succession of the civil lawyers. </i></small><br>

 A more liberal art was cultivated, however, by the sage of
 Rome, who, in a stricter sense, may be considered as the
 authors of the civil law. The alteration of the idiom and
 manners of the Romans rendered the style of the Twelve
 Tables less familiar to each rising generation, and the
 doubtful passages were imperfectly explained by the study of
 legal antiquarians. To define the ambiguities, to
 circumscribe the latitude, to apply the principles, to
 extend the consequences, to reconcile the real or apparent
 contradictions, was a much nobler and more important task;
 and the province of legislation was silently invaded by the
 expounders of ancient statutes. Their subtle interpretations
 concurred with the equity of the praetor, to reform the
 tyranny of the darker ages: however strange or intricate the
 means, it was the aim of artificial jurisprudence to restore
 the simple dictates of nature and reason, and the skill of
 private citizens was usefully employed to undermine the
 public institutions of their country. <!-- a HREF="nt440/FXX.htm" (F) --> The revolution of
 almost one thousand years, from the Twelve Tables to the
 reign of Justinian, may be divided into three periods,
 almost equal in duration, and distinguished from each other
 by the mode of instruction and the character of the
 civilians. <small>(<a href="nt440/053.htm">53</a>)</small><sup id="first"><I>The first period, A.U.C. 303-648.</I></sup> Pride and ignorance contributed, during the first period, to confine within narrow limits the science of the Roman law. On the public days of market or assembly, the masters of the art were seen walking in the forum ready to
 impart the needful advice to the meanest of their
 fellow-citizens, from whose votes, on a future occasion,
 they might solicit a grateful return. As their years and
 honors increased, they seated themselves at home on a chair
 or throne, to expect with patient gravity the visits of
 their clients, who at the dawn of day, from the town and
 country, began to thunder at their door. The duties of
 social life, and the incidents of judicial proceeding, were
 the ordinary subject of these consultations, and the verbal
 or written opinion of the <I>jurisconsults</I> was framed
 according to the rules of prudence and law. The youths of
 their own order and family were permitted to listen; their
 children enjoyed the benefit of more private lessons, and
 the Mucian race was long renowned for the hereditary
 knowledge of the civil law. <sup id="second"><I>Second period, A.U.C. 648-988</i></sup> The second period, the learned and splendid age of jurisprudence, may be extended from the birth of Cicero to the reign of Severus Alexander. A system was formed, schools were instituted, books were composed, and both the living and the dead became subservient to the instruction of the student. The <I>tripartite</I> of Aelius Paetus, surnamed Catus, or the Cunning, was preserved as the oldest work of Jurisprudence. Cato the censor derived some additional fame from his legal studies, and those of his son: the kindred appellation of Mucius Scaevola was illustrated by three sages of the law; but the perfection of the science was ascribed to Servius Sulpicius, their disciple, and the friend of Tully; and the long succession,
 which shone with equal lustre under the republic and under the Caesars, is finally closed by the respectable characters of Papinian, of Paul, and of Ulpian. Their names, and the various titles of their productions, have been minutely preserved, and the example of Labeo may suggest some idea of their diligence and fecundity. That eminent lawyer of the Augustan age divided the year between the city and country, between business and composition; and four hundred books are enumerated as the fruit of his retirement. Of the collection of his rival Capito, the two hundred and fifty-ninth book is expressly quoted; and few teachers could deliver their opinions in less than a century of volumes. <sup id="third"><I>Third period, A.U.C. 988-1230.</i></sup> In the third period, between the reigns of Alexander and Justinian, the oracles of jurisprudence were almost mute. The measure of curiosity had been filled: the throne was occupied by tyrants and Barbarians, the active spirits were  diverted by religious disputes, and the professors of Rome, Constantinople, and Berytus, were humbly content to repeat the lessons of their more enlightened predecessors. From the slow advances and rapid decay of these legal studies, it may be inferred, that they require a state of peace and refinement. From the multitude of voluminous civilians who fill the intermediate space, it is evident that such studies may be pursued, and such works may be performed, with a common share of judgment, experience, and industry. The genius of Cicero and Virgil was more sensibly felt, as each
 revolving age had been found incapable of producing a similar or a second: but the most eminent teachers of the law were assured of leaving disciples equal or superior to themselves in merit and reputation.

</p><p id="philosophy"><small class="ok"><I>Their philosophy.</i></small><br>

 The jurisprudence which had been grossly adapted to the
 wants of the first Romans, was polished and improved in the
 seventh century of the city, by the alliance of Grecian
 philosophy. The Scaevolas had been taught by use and
 experience; but Servius Sulpicius <!-- a HREF="nt440/GXX.htm" (G) --> was the first civilian who established his art on a certain and general theory. <small>(<a href="nt440/054.htm">54</a>)</small>
 For the discernment of truth and falsehood he applied, as an
 infallible rule, the logic of Aristotle and the stoics,
 reduced particular cases to general principles, and diffused
 over the shapeless mass the light of order and eloquence.
 Cicero, his contemporary and friend, declined the reputation
 of a professed lawyer; but the jurisprudence of his country
 was adorned by his incomparable genius, which converts into
 gold every object that it touches. After the example of
 Plato, he composed a republic; and, for the use of his
 republic, a treatise of laws; in which he labors to deduce
 from a celestial origin the wisdom and justice of the Roman
 constitution. The whole universe, according to his sublime
 hypothesis, forms one immense commonwealth: gods and men,
 who participate of the same essence, are members of the same
 community; reason prescribes the law of nature and nations;
 and all positive institutions, however modified by accident
 or custom, are drawn from the rule of right, which the Deity
 has inscribed on every virtuous mind. From these
 philosophical mysteries, he mildly excludes the sceptics who
 refuse to believe, and the epicureans who are unwilling to
 act. The latter disdain the care of the republic: he
 advises them to slumber in their shady gardens. But he
 humbly entreats that the new academy would be silent, since
 her bold objections would too soon destroy the fair and well
 ordered structure of his lofty system. <small>(<a href="nt440/055.htm">55</a>)</small> Plato, Aristotle,
 and Zeno, he represents as the only teachers who arm and
 instruct a citizen for the duties of social life. Of these,
 the armor of the stoics <small>(<a href="nt440/056.htm">56</a>)</small> was found to be of the firmest
 temper; and it was chiefly worn, both for use and ornament,
 in the schools of jurisprudence. From the portico, the
 Roman civilians learned to live, to reason, and to die: but
 they imbibed in some degree the prejudices of the sect; the
 love of paradox, the pertinacious habits of dispute, and a
 minute attachment to words and verbal distinctions. The
 superiority of <I>form</I> to <I>matter</I> was introduced to ascertain
 the right of property: and the equality of crimes is
 countenanced by an opinion of Trebatius, <small>(<a href="nt440/057.htm">57</a>)</small> that he who
 touches the ear, touches the whole body; and that he who
 steals from a heap of corn, or a hogshead of wine, is guilty
 of the entire theft. <small>(<a href="nt440/058.htm">58</a>)</small>

</p><p id="authority"><small class="ok"><I>Authority. </i></small><br>

 Arms, eloquence, and the study of the civil law, promoted a
 citizen to the honors of the Roman state; and the three
 professions were sometimes more conspicuous by their union
 in the same character. In the composition of the edict, a
 learned praetor gave a sanction and preference to his
 private sentiments; the opinion of a censor, or a counsel,
 was entertained with respect; and a doubtful interpretation
 of the laws might be supported by the virtues or triumphs of
 the civilian. The patrician arts were long protected by the
 veil of mystery; and in more enlightened times, the freedom
 of inquiry established the general principles of
 jurisprudence. Subtile and intricate cases were elucidated
 by the disputes of the forum: rules, axioms, and
 definitions, <small>(<a href="nt440/059.htm">59</a>)</small> were admitted as the genuine dictates of
 reason; and the consent of the legal professors was
 interwoven into the practice of the tribunals. But these
 interpreters could neither enact nor execute the laws of the
 republic; and the judges might disregard the authority of
 the Scaevolas themselves, which was often overthrown by the
 eloquence or sophistry of an ingenious pleader. <small>(<a href="nt440/060.htm">60</a>)</small> Augustus
 and Tiberius were the first to adopt, as a useful engine,
 the science of the civilians; and their servile labors
 accommodated the old system to the spirit and views of
 despotism. Under the fair pretence of securing the dignity
 of the art, the privilege of subscribing legal and valid
 opinions was confined to the sages of senatorian or
 equestrian rank, who had been previously approved by the
 judgment of the prince; and this monopoly prevailed, till
 Adrian restored the freedom of the profession to every
 citizen conscious of his abilities and knowledge. The
 discretion of the praetor was now governed by the lessons of
 his teachers; the judges were enjoined to obey the comment
 as well as the text of the law; and the use of codicils was
 a memorable innovation, which Augustus ratified by the
 advice of the civilians. <small>(<a href="nt440/061.htm">61</a>)</small> <!-- a HREF="NT440/HXX.HTM" (H) -->

</p><p id="sects"><small class="ok"><I>Sects. </i></small><br>

 The most absolute mandate could only require that the judges
 should agree with the civilians, if the civilians agreed
 among themselves. But positive institutions are often the
 result of custom and prejudice; laws and language are
 ambiguous and arbitrary; where reason is incapable of
 pronouncing, the love of argument is inflamed by the envy of
 rivals, the vanity of masters, the blind attachment of their
 disciples; and the Roman jurisprudence was divided by the
 once famous sects of the <I>Proculians</I> and <I>Sabinians</I>. <small>(<a href="nt440/062.htm">62</a>)</small> Two
 sages of the law, Ateius Capito and Antistius Labeo, <small>(<a href="nt440/063.htm">63</a>)</small>
 adorned the peace of the Augustan age; the former
 distinguished by the favor of his sovereign; the latter more
 illustrious by his contempt of that favor, and his stern
 though harmless opposition to the tyrant of Rome. Their
 legal studies were influenced by the various colors of their
 temper and principles. Labeo was attached to the form of the
 old republic; his rival embraced the more profitable
 substance of the rising monarchy. But the disposition of a
 courtier is tame and submissive; and Capito seldom presumed
 to deviate from the sentiments, or at least from the words,
 of his predecessors; while the bold republican pursued his
 independent ideas without fear of paradox or innovations.
 The freedom of Labeo was enslaved, however, by the rigor of
 his own conclusions, and he decided, according to the letter
 of the law, the same questions which his indulgent
 competitor resolved with a latitude of equity more suitable
 to the common sense and feelings of mankind. If a fair
 exchange had been substituted to the payment of money,
 Capito still considered the transaction as a legal sale; <small>(<a href="nt440/064.htm">64</a>)</small>
 and he consulted nature for the age of puberty, without
 confining his definition to the precise period of twelve or
 fourteen years. <small>(<a href="nt440/065.htm">65</a>)</small> This opposition of sentiments was
 propagated in the writings and lessons of the two founders;
 the schools of Capito and Labeo maintained their inveterate
 conflict from the age of Augustus to that of Adrian; <small>(<a href="nt440/066.htm">66</a>)</small> and
 the two sects derived their appellations from Sabinus and
 Proculus, their most celebrated teachers. The names of
 <I>Cassians</I> and <I>Pegasians</I> were likewise applied to the same
 parties; but, by a strange reverse, the popular cause was in
 the hands of Pegasus, <small>(<a href="nt440/067.htm">67</a>)</small> a timid slave of Domitian, while
 the favorite of the Caesars was represented by Cassius, <small>(<a href="nt440/068.htm">68</a>)</small>
 who gloried in his descent from the patriot assassin. By
 the perpetual edict, the controversies of the sects were in
 a great measure determined. For that important work, the
 emperor Adrian preferred the chief of the Sabinians: the
 friends of monarchy prevailed; but the moderation of Salvius
 Julian insensibly reconciled the victors and the vanquished.
 Like the contemporary philosophers, the lawyers of the age
 of the Antonines disclaimed the authority of a master, and
 adopted from every system the most probable doctrines. <small>(<a href="nt440/069.htm">69</a>)</small>
 But their writings would have been less voluminous, had
 their choice been more unanimous. The conscience of the
 judge was perplexed by the number and weight of discordant
 testimonies, and every sentence that his passion or interest
 might pronounce was justified by the sanction of some
 venerable name. An indulgent edict of the younger
 Theodosius excused him from the labor of comparing and
 weighing their arguments. Five civilians, Caius, Papinian,
 Paul, Ulpian, and Modestinus, were established as the
 oracles of jurisprudence: a majority was decisive: but if
 their opinions were equally divided, a casting vote was
 ascribed to the superior wisdom of Papinian. <small>(<a href="nt440/070.htm">70</a>)</small>

</p><p id="reformation"><small class="ok"><I>Reformation of the Roman law by Justinian, A.D. 527, etc. </i></small><br>

 When Justinian ascended the throne, the reformation of the
 Roman jurisprudence was an arduous but indispensable task.
 In the space of ten centuries, the infinite variety of laws
 and legal opinions had filled many thousand volumes, which
 no fortune could purchase and no capacity could digest.
 Books could not easily be found; and the judges, poor in the
 midst of riches, were reduced to the exercise of their
 illiterate discretion. The subjects of the Greek provinces
 were ignorant of the language that disposed of their lives
 and properties; and the <I>barbarous</I> dialect of the Latins was
 imperfectly studied in the academies of Berytus and
 Constantinople. As an Illyrian soldier, that idiom was
 familiar to the infancy of Justinian; his youth had been
 instructed by the lessons of jurisprudence, and his Imperial
 choice selected the most learned civilians of the East, to
 labor with their sovereign in the work of reformation. <small>(<a href="nt440/071.htm">71</a>)</small>
 The theory of professors was assisted by the practice of
 advocates, and the experience of magistrates; <sup id="tribonian"><I>Tribonian, A.D. 527-546.</i></sup> and the whole undertaking was animated by the spirit of Tribonian. <small>(<a href="nt440/072.htm">72</a>)</small>  This extraordinary man, the object of so much praise and censure, was a native of Side in Pamphylia; and his genius, like that of Bacon, embraced, as his own, all the business and knowledge of the age. Tribonian composed, both in prose and verse, on a strange diversity of curious and abstruse subjects: <small>(<a href="nt440/073.htm">73</a>)</small> a double panegyric of Justinian and the life of the philosopher Theodotus; the nature of happiness and the duties of government; Homer's catalogue and the four-and-twenty sorts of metre; the astronomical canon of Ptolemy; the changes of the months; the houses of the
 planets; and the harmonic system of the world. To the literature of Greece he added the use of the Latin tonque; the Roman civilians were deposited in his library and in his mind; and he most assiduously cultivated those arts which
 opened the road of wealth and preferment. From the bar of
 the Praetorian praefects, he raised himself to the honors of
 quaestor, of consul, and of master of the offices: the
 council of Justinian listened to his eloquence and wisdom;
 and envy was mitigated by the gentleness and affability of
 his manners. The reproaches of impiety and avarice have
 stained the virtue or the reputation of Tribonian. In a
 bigoted and persecuting court, the principal minister was
 accused of a secret aversion to the Christian faith, and was
 supposed to entertain the sentiments of an Atheist and a
 Pagan, which have been imputed, inconsistently enough, to
 the last philosophers of Greece. His avarice was more
 clearly proved and more sensibly felt. If he were swayed by
 gifts in the administration of justice, the example of Bacon
 will again occur; nor can the merit of Tribonian atone for
 his baseness, if he degraded the sanctity of his profession;
 and if laws were every day enacted, modified, or repealed,
 for the base consideration of his private emolument. In the
 sedition of Constantinople, his removal was granted to the
 clamors, perhaps to the just indignation, of the people: but
 the quaestor was speedily restored, and, till the hour of
 his death, he possessed, above twenty years, the favor and
 confidence of the emperor. His passive and dutiful
 submission had been honored with the praise of Justinian
 himself, whose vanity was incapable of discerning how often
 that submission degenerated into the grossest adulation.
 Tribonian adored the virtues of his gracious of his gracious
 master; the earth was unworthy of such a prince; and he
 affected a pious fear, that Justinian, like Elijah or
 Romulus, would be snatched into the air, and translated
 alive to the mansions of celestial glory. <small>(<a href="nt440/074.htm">74</a>)</small>

</p><p id="justinian"><small class="ok"><I>The code of Justinian, A.D. 528,February 13; A.D.529, April 7. </i></small><br>

 If Caesar had achieved the reformation of the Roman law, his
 creative genius, enlightened by reflection and study, would
 have given to the world a pure and original system of
 jurisprudence. Whatever flattery might suggest, the emperor
 of the East was afraid to establish his private judgment as
 the standard of equity: in the possession of legislative
 power, he borrowed the aid of time and opinion; and his
 laborious compilations are guarded by the sages and
 legislature of past times. Instead of a statue cast in a
 simple mould by the hand of an artist, the works of
 Justinian represent a tessellated pavement of antique and
 costly, but too often of incoherent, fragments. In the
 first year of his reign, he directed the faithful Tribonian,
 and nine learned associates, to revise the ordinances of his
 predecessors, as they were contained, since the time of
 Adrian, in the Gregorian Hermogenian, and Theodosian codes;
 to purge the errors and contradictions, to retrench whatever
 was obsolete or superfluous, and to select the wise and
 salutary laws best adapted to the practice of the tribunals
 and the use of his subjects. The work was accomplished in
 fourteen months; and the twelve books or <I>tables</I>, which the
 new decemvirs produced, might be designed to imitate the
 labors of their Roman predecessors. The new CODE of
 Justinian was honored with his name, and confirmed by his
 royal signature: authentic transcripts were multiplied by
 the pens of notaries and scribes; they were transmitted to
 the magistrates of the European, the Asiatic, and afterwards
 the African provinces; and the law of the empire was
 proclaimed on solemn festivals at the doors of churches. <sup id="pandects"><I>The Pandects, or Digest, A.D. 530, Dec 15; A.D. 533, Dec. 16. </i></sup> A more arduous operation was still behind &#8212; to extract the spirit of jurisprudence from the decisions and conjectures,
 the questions and disputes, of the Roman civilians. Seventeen lawyers, with Tribonian at their head, were appointed by the emperor to exercise an absolute
 jurisdiction over the works of their predecessors. If they had obeyed his commands in ten years, Justinian would have been satisfied with their diligence; and the rapid composition of the DIGEST or PANDECTS, <small>(<a href="nt440/075.htm">75</a>)</small> in three years, will deserve praise or censure, according to the merit of the execution. From the library of Tribonian, they chose forty, the most eminent civilians of former times: <small>(<a href="nt440/076.htm">76</a>)</small> two thousand treatises were comprised in an abridgment of fifty books; and it has been carefully recorded, that three millions of lines or sentences, <small>(<a href="nt440/077.htm">77</a>)</small> were reduced, in this abstract, to the moderate number of one hundred and fifty thousand. The edition of this great work was delayed a month after that of the INSTITUTES; and it seemed reasonable that the elements should precede the digest of the Roman law. As soon as the emperor had approved their labors, he ratified, by his legislative power, the speculations of these private citizens: their commentaries, on the twelve tables, the perpetual edict, the laws of the people, and the decrees of the senate, succeeded to the authority of the text; and the text was abandoned, as a useless, though venerable, relic of antiquity. The <I>Code</I>, the <I>Pandects</I>, and the <I>Institutes</I>, were declared to be the legitimate system of civil jurisprudence; they alone were admitted into the tribunals, and they alone were taught in the academies of Rome, Constantinople, and Berytus. Justinian addressed to the senate and provinces his <I>eternal oracles</I>; and his pride, under the mask of piety, ascribed the consummation of this great design to the support and inspiration of the Deity.

</p><p id="praise"><small class="ok"><I>Praise and censure of the Code and Pandects. </i></small><br>

 Since the emperor declined the fame and envy of original
 composition, we can only require, at his hands, method
 choice, and fidelity, the humble, though indispensable,
 virtues of a compiler. Among the various combinations of
 ideas, it is difficult to assign any reasonable preference;
 but as the order of Justinian is different in his three
 works, it is possible that all may be wrong; and it is
 certain that two cannot be right. In the selection of
 ancient laws, he seems to have viewed his predecessors
 without jealousy, and with equal regard: the series could
 not ascend above the reign of Adrian, and the narrow
 distinction of Paganism and Christianity, introduced by the
 superstition of Theodosius, had been abolished by the
 consent of mankind. But the jurisprudence of the Pandects is
 circumscribed within a period of a hundred years, from the
 perpetual edict to the death of Severus Alexander: the
 civilians who lived under the first Caesars are seldom
 permitted to speak, and only three names can be attributed
 to the age of the republic. The favorite of Justinian (it
 has been fiercely urged) was fearful of encountering the
 light of freedom and the gravity of Roman sages. Tribonian
 condemned to oblivion the genuine and native wisdom of Cato,
 the Scaevolas, and Sulpicius; while he invoked spirits more
 congenial to his own, the Syrians, Greeks, and Africans, who
 flocked to the Imperial court to study Latin as a foreign
 tongue, and jurisprudence as a lucrative profession. But
 the ministers of Justinian, <small>(<a href="nt440/078.htm">78</a>)</small> were instructed to labor,
 not for the curiosity of antiquarians, but for the immediate
 benefit of his subjects. It was their duty to select the
 useful and practical parts of the Roman law; and the writings of the old republicans, however curious on excellent, were no longer suited to the new system of manners, religion, and government. Perhaps, if the preceptors and friends of Cicero were still alive, our candor would acknowledge, that, except in purity of language, <small>(<a href="nt440/079.htm">79</a>)</small> their intrinsic merit was excelled by the school of Papinian and Ulpian. The science of the laws is the slow growth of time and experience, and the advantage both of method and materials, is naturally assumed by the most recent authors. The civilians of the reign of the Antonines had studied the works of their predecessors: their philosophic spirit had mitigated the rigor of antiquity, simplified the forms of proceeding, and emerged from the jealousy and prejudice of the rival sects. The choice of the authorities that compose the Pandects depended on the judgment of Tribonian: but the power of his sovereign could not absolve him from the sacred obligations of truth and fidelity. As the legislator of the empire, Justinian might repeal the acts of the Antonines, or condemn, as seditious, the free principles, which were maintained by the last of the <I>Roman</I> lawyers. <small>(<a href="nt440/080.htm">80</a>)</small> But the existence of past facts is placed beyond the reach of despotism; and the emperor was guilty of fraud and forgery, when he corrupted the integrity of their text, inscribed with their venerable names the words and ideas of his servile reign, <small>(<a href="nt440/081.htm">81</a>)</small> and suppressed, by the hand of power, the pure and authentic copies of their sentiments. The changes and interpolations of Tribonian and his colleagues are excused by the pretence of uniformity: but their cares have been insufficient, and the <I>antinomies</I>, or contradictions of the Code and Pandects, still exercise the patience and subtilty of modern civilians. <small>(<a href="nt440/082.htm">82</a>)</small>

</p><p id="loss"><small class="ok"><I>Loss of the ancient jurisprudence. </i></small><br>

A rumour devoid of evidence has been propagated by the enemies of Justinian; that the jurisprudence of ancient Rome was reduced to ashes by the author of the Pandects, from the vain persuasion, that it was now either false or superfluous. Without usurping an office so invidious, the emperor might safely commit to ignorance and time the accomplishments of this destructive wish. Before the
 invention of printing and paper, the labor and the materials
 of writing could be purchased only by the rich; and it may
 reasonably be computed, that the price of books was a
 hundred fold their present value. <small>(<a href="nt440/083.htm">83</a>)</small> Copies were slowly
 multiplied and cautiously renewed: the hopes of profit
 tempted the sacrilegious scribes to erase the characters of
 antiquity, <!-- a HREF="nt440/IXX.htm" (I) --> and Sophocles or Tacitus were obliged to
 resign the parchment to missals, homilies, and the golden
 legend. <small>(<a href="nt440/084.htm">84</a>)</small> If such was the fate of the most beautiful
 compositions of genius, what stability could be expected for
 the dull and barren works of an obsolete science? The books
 of jurisprudence were interesting to few, and entertaining
 to none: their value was connected with present use, and
 they sunk forever as soon as that use was superseded by the
 innovations of fashion, superior merit, or public authority.
 In the age of peace and learning, between Cicero and the
 last of the Antonines, many losses had been already
 sustained, and some luminaries of the school, or forum, were
 known only to the curious by tradition and report. Three
 hundred and sixty years of disorder and decay accelerated
 the progress of oblivion; and it may fairly be presumed,
 that of the writings, which Justinian is accused of
 neglecting, many were no longer to be found in the libraries
 of the East. <small>(<a href="nt440/085.htm">85</a>)</small> The copies of Papinian, or Ulpian, which
 the reformer had proscribed, were deemed unworthy of future
 notice: the Twelve Tables and praetorian edicts insensibly
 vanished, and the monuments of ancient Rome were neglected
 or destroyed by the envy and ignorance of the Greeks. Even
 the Pandects themselves have escaped with difficulty and
 danger from the common shipwreck, and criticism has
 pronounced that <I>all</I> the editions and manuscripts of the West
 are derived from <I>one</I> original. <small>(<a href="nt440/086.htm">86</a>)</small> It was transcribed at
 Constantinople in the beginning of the seventh century, <small>(<a href="nt440/087.htm">87</a>)</small>
 was successively transported by the accidents of war and
 commerce to Amalphi, <small>(<a href="nt440/088.htm">88</a>)</small> Pisa, <small>(<a href="nt440/089.htm">89</a>)</small> and Florence, <small>(<a href="nt440/090.htm">90</a>)</small> and is
 now deposited as a sacred relic <small>(<a href="nt440/091.htm">91</a>)</small> in the ancient palace of the republic. <small>(<a href="nt440/092.htm">92</a>)</small>

</p><p id="inconstancy"><small class="ok"><I>Legal inconstancy of Justinian. </i></small><br>

 It is the first care of a reformer to prevent any future
 reformation. To maintain the text of the Pandects, the
 Institutes, and the Code, the use of ciphers and
 abbreviations was rigorously proscribed; and as Justinian
 recollected, that the perpetual edict had been buried under
 the weight of commentators, he denounced the punishment of
 forgery against the rash civilians who should presume to
 interpret or pervert the will of their sovereign. The
 scholars of Accursius, of Bartolus, of Cujacius, should
 blush for their accumulated guilt, unless they dare to
 dispute his right of binding the authority of his
 successors, and the native freedom of the mind. But the
 emperor was unable to fix his own inconstancy; and, while he
 boasted of renewing the exchange of Diomede, of transmuting
 brass into gold, <small>(<a href="nt440/093.htm">93</a>)</small> discovered the necessity of purifying
 his gold from the mixture of baser alloy. Six years had not
 elapsed from the publication of the Code, before he
 condemned the imperfect attempt, <sup id="secondedition"><I>Second edition of the Code, A.D. 534, Nov 16. </i></sup> by a new and more accurate edition of the same work; which he enriched with two hundred
 of his own laws, and fifty decisions of the darkest and most intricate points of jurisprudence. Every year, or, according to Procopius, each day, of his long reign, was marked by some legal innovation. Many of his acts were
 rescinded by himself; many were rejected by his successors; many have been obliterated by time; but the number of sixteen EDICTS, <sup id="novels"><I>The Novels, A.D. 534-565. </i></sup>  and one hundred and sixty-eight NOVELS, <small>(<a href="nt440/094.htm">94</a>)</small> has been admitted into the authentic body of the civil jurisprudence. In the opinion of a philosopher superior to the prejudices of his profession, these incessant, and, for the most part, trifling alterations, can be only explained by the venal spirit of a prince, who sold without shame his judgments and his laws. <small>(<a href="nt440/095.htm">95</a>)</small> The charge of the secret historian is indeed explicit and vehement; but the sole instance, which he produces, may be ascribed to the devotion as well as to the avarice of Justinian. A wealthy bigot had bequeathed his inheritance to the church of Emesa; and its value was enhanced by the dexterity of an artist, who subscribed confessions of debt and promises of payment with the names of the richest Syrians. They pleaded the
 established prescription of thirty or forty years; but their defence was overruled by a retrospective edict, which extended the claims of the church to the term of a century; an edict so pregnant with injustice and disorder, that,
 after serving this occasional purpose, it was prudently abolished in the same reign. <small>(<a href="nt440/096.htm">96</a>)</small> If candour will acquit the emperor himself, and transfer the corruption to his wife and favorites, the suspicion of so foul a vice must still degrade the majesty of his laws; and the advocates of Justinian may acknowledge, that such levity, whatsoever be the motive, is unworthy of a legislator and a man.

 Monarchs seldom condescend to become the preceptors of their
 subjects; and some praise is due to Justinian, by whose
 command an ample system was reduced to a short and
 elementary treatise. Among the various institutes of the
 Roman law, <small>(<a href="nt440/097.htm">97</a>)</small> those of Caius <small>(<a href="nt440/098.htm">98</a>)</small> were the most popular in
 the East and West; and their use may be considered as an
 evidence of their merit. They were selected by the Imperial
 delegates, Tribonian, Theophilus, and Dorotheus; and the
 freedom and purity of the Antonines was incrusted with the
 coarser materials of a degenerate age. The same volume
 which introduced the youth of Rome, Constantinople, and
 Berytus, to the gradual study of the Code and Pandects, is
 still precious to the historian, the philosopher, and the
 magistrate. The INSTITUTES of Justinian are divided into
 four books: they proceed, with no contemptible method, from,
 1. <I>Persons</I>, to, 2. <I>Things</I>, and from things, to, 3.  <I> Actions</I>; and the article 4., of <I>Private Wrongs</I>, is  terminated by the principles of <I>Criminal Law</I>. <!-- a HREF="nt440/JXX.htm" (J) -->

The distinction of ranks and <I>persons</I> is the firmest basis of
 a mixed and limited government. In France, the remains of
 liberty are kept alive by the spirit, the honours, and even
 the prejudices, of fifty thousand nobles. <small>(<a href="nt440/099.htm">99</a>)</small> Two hundred
 families <!-- a HREF="nt440/KXX.htm" (K) --> supply, in lineal descent, the second branch of English legislature, which maintains, between the king and
 commons, the balance of the constitution. A gradation of
 patricians and plebeians, of strangers and subjects, has
 supported the aristocracy of Genoa, Venice, and ancient
 Rome. The perfect equality of men is the point in which the
 extremes of democracy and despotism are confounded; since
 the majesty of the prince or people would be offended, if
 any heads were exalted above the level of their
 fellow-slaves or fellow-citizens. In the decline of the
 Roman empire, the proud distinctions of the republic were
 gradually abolished, and the reason or instinct of Justinian
 completed the simple form of an absolute monarchy. The
 emperor could not eradicate the popular reverence which
 always waits on the possession of hereditary wealth, or the
 memory of famous ancestors. He delighted to honor, with
 titles and emoluments, his generals, magistrates, and
 senators; and his precarious indulgence communicated some
 rays of their glory to the persons of their wives and
 children. But in the eye of the law, all Roman citizens
 were equal, and all subjects of the empire were citizens of
 Rome. That inestimable character was degraded to an
 obsolete and empty name. The voice of a Roman could no
 longer enact his laws, or create the annual ministers of his
 power: his constitutional rights might have checked the
 arbitrary will of a master: and the bold adventurer from
 Germany or Arabia was admitted, with equal favor, to the
 civil and military command, which the citizen alone had been
 once entitled to assume over the conquests of his fathers.
 The first Caesars had scrupulously guarded the distinction
 of <I>ingenuous</I> and <I>servile</I> birth, which was decided by the
 condition of the mother; and the candor of the laws was
 satisfied, if her freedom could be ascertained, during a
 single moment, between the conception and the delivery. The
 slaves, who were liberated by a generous master, immediately
 entered into the middle class of <I>libertines</I> or freedmen; but
 they could never be enfranchised from the duties of
 obedience and gratitude; whatever were the fruits of their
 industry, their patron and his family inherited the third
 part; or even the whole of their fortune, if they died
 without children and without a testament. Justinian
 respected the rights of patrons; but his indulgence removed
 the badge of disgrace from the two inferior orders of
 freedmen; whoever ceased to be a slave, obtained, without
 reserve or delay, the station of a citizen; and at length
 the dignity of an ingenuous birth, which nature had refused,
 was created, or supposed, by the omnipotence of the emperor.
 Whatever restraints of age, or forms, or numbers, had been
 formerly introduced to check the abuse of manumissions, and
 the too rapid increase of vile and indigent Romans, he
 finally abolished; and the spirit of his laws promoted the
 extinction of domestic servitude. Yet the eastern provinces
 were filled, in the time of Justinian, with multitudes of
 slaves, either born or purchased for the use of their
 masters; and the price, from ten to seventy pieces of gold,
 was determined by their age, their strength, and their
 education. <small>(<a href="nt440/100.htm">100</a>)</small> But the hardships of this dependent state
 were continually diminished by the influence of government
 and religion: and the pride of a subject was no longer
 elated by his absolute dominion over the life and happiness
 of his bondsman. <small>(<a href="nt440/101.htm">101</a>)</small>

</p><p id="fathers"><small class="ok"><I>Fathers and children. </i></small><br>

 The law of nature instructs most animals to cherish and
 educate their infant progeny. The law of reason inculcates
 to the human species the returns of filial piety. But the
 exclusive, absolute, and perpetual dominion of the father
 over his children, is peculiar to the Roman jurisprudence,
 <small>(<a href="nt440/102.htm">102</a>)</small> and seems to be coeval with the foundation of the city.
 <small>(<a href="nt440/103.htm">103</a>)</small> The paternal power was instituted or confirmed by
 Romulus himself; and, after the practice of three centuries,
 it was inscribed on the fourth table of the Decemvirs. In
 the forum, the senate, or the camp, the adult son of a Roman
 citizen enjoyed the public and private rights of a <I>person</I>:
 in his father's house he was a mere <I>thing</I>; <!-- a HREF="nt440/LXX.htm" (L) --> confounded by
 the laws with the movables, the cattle, and the slaves, whom
 the capricious master might alienate or destroy, without
 being responsible to any earthly tribunal. The hand which
 bestowed the daily sustenance might resume the voluntary
 gift, and whatever was acquired by the labor or fortune of
 the son was immediately lost in the property of the father.
 His stolen goods (his oxen or his children) might be
 recovered by the same action of theft; <small>(<a href="nt440/104.htm">104</a>)</small> and if either
 had been guilty of a trespass, it was in his own option to
 compensate the damage, or resign to the injured party the
 obnoxious animal. At the call of indigence or avarice, the
 master of a family could dispose of his children or his
 slaves. But the condition of the slave was far more
 advantageous, since he regained, by the first manumission,
 his alienated freedom: the son was again restored to his
 unnatural father; he might be condemned to servitude a
 second and a third time, and it was not till after the third
 sale and deliverance, <small>(<a href="nt440/105.htm">105</a>)</small> that he was enfranchised from the
 domestic power which had been so repeatedly abused.
 According to his discretion, a father might chastise the
 real or imaginary faults of his children, by stripes, by
 imprisonment, by exile, by sending them to the country to
 work in chains among the meanest of his servants. The
 majesty of a parent was armed with the power of life and
 death; <small>(<a href="nt440/106.htm">106</a>)</small> and the examples of such bloody executions,
 which were sometimes praised and never punished, may be
 traced in the annals of Rome beyond the times of Pompey and
 Augustus. Neither age, nor rank, nor the consular office,
 nor the honors of a triumph, could exempt the most
 illustrious citizen from the bonds of filial subjection:
 <small>(<a href="nt440/107.htm">107</a>)</small> his own descendants were included in the family of
 their common ancestor; and the claims of adoption were not
 less sacred or less rigorous than those of nature. Without
 fear, though not without danger of abuse, the Roman
 legislators had reposed an unbounded confidence in the
 sentiments of paternal love; and the oppression was tempered
 by the assurance that each generation must succeed in its
 turn to the awful dignity of parent and master.

</p><p id="limitations"><small class="ok"><I>Limitations of the paternal authority. </i></small><br>

 The first limitation of paternal power is ascribed to the
 justice and humanity of Numa; and the maid who, with his
 father's consent, had espoused a freeman, was protected from
 the disgrace of becoming the wife of a slave. In the first
 ages, when the city was pressed, and often famished, by her
 Latin and Tuscan neighbors, the sale of children might be a
 frequent practice; but as a Roman could not legally purchase
 the liberty of his fellow-citizen, the market must gradually
 fail, and the trade would be destroyed by the conquests of
 the republic. An imperfect right of property was at length
 communicated to sons; and the threefold distinction of
 <I>profectitious, adventitious</I>, and <I>professional</I> was
 ascertained by the jurisprudence of the Code and Pandects.
 <small>(<a href="nt440/108.htm">108</a>)</small> Of all that proceeded from the father, he imparted only
 the use, and reserved the absolute dominion; yet if his
 goods were sold, the filial portion was excepted, by a
 favorable interpretation, from the demands of the creditors.
 In whatever accrued by marriage, gift, or collateral
 succession, the property was secured to the son; but the
 father, unless he had been specially excluded, enjoyed the
 usufruct during his life. As a just and prudent reward of
 military virtue, the spoils of the enemy were acquired,
 possessed, and bequeathed by the soldier alone; and the fair
 analogy was extended to the emoluments of any liberal
 profession, the salary of public service, and the sacred
 liberality of the emperor or empress. The life of a citizen
 was less exposed than his fortune to the abuse of paternal
 power. Yet his life might be adverse to the interest or
 passions of an unworthy father: the same crimes that flowed
 from the corruption, were more sensibly felt by the
 humanity, of the Augustan age; and the cruel Erixo, who
 whipped his son till he expired, was saved by the emperor
 from the just fury of the multitude. <small>(<a href="nt440/109.htm">109</a>)</small> The Roman father,
 from the license of servile dominion, was reduced to the
 gravity and moderation of a judge. The presence and opinion
 of Augustus confirmed the sentence of exile pronounced
 against an intentional parricide by the domestic tribunal of
 Arius. Adrian transported to an island the jealous parent,
 who, like a robber, had seized the opportunity of hunting,
 to assassinate a youth, the incestuous lover of his
 step-mother. <small>(<a href="nt440/110.htm">110</a>)</small> A private jurisdiction is repugnant to the
 spirit of monarchy; the parent was again reduced from a
 judge to an accuser; and the magistrates were enjoined by
 Severus Alexander to hear his complaints and execute his
 sentence. He could no longer take the life of a son without
 incurring the guilt and punishment of murder; and the pains
 of parricide, from which he had been excepted by the
 Pompeian law, were finally inflicted by the justice of
 Constantine. <small>(<a href="nt440/111.htm">111</a>)</small> The same protection was due to every
 period of existence; and reason must applaud the humanity of
 Paulus, for imputing the crime of murder to the father who
 strangles, or starves, or abandons his new-born infant; or
 exposes him in a public place to find the mercy which he
 himself had denied. But the exposition of children was the
 prevailing and stubborn vice of antiquity: it was sometimes
 prescribed, often permitted, almost always practised with
 impunity, by the nations who never entertained the Roman
 ideas of paternal power; and the dramatic poets, who appeal
 to the human heart, represent with indifference a popular
 custom which was palliated by the motives of economy and
 compassion. <small>(<a href="nt440/112.htm">112</a>)</small> If the father could subdue his own
 feelings, he might escape, though not the censure, at least
 the chastisement, of the laws; and the Roman empire was
 stained with the blood of infants, till such murders were
 included, by Valentinian and his colleagues, in the letter
 and spirit of the Cornelian law. The lessons of
 jurisprudence <small>(<a href="nt440/113.htm">113</a>)</small> and Christianity had been insufficient to
 eradicate this inhuman practice, till their gentle influence
 was fortified by the terrors of capital punishment. <small>(<a href="nt440/114.htm">114</a>)</small>

</p><p id="husbands"><small class="ok"><I>Husbands and wives. </i></small><br>

 Experience has proved, that savages are the tyrants of the
 female sex, and that the condition of women is usually
 softened by the refinements of social life. In the hope of
 a robust progeny, Lycurgus had delayed the season of
 marriage: it was fixed by Numa at the tender age of twelve
 years, that the Roman husband might educate to his will a
 pure and obedient virgin. <small>(<a href="nt440/115.htm">115</a>)</small> <sup id="marriage"><I>The religious rites of marriage</i></sup> According to the custom of antiquity, he bought his bride of her parents, and she fulfilled the <I>coemption</I> by purchasing, with three pieces of copper, a just introduction to his house and household
 deities. A sacrifice of fruits was offered by the pontiffs
 in the presence of ten witnesses; the contracting parties
 were seated on the same sheep-skin; they tasted a salt cake
 of <I>far</I> or rice; and this <I>confarreation</I>, <small>(<a href="nt440/116.htm">116</a>)</small> which denoted
 the ancient food of Italy, served as an emblem of their
 mystic union of mind and body. But this union on the side of
 the woman was rigorous and unequal; and she renounced the
 name and worship of her father's house, to embrace a new
 servitude, decorated only by the title of adoption, a
 fiction of the law, neither rational nor elegant, bestowed
 on the mother of a family <small>(<a href="nt440/117.htm">117</a>)</small> (her proper appellation) the
 strange characters of sister to her own children, and of
 daughter to her husband or master, who was invested with the
 plenitude of paternal power. By his judgment or caprice her
 behavior was approved, or censured, or chastised; he
 exercised the jurisdiction of life and death; and it was
 allowed, that in the cases of adultery or drunkenness, <small>(<a href="nt440/118.htm">118</a>)</small>
 the sentence might be properly inflicted. She acquired and
 inherited for the sole profit of her lord; and so clearly
 was woman defined, not as a <I>person</I>, but as a <I>thing</I>, that, if
 the original title were deficient, she might be claimed,
 like other movables, by the <I>use</I> and possession of an entire
 year. The inclination of the Roman husband discharged or
 withheld the conjugal debt, so scrupulously exacted by the
 Athenian and Jewish laws: <small>(<a href="nt440/119.htm">119</a>)</small> but as polygamy was unknown,
 he could never admit to his bed a fairer or a more favoured
 partner.

</p><p id="freedom"><small class="ok"><I>Freedom of the matrimonial contract. </i></small><br>

 After the Punic triumphs, the matrons of Rome aspired to the
 common benefits of a free and opulent republic: their wishes
 were gratified by the indulgence of fathers and lovers, and
 their ambition was unsuccessfully resisted by the gravity of
 Cato the Censor. <small>(<a href="nt440/120.htm">120</a>)</small> They declined the solemnities of the
 old nuptiais; defeated the annual prescription by an absence
 of three days; and, without losing their name or
 independence, subscribed the liberal and definite terms of a
 marriage contract. Of their private fortunes, they
 communicated the use, and secured the property: the estates
 of a wife could neither be alienated nor mortgaged by a
 prodigal husband; their mutual gifts were prohibited by the
 jealousy of the laws; and the misconduct of either party
 might afford, under another name, a future subject for an
 action of theft. To this loose and voluntary compact,
 religious and civil rights were no longer essential; and,
 between persons of a similar rank, the apparent community of
 life was allowed as sufficient evidence of their nuptials.
 The dignity of marriage was restored by the Christians, who
 derived all spiritual grace from the prayers of the faithful
 and the benediction of the priest or bishop. The origin,
 validity, and duties of the holy institution were regulated
 by the tradition of the synagogue, the precepts of the
 gospel, and the canons of general or provincial synods; <small>(<a href="nt440/121.htm">121</a>)</small>
 and the conscience of the Christians was awed by the decrees
 and censures of their ecclesiastical rulers. Yet the
 magistrates of Justinian were not subject to the authority
 of the church: the emperor consulted the unbelieving
 civilians of antiquity, and the choice of matrimonial laws
 in the Code and Pandects, is directed by the earthly motives
 of justice, policy, and the natural freedom of both sexes.
 <small>(<a href="nt440/122.htm">122</a>)</small>

</p><p id="liberty"><small class="ok"><I>Liberty and abuse of divorce. </i></small><br>

 Besides the agreement of the parties, the essence of every
 rational contract, the Roman marriage required the previous
 approbation of the parents. A father might be forced by some
 recent laws to supply the wants of a mature daughter; but
 even his insanity was not gradually allowed to supersede the
 necessity of his consent. The causes of the dissolution of
 matrimony have varied among the Romans; <small>(<a href="nt440/123.htm">123</a>)</small> but the most
 solemn sacrament, the confarreation itself, might always be
 done away by rites of a contrary tendency. In the first
 ages, the father of a family might sell his children, and
 his wife was reckoned in the number of his children: the
 domestic judge might pronounce the death of the offender, or
 his mercy might expel her from his bed and house; but the
 slavery of the wretched female was hopeless and perpetual,
 unless he asserted for his own convenience the manly
 prerogative of divorce. <!-- a HREF="nt440/MXX.htm" (M) --> The warmest applause has been
 lavished on the virtue of the Romans, who abstained from the
 exercise of this tempting privilege above five hundred
 years: <small>(<a href="nt440/124.htm">124</a>)</small> but the same fact evinces the unequal terms of a
 connection in which the slave was unable to renounce her
 tyrant, and the tyrant was unwilling to relinquish his
 slave. When the Roman matrons became the equal and
 voluntary companions of their lords, a new jurisprudence was
 introduced, that marriage, like other partnerships, might be
 dissolved by the abdication of one of the associates. In
 three centuries of prosperity and corruption, this principle
 was enlarged to frequent practice and pernicious abuse.
 Passion, interest, or caprice, suggested daily motives for
 the dissolution of marriage; a word, a sign, a message, a
 letter, the mandate of a freedman, declared the separation;
 the most tender of human connections was degraded to a
 transient society of profit or pleasure. According to the
 various conditions of life, both sexes alternately felt the
 disgrace and injury: an inconstant spouse transferred her
 wealth to a new family, abandoning a numerous, perhaps a
 spurious, progeny to the paternal authority and care of her
 late husband; a beautiful virgin might be dismissed to the
 world, old, indigent, and friendless; but the reluctance of
 the Romans, when they were pressed to marriage by Augustus,
 sufficiently marks, that the prevailing institutions were
 least favorable to the males. A specious theory is confuted
 by this free and perfect experiment, which demonstrates,
 that the liberty of divorce does not contribute to happiness
 and virtue. The facility of separation would destroy all
 mutual confidence, and inflame every trifling dispute: the
 minute difference between a husband and a stranger, which
 might so easily be removed, might still more easily be
 forgotten; and the matron, who in five years can submit to
 the embraces of eight husbands, must cease to reverence the
 chastity of her own person. <small>(<a href="nt440/125.htm">125</a>)</small>

</p><p id="divorce"><small class="ok"><I>Limitations of the liberty of divorce. </i></small><br>

 Insufficient remedies followed with distant and tardy steps
 the rapid progress of the evil. The ancient worship of the
 Romans afforded a peculiar goddess to hear and reconcile the
 complaints of a married life; but her epithet of <I>Viriplaca</I>,
 <small>(<a href="nt440/126.htm">126</a>)</small> the appeaser of husbands, too clearly indicates on
 which side submission and repentance were always expected.
 Every act of a citizen was subject to the judgment of the
 <I>censors</I>; the first who used the privilege of divorce
 assigned, at their command, the motives of his conduct; <small>(<a href="nt440/127.htm">127</a>)</small>
 and a senator was expelled for dismissing his virgin spouse
 without the knowledge or advice of his friends. Whenever an
 action was instituted for the recovery of a marriage
 portion, the <I>praetor</I>, as the guardian of equity, examined
 the cause and the characters, and gently inclined the scale
 in favor of the guiltless and injured party. Augustus, who
 united the powers of both magistrates, adopted their
 different modes of repressing or chastising the license of
 divorce. <small>(<a href="nt440/128.htm">128</a>)</small> The presence of seven Roman witnesses was
 required for the validity of this solemn and deliberate act:
 if any adequate provocation had been given by the husband,
 instead of the delay of two years, he was compelled to
 refund immediately, or in the space of six months; but if he
 could arraign the manners of his wife, her guilt or levity
 was expiated by the loss of the sixth or eighth part of her
 marriage portion. The Christian princes were the first who
 specified the just causes of a private divorce; their
 institutions, from Constantine to Justinian, appear to
 fluctuate between the custom of the empire and the wishes of
 the church, <small>(<a href="nt440/129.htm">129</a>)</small> and the author of the Novels too frequently
 reforms the jurisprudence of the Code and Pandects. In the
 most rigorous laws, a wife was condemned to support a
 gamester, a drunkard, or a libertine, unless he were guilty
 of homicide, poison, or sacrilege, in which cases the
 marriage, as it should seem, might have been dissolved by
 the hand of the executioner. But the sacred right of the
 husband was invariably maintained, to deliver his name and
 family from the disgrace of adultery: the list of mortal
 sins, either male or female, was curtailed and enlarged by
 successive regulations, and the obstacles of incurable
 impotence, long absence, and monastic profession, were
 allowed to rescind the matrimonial obligation. Whoever
 transgressed the permission of the law, was subject to
 various and heavy penalties. The woman was stripped of her
 wealth and ornaments, without excepting the bodkin of her
 hair: if the man introduced a new bride into his bed, <I>her</I>
 fortune might be lawfully seized by the vengeance of his
 exiled wife. Forfeiture was sometimes commuted to a fine;
 the fine was sometimes aggravated by transportation to an
 island, or imprisonment in a monastery; the injured party
 was released from the bonds of marriage; but the offender,
 during life, or a term of years, was disabled from the
 repetition of nuptials. The successor of Justinian yielded
 to the prayers of his unhappy subjects, and restored the
 liberty of divorce by mutual consent: the civilians were
 unanimous, <small>(<a href="nt440/130.htm">130</a>)</small> the theologians were divided, <small>(<a href="nt440/131.htm">131</a>)</small> and the
 ambiguous word, which contains the precept of Christ, is
 flexible to any interpretation that the wisdom of a
 legislator can demand.

</p><p id="incest"><small class="ok"><I>Incest, concubines and bastards. </i></small><br>

 The freedom of love and marriage was restrained among the
 Romans by natural and civil impediments. An instinct,
 almost innate and universal, appears to prohibit the
 incestuous commerce <small>(<a href="nt440/132.htm">132</a>)</small> of parents and children in the
 infinite series of ascending and descending generations.
 Concerning the oblique and collateral branches, nature is
 indifferent, reason mute, and custom various and arbitrary.
 In Egypt, the marriage of brothers and sisters was admitted
 without scruple or exception: a Spartan might espouse the
 daughter of his father, an Athenian, that of his mother; and
 the nuptials of an uncle with his niece were applauded at
 Athens as a happy union of the dearest relations. The
 profane lawgivers of Rome were never tempted by interest or
 superstition to multiply the forbidden degrees: but they
 inflexibly condemned the marriage of sisters and brothers,
 hesitated whether first cousins should be touched by the
 same interdict; revered the parental character of aunts and
 uncles, <!-- a HREF="nt440/NXX.htm" (N) --> and treated affinity and adoption as a just
 imitation of the ties of blood. According to the proud
 maxims of the republic, a legal marriage could only be
 contracted by free citizens; an honorable, at least an
 ingenuous birth, was required for the spouse of a senator:
 but the blood of kings could never mingle in legitimate
 nuptials with the blood of a Roman; and the name of Stranger
 degraded Cleopatra and Berenice, <small>(<a href="nt440/133.htm">133</a>)</small> to live the <I>concubines</I> of Mark Antony and Titus. <small>(<a href="nt440/134.htm">134</a>)</small> This appellation, indeed, so
 injurious to the majesty, cannot without indulgence be
 applied to the manners, of these Oriental queens. A
 concubine, in the strict sense of the civilians, was a woman
 of servile or plebeian extraction, the sole and faithful
 companion of a Roman citizen, who continued in a state of
 celibacy. Her modest station, below the honors of a wife,
 above the infamy of a prostitute, was acknowledged and
 approved by the laws: from the age of Augustus to the tenth
 century, the use of this secondary marriage prevailed both
 in the West and East; and the humble virtues of a concubine
 were often preferred to the pomp and insolence of a noble
 matron. In this connection, the two Antonines, the best of
 princes and of men, enjoyed the comforts of domestic love:
 the example was imitated by many citizens impatient of
 celibacy, but regardful of their families. If at any time
 they desired to legitimate their natural children, the
 conversion was instantly performed by the celebration of
 their nuptials with a partner whose faithfulness and
 fidelity they had already tried. <!-- a HREF="nt440/OXX.htm" (O) --> By this epithet of
 <I>natural</I>, the offspring of the concubine were distinguished
 from the spurious brood of adultery, prostitution, and
 incest, to whom Justinian reluctantly grants the necessary
 aliments of life; and these natural children alone were
 capable of succeeding to a sixth part of the inheritance of
 their reputed father. According to the rigor of law,
 bastards were entitled only to the name and condition of
 their mother, from whom they might derive the character of a
 slave, a stranger, or a citizen. The outcasts of every
 family were adopted without reproach as the children of the
 state. <small>(<a href="nt440/135.htm">135</a>)</small> <!-- a HREF="NT440/PXX.HTM" (P) -->

</p><p id="guardians"><small class="ok"><I>Guardians and wards. </i></small><br>

 The relation of guardian and ward, or in Roman words of
 tutor and pupil, which covers so many titles of the
 Institutes and Pandects, <small>(<a href="nt440/136.htm">136</a>)</small> is of a very simple and
 uniform nature. The person and property of an orphan must
 always be trusted to the custody of some discreet friend.
 If the deceased father had not signified his choice, the
 agnats, or paternal kindred of the nearest degree, were
 compelled to act as the natural guardians: the Athenians
 were apprehensive of exposing the infant to the power of
 those most interested in his death; but an axiom of Roman
 jurisprudence has pronounced, that the charge of tutelage
 should constantly attend the emolument of succession. If
 the choice of the father, and the line of consanguinity,
 afforded no efficient guardian, the failure was supplied by
 the nomination of the praetor of the city, or the president
 of the province. But the person whom they named to this
 <I>public</I> office might be legally excused by insanity or
 blindness, by ignorance or inability, by previous enmity or
 adverse interest, by the number of children or guardianships
 with which he was already burdened, and by the immunities
 which were granted to the useful labors of magistrates,
 lawyers, physicians, and professors. Till the infant could
 speak, and think, he was represented by the tutor, whose
 authority was finally determined by the age of puberty.
 Without his consent, no act of the pupil could bind himself
 to his own prejudice, though it might oblige others for his
 personal benefit. It is needless to observe, that the tutor
 often gave security, and always rendered an account, and
 that the want of diligence or integrity exposed him to a
 civil and almost criminal action for the violation of his
 sacred trust. The age of puberty had been rashly fixed by
 the civilians at fourteen; <!-- a HREF="nt440/QXX.htm" (Q) --> but as the faculities of the
 mind ripen more slowly than those of the body, a <I>curator</I> was
 interposed to guard the fortunes of a Roman youth from his
 own inexperience and headstrong passions. Such a trustee
 had been first instituted by the praetor, to save a family
 from the blind havoc of a prodigal or madman; and the minor
 was compelled, by the laws, to solicit the same protection,
 to give validity to his acts till he accomplished the full
 period of twenty-five years. Women were condemned to the
 perpetual tutelage of parents, husbands, or guardians; a sex
 created to please and obey was never supposed to have
 attained the age of reason and experience. Such, at least,
 was the stern and haughty spirit of the ancient law, which
 had been insensibly mollified before the time of Justinian.

<small class="ok"><I> Right of property.</i></small><br>

 The original right of property can only be justified by
 the accident or merit of prior occupancy; and on this
 foundation it is wisely established by the philosophy of the
 civilians. <small>(<a href="nt440/137.htm">137</a>)</small> The savage who hollows a tree, inserts a sharp stone into a wooden handle, or applies a string to an elastic branch, becomes in a state of nature the just
 proprietor of the canoe, the bow, or the hatchet. The
 materials were common to all, the new form, the produce of
 his time and simple industry, belongs solely to himself. His
 hungry brethren cannot, without a sense of their own
 injustice, extort from the hunter the game of the forest
 overtaken or slain by his personal strength and dexterity.
 If his provident care preserves and multiplies the tame
 animals, whose nature is tractable to the arts of education,
 he acquires a perpetual title to the use and service of
 their numerous progeny, which derives its existence from him
 alone. If he encloses and cultivates a field for their
 sustenance and his own, a barren waste is converted into a
 fertile soil; the seed, the manure, the labor, create a new
 value, and the rewards of harvest are painfully earned by
 the fatigues of the revolving year. In the successive
 states of society, the hunter, the shepherd, the husbandman,
 may defend their possessions by two reasons which forcibly
 appeal to the feelings of the human mind: that whatever they
 enjoy is the fruit of their own industry; and that every man
 who envies their felicity, may purchase similar acquisitions
 by the exercise of similar diligence. Such, in truth, may
 be the freedom and plenty of a small colony cast on a
 fruitful island. But the colony multiplies, while the space
 still continues the same; the common rights, the equal
 inheritance of mankind. are engrossed by the bold and
 crafty; each field and forest is circumscribed by the
 landmarks of a jealous master; and it is the peculiar praise
 of the Roman jurisprudence, that i asserts the claim of the
 first occupant to the wild animals of the earth, the air,
 and the waters. In the progress from primitive equity to
 final injustice, the steps are silent, the shades are almost
 imperceptible, and the absolute monopoly is guarded by
 positive laws and artificial reason. The active, insatiate
 principle of self-love can alone supply the arts of life and
 the wages of industry; and as soon as civil government and
 exclusive property have been introduced, they become
 necessary to the existence of the human race. Except in the
 singular institutions of Sparta, the wisest legislators have
 disapproved an agrarian law as a false and dangerous
 innovation. Among the Romans, the enormous disproportion of
 wealth surmounted the ideal restraints of a doubtful
 tradition, and an obsolete statute; a tradition that the
 poorest follower of Romulus had been endowed with the
 perpetual inheritance of two <I>jugera</I>; <small>(<a href="nt440/138.htm">138</a>)</small> a statute which
 confined the richest citizen to the measure of five hundred
 jugera, or three hundred and twelve acres of land. The
 original territory of Rome consisted only of some miles of
 wood and meadow along the banks of the Tyber; and domestic
 exchange could add nothing to the national stock. But the
 goods of an alien or enemy were lawfully exposed to the
 first hostile occupier; the city was enriched by the
 profitable trade of war; and the blood of her sons was the
 only price that was paid for the Volscian sheep, the slaves
 of Briton, or the gems and gold of Asiatic kingdoms. In the
 language of ancient jurisprudence, which was corrupted and
 forgotten before the age of Justinian, these spoils were
 distinguished by the name of <I>manceps</I> or <I>manicipium</I>, taken
 with the hand; and whenever they were sold or <I>emancipated</I>,
 the purchaser required some assurance that they had been the
 property of an enemy, and not of a fellow- citizen. <small>(<a href="nt440/139.htm">139</a>)</small> A
 citizen could only forfeit his rights by apparent
 dereliction, and such dereliction of a valuable interest
 could not easily be presumed. Yet, according to the Twelve
 Tables, a prescription of one year for movables, and of two
 years for immovables, abolished the claim of the ancient
 master, if the actual possessor had acquired them by a fair
 transaction from the person whom he believed to be the
 lawful proprietor. <small>(<a href="nt440/140.htm">140</a>)</small> Such conscientious injustice,
 without any mixture of fraud or force could seldom injure
 the members of a small republic; but the various periods of
 three, of ten, or of twenty years, determined by Justinian,
 are more suitable to the latitude of a great empire. It is
 only in the term of prescription that the distinction of
 real and personal fortune has been remarked by the
 civilians; and their general idea of property is that of
 simple, uniform, and absolute dominion. The subordinate
 exceptions of <I>use</I>, of <I> usufruct</I>, <small>(<a href="nt440/141.htm">141</a>)</small> of <I>servitude</I>, <small>(<a href="nt440/142.htm">142</a>)</small>
 imposed for the benefit of a neighbour on lands and houses,
 are abundantly explained by the professors of jurisprudence.
 The claims of property, as far as they are altered by the
 mixture, the division, or the transformation of substances,
 are investigated with metaphysical subtilty by the same
 civilians.

</p><p id="inheritance"> <small class="ok"><I>Of inheritance and succession. </i></small><br>

 The personal title of the first proprietor must be
 determined by his death: but the possession, without any
 appearance of change, is peaceably continued in his
 children, the associates of his toil, and the partners of
 his wealth. This natural inheritance has been protected by
 the legislators of every climate and age, and the father is
 encouraged to persevere in slow and distant improvements, by
 the tender hope, that a long posterity will enjoy the fruits
 of his labor. The <I>principle</I> of hereditary succession is
 universal; but the <I>order</I> has been variously established by
 convenience or caprice, by the spirit of national
 institutions, or by some partial example which was
 originally decided by fraud or violence. The jurisprudence
 of the Romans appear to have deviated from the inequality of
 nature much less than the Jewish, <small>(<a href="nt440/143.htm">143</a>)</small> the Athenian, <small>(<a href="nt440/144.htm">144</a>)</small> or
 the English institutions. <small>(<a href="nt440/145.htm">145</a>)</small> On the death of a citizen,
 all his descendants, unless they were already freed from his
 paternal power, were called to the inheritance of his
 possessions. The insolent prerogative of primogeniture was
 unknown; the two sexes were placed on a just level; all the
 sons and daughters were entitled to an equal portion of the
 patrimonial estate; and if any of the sons had been
 intercepted by a premature death, <sup id="kindred"> <I> Civil degrees of kindred. </i></sup>  his person was represented, and his share was divided, by his surviving children. On the failure of the direct line, the right of succession must diverge to the collateral branches. The
 degrees of kindred <small>(<a href="nt440/146.htm">146</a>)</small> are numbered by the civilians, ascending from the last possessor to a common parent, and descending from the common parent to the next heir: my father stands in the first degree, my brother in the second, his children in the third, and the remainder of the series may be conceived by a fancy, or pictured in a genealogical table. In this computation, a distinction was made,
 essential to the laws and even the constitution of Rome; the <I>agnats</I>, or persons connected by a line of males, were called, as they stood in the nearest degree, to an equal partition; but a female was incapable of transmitting any legal claims; and the <I>cognats</I> of every rank, without
 excepting the dear relation of a mother and a son, were disinherited by the Twelve Tables, as strangers and aliens. Among the Romans a <I>gens</I> or lineage was united by a common <I>name</I> and domestic rites; the various <I>cognomens</I> or <I>surnames</I> of Scipio, or Marcellus, distinguished from each other the subordinate branches or families of the Cornelian or
 Claudian race: the default of the <I> agnats</I>, of the same surname, was supplied by the larger denomination of <I>gentiles</I>; and the vigilance of the laws maintained, in the same name, the perpetual descent of religion and property. A similar principle dictated the Voconian law, <small>(<a href="nt440/147.htm">147</a>)</small> which abolished the right of female inheritance. As long as virgins were given or sold in marriage, the adoption of the wife extinguished the hopes of the daughter. But the equal succession of independent matrons supported their pride and luxury, and might transport into a foreign house the riches of their fathers. While the maxims of Cato <small>(<a href="nt440/148.htm">148</a>)</small> were revered, they tended to perpetuate in each family a just and virtuous mediocrity: till female blandishments insensibly triumphed; and every salutary restraint was lost in the dissolute greatness of the republic. The rigor of the decemvirs was tempered by the equity of the praetors. Their edicts restored and emancipated posthumous children to the rights of nature; and upon the failure of the <I>agnats</I>, they
 preferred the blood of the <I>cognats</I> to the name of the
 gentiles whose title and character were insensibly covered
 with oblivion. The reciprocal inheritance of mothers and
 sons was established in the Tertullian and Orphitian decrees
 by the humanity of the senate. A new and more impartial
 order was introduced by the Novels of Justinian, who
 affected to revive the jurisprudence of the Twelve Tables.
 The lines of masculine and female kindred were confounded:
 the descending, ascending, and collateral series was
 accurately defined; and each degree, according tot he
 proximity of blood and affection, succeeded to the vacant
 possessions of a Roman citizen. <small>(<a href="nt440/149.htm">149</a>)</small>

</p><p id="testaments"> <small class="ok"><I>Introduction and liberty of testaments. </i></small><br>

 The order of succession is regulated by nature, or at least
 by the general and permanent reason of the lawgiver: but
 this order is frequently violated by the arbitrary and
 partial wills, which prolong the dominion of the testator
 beyond the grave. <small>(<a href="nt440/150.htm">150</a>)</small> In the simple state of society, this
 last use or abuse of the right of property is seldom
 indulged: it was introduced at Athens by the laws of Solon;
 and the private testaments of the father of a family are
 authorized by the Twelve Tables. Before the time of the
 decemvirs, <small>(<a href="nt440/151.htm">151</a>)</small> a Roman citizen exposed his wishes and
 motives to the assembly of the thirty curiae or parishes,
 and the general law of inheritance was suspended by an
 occasional act of the legislature. After the permission of
 the decemvirs, each private lawgiver promulgated his verbal
 or written testament in the presence of five citizens, who
 represented the five classes of the Roman people; a sixth
 witness attested their concurrence; a seventh weighed the
 copper money, which was paid by an imaginary purchaser; and
 the estate was emancipated by a fictitious sale and
 immediate release. This singular ceremony, <small>(<a href="nt440/152.htm">152</a>)</small> which
 excited the wonder of the Greeks, was still practised in the
 age of Severus; but the praetors had already approved a more
 simple testament, for which they required the seals and
 signatures of seven witnesses, free from all legal
 exception, and purposely summoned for the execution of that
 important act. A domestic monarch, who reigned over the
 lives and fortunes of his children, might distribute their
 respective shares according to the degrees of their merit or
 his affection; his arbitrary displeasure chastised an
 unworthy son by the loss of his inheritance, and the
 mortifying preference of a stranger. But the experience of
 unnatural parents recommended some limitations of their
 testamentary powers. A son, or, by the laws of Justinian,
 even a daughter, could no longer be disinherited by their
 silence: they were compelled to name the criminal, and to
 specify the offence; and the justice of the emperor
 enumerated the sole causes that could justify such a
 violation of the first principles of nature and society.
 <small>(<a href="nt440/153.htm">153</a>)</small> Unless a legitimate portion, a fourth part, had been
 reserved for the children, they were entitled to institute
 an action or complaint of <I>inofficious</I> testament; to suppose
 that their father's understanding was impaired by sickness
 or age; and respectfully to appeal from his rigorous
 sentence to the deliberate wisdom of the magistrate. <sup id="legacies"><I> Legacies</i></sup>  In the Roman jurisprudence, an essential distinction was admitted between the inheritance and the legacies. The heirs who succeeded to the entire unity, or to any of the twelve
 fractions of the substance of the testator, represented his
 civil and religious character, asserted his rights,
 fulfilled his obligations, and discharged the gifts of
 friendship or liberality, which his last will had bequeathed
 under the name of legacies. But as the imprudence or
 prodigality of a dying man might exhaust the inheritance,
 and leave only risk and labor to his successor, he was
 empowered to retain the <I>Falcidian</I> portion; to deduct, before
 the payment of the legacies, a clear fourth for his own
 emolument. A reasonable time was allowed to examine the
 proportion between the debts and the estate, to decide
 whether he should accept or refuse the testament; and if he
 used the benefit of an inventory, the demands of the
 creditors could not exceed the valuation of the effects.
 The last will of a citizen might be altered during his life,
 or rescinded after his death: the persons whom he named
 might die before him, or reject the inheritance, or be
 exposed to some legal disqualification. In the
 contemplation of these events, he was permitted to
 substitute second and third heirs, to replace each other
 according to the order of the testament; and the incapacity
 of a madman or an infant to bequeath his property might be
 supplied by a similar substitution. <small>(<a href="nt440/154.htm">154</a>)</small> But the power of
 the testator expired with the acceptance of the testament:
 each Roman of mature age and discretion acquired the
 absolute dominion of his inheritance, and the simplicity of
 the civil law was never clouded by the long and intricate
 entails which confine the happiness and freedom of unborn
 generations.

</p><p id="codicils"> <small class="ok"><I>Codicils and trusts. </i></small><br>

 Conquest and the formalities of law established the use of
 <I> codicils</I>. If a Roman was surprised by death in a remote
 province of the empire, he addressed a short epistle to his
 legitimate or testamentary heir; who fulfilled with honor,
 or neglected with impunity, this last request, which the
 judges before the age of Augustus were not authorized to
 enforce. A codicil might be expressed in any mode, or in
 any language; but the subscription of five witnesses must
 declare that it was the genuine composition of the author.
 His intention, however laudable, was sometimes illegal; and
 the invention of <I>fidei-commissa</I>, or trusts, arose form the
 struggle between natural justice and positive jurisprudence.
 A stranger of Greece or Africa might be the friend or
 benefactor of a childless Roman, but none, except a
 fellow-citizen, could act as his heir. The Voconian law,
 which abolished female succession, restrained the legacy or
 inheritance of a woman to the sum of one hundred thousand
 sesterces; <small>(<a href="nt440/155.htm">155</a>)</small> and an only daughter was condemned almost as an alien in her father's house. The zeal of friendship, and
 parental affection, suggested a liberal artifice: a
 qualified citizen was named in the testament, with a prayer
 or injunction that he would restore the inheritance to the
 person for whom it was truly intended. Various was the
 conduct of the trustees in this painful situation: they had
 sworn to observe the laws of their country, but honor
 prompted them to violate their oath; and if they preferred
 their interest under the mask of patriotism, they forfeited
 the esteem of every virtuous mind. The declaration of
 Augustus relieved their doubts, gave a legal sanction to
 confidential testaments and codicils, and gently unravelled
 the forms and restraints of the republican jurisprudence.
 <small>(<a href="nt440/156.htm">156</a>)</small> But as the new practice of trusts degenerated into some
 abuse, the trustee was enabled, by the Trebellian and
 Pegasian decrees, to reserve one fourth of the estate, or to transfer on the head of the real heir all the debts and actions of the succession. The interpretation of testaments was strict and literal; but the language of <I>trusts</I> and codicils was delivered from the minute and technical
 accuracy of the civilians. <small>(<a href="nt440/157.htm">157</a>)</small>

</p><p id="ofactions"><b style="background:yellow">3 Of Actions<br>
The general duties of mankind are imposed by their public and private relations: but their specific <I>obligations</I> to each other can only be the effect of, 1. a promise, 2. a benefit, or 3. an injury: and when these obligations are ratified by law, the interested party may compel the performance by a judicial action. On this principle, the civilians of every country have erected a similar jurisprudence, the fair conclusion of universal reason and justice. <small>(<a href="nt440/158.htm">158</a>)</small>

</p><p id="promises"> <small class="ok"><I>Promises. </i></small><br>

 1. The goddess of <I>faith</I> (of human and social faith) was
 worshipped, not only in her temples, but in the lives of the Romans; and if that nation was deficient in the more amiable qualities of benevolence and generosity, they astonished the Greeks by their sincere and simple performance of the most burdensome engagements. <small>(<a href="nt440/159.htm">159</a>)</small> Yet among the same people, according to the rigid maxims of the patricians and decemvirs, a <I>naked pact</I>, a promise, or even an oath, did not create any civil obligation, unless it was confirmed by the legal form of a <I>stipulation</I>. Whatever might be the
 etymology of the Latin word, it conveyed the idea of a firm and irrevocable contract, which was always expressed in the mode of a question and answer. Do you promise to pay me one hundred pieces of gold? was the solemn interrogation of Seius. I do promise, was the reply of Sempronius. The
 friends of Sempronius, who answered for his ability and inclination, might be separately sued at the option of
 Seius; and the benefit of partition, or order of reciprocal
 actions, insensibly deviated from the strict theory of
 stipulation. The most cautious and deliberate consent was
 justly required to sustain the validity of a gratuitous
 promise; and the citizen who might have obtained a legal
 security, incurred the suspicion of fraud, and paid the
 forfeit of his neglect. But the ingenuity of the civilians
 successfully labored to convert simple engagements into the
 form of solemn stipulations. The praetors, as the guardians
 of social faith, admitted every rational evidence of a
 voluntary and deliberate act, which in their tribunal
 produced an equitable obligation, and for which they gave an
 action and a remedy. <small>(<a href="nt440/160.htm">160</a>)</small>

</p><p id="benefits"> <small class="ok"><i> Benefits</i></small><br>

2. The obligations of the second class, as they were
 contracted by the delivery of a thing, are marked by the
 civilians with the epithet of real. <small>(<a href="nt440/161.htm">161</a>)</small> A grateful return
 is due to the author of a benefit; and whoever is intrusted
 with the property of another, has bound himself to the
 sacred duty of restitution. In the case of a friendly loan,
 the merit of generosity is on the side of the lender only;
 in a deposit, on the side of the receiver; but in a <I>pledge</I>,
 and the rest of the selfish commerce of ordinary life, the
 benefit is compensated by an equivalent, and the obligation
 to restore is variously modified by the nature of the
 transaction. The Latin language very happily expresses the
 fundamental difference between the <I>commodatum</I> and the
 <I>mutuum</I>, which our poverty is reduced to confound under the
 vague and common appellation of a loan. In the former, the
 borrower was obliged to restore the same individual thing
 with which he had been <I>accommodated</I> for the temporary supply
 of his wants; in the latter, it was destined for his use and
 consumption, and he discharged this <I>mutual</I> engagement, by
 substituting the same specific value according to a just
 estimation of number, of weight, and of measure. In the
 contract of <I>sale</I>, the absolute dominion is transferred to
 the purchaser, and he repays the benefit with an adequate
 sum of gold or silver, the price and universal standard of
 all earthly possessions. The obligation of another
 contract, that of <I> location</I>, is of a more complicated kind.
 Lands or houses, labor or talents, may be hired for a
 definite term; at the expiration of the time, the thing
 itself must be restored to the owner, with an additional
 reward for the beneficial occupation and employment. In
 these lucrative contracts, to which may be added those of
 partnership and commissions, the civilians sometimes imagine
 the delivery of the object, and sometimes presume the
 consent of the parties. The substantial pledge has been
 refined into the invisible rights of a mortgage or
 <I>hypotheca</I>; and the agreement of sale, for a certain price,
 imputes, from that moment, the chances of gain or loss to
 the account of the purchaser. It may be fairly supposed,
 that every man will obey the dictates of his interest; and
 if he accepts the benefit, he is obliged to sustain the
 expense, of the transaction. In this boundless subject, the
 historian will observe the location of land and money, the
 rent of the one and the interest of the other, as they
 materially affect the prosperity of agriculture and
 commerce. The landlord was often obliged to advance the
 stock and instruments of husbandry, and to content himself
 with a partition of the fruits. If the feeble tenant was
 oppressed by accident, contagion, or hostile violence, he
 claimed a proportionable relief from the equity of the laws:
 five years were the customary term, and no solid or costly
 improvements could be expected from a farmer, who, at each
 moment might be ejected by the sale of the estate. <small>(<a href="nt440/162.htm">162</a>)</small> Usury, <small>(<a href="nt440/163.htm">163</a>)</small> <sup id="interest"><I>Interest of money. </i></sup> the inveterate grievance of the city, had been  discouraged by the Twelve Tables, <small>(<a href="nt440/164.htm">164</a>)</small> and abolished by the
 clamors of the people. It was revived by their wants and
 idleness, tolerated by the discretion of the praetors, and
 finally determined by the Code of Justinian. Persons of
 illustrious rank were confined to the moderate profit of
 four <I>per cent</I>.; six was pronounced to be the ordinary and
 legal standard of interest; eight was allowed for the
 convenience of manufactures and merchants; twelve was
 granted to nautical insurance, which the wiser ancients had
 not attempted to define; but, except in this perilous
 adventure, the practice of exorbitant usury was severely
 restrained. <small>(<a href="nt440/165.htm">165</a>)</small> The most simple interest was condemned by the clergy of the East and West; <small>(<a href="nt440/166.htm">166</a>)</small> but the sense of
 mutual benefit, which had triumphed over the law of the
 republic, has resisted with equal firmness the decrees of
 the church, and even the prejudices of mankind. <small>(<a href="nt440/167.htm">167</a>)</small>

</p><p id="injuries"> <small class="ok"><i> Injuries </i></small><br>

3. Nature and society impose the strict obligation of
 repairing an injury; and the sufferer by private injustice
 acquires a personal right and a legitimate action. If the
 property of another be intrusted to our care, the requisite
 degree of care may rise and fall according to the benefit
 which we derive from such temporary possession; we are
 seldom made responsible for inevitable accident, but the
 consequences of a voluntary fault must always be imputed to
 the author. <small>(<a href="nt440/168.htm">168</a>)</small> A Roman pursued and recovered his stolen goods by a civil action of theft; they might pass through a succession of pure and innocent hands, but nothing less than
 a prescription of thirty years could extinguish his original
 claim. They were restored by the sentence of the praetor,
 and the injury was compensated by double, or threefold, or
 even quadruple damages, as the deed had been perpetrated by
 secret fraud or open rapine, as the robber had been
 surprised in the fact, or detected by a subsequent research.
 The Aquilian law <small>(<a href="nt440/169.htm">169</a>)</small> defended the living property of a
 citizen, his slaves and cattle, from the stroke of malice or
 negligence: the highest price was allowed that could be
 ascribed to the domestic animal at any moment of the year
 preceding his death; a similar latitude of thirty days was
 granted on the destruction of any other valuable effects. A
 personal injury is blunted or sharpened by the manners of
 the times and the sensibility of the individual: the pain or
 the disgrace of a word or blow cannot easily be appreciated
 by a pecuniary equivalent. The rude jurisprudence of the
 decemvirs had confounded all hasty insults, which did not
 amount to the fracture of a limb, by condemning the
 aggressor to the common penalty of twenty-five asses. But
 the same denomination of money was reduced, in three
 centuries, from a pound to the weight of half an ounce: and
 the insolence of a wealthy Roman indulged himself in the
 cheap amusement of breaking and satisfying the law of the
 twelve tables. Veratius ran through the streets striking on
 the face the inoffensive passengers, and his attendant
 purse-bearer immediately silenced their clamors by the legal
 tender of twenty-five pieces of copper, about the value of
 one shilling. <small>(<a href="nt440/170.htm">170</a>)</small> The equity of the praetors examined and
 estimated the distinct merits of each particular complaint.
 In the adjudication of civil damages, the magistrate assumed
 a right to consider the various circumstances of time and
 place, of age and dignity, which may aggravate the shame and
 sufferings of the injured person; but if he admitted the
 idea of a fine, a punishment, an example, he invaded the
 province, though, perhaps, he supplied the defects, of the
 criminal law.

</p><p id="ofcrimes"><b style="background:yellow">4 Of Crimes And Punishments<br>
 The execution of the Alban dictator, who was dismembered by
 eight horses, is represented by Livy as the first and the
 fast instance of Roman cruelty in the punishment of the most
 atrocious crimes. <small>(<a href="nt440/171.htm">171</a>)</small> But this act of justice, or revenge, was inflicted on a foreign enemy in the heat of victory, and at the command of a single man. <sup id="severity"> <I>Severity of the twelve tables. </i></sup> The Twelve Tables afford a
 more decisive proof of the national spirit, since they were
 framed by the wisest of the senate, and accepted by the free
 voices of the people; yet these laws, like the statutes of
 Draco, <small>(<a href="nt440/172.htm">172</a>)</small> are written in characters of blood. <small>(<a href="nt440/173.htm">173</a>)</small> They
 approve the inhuman and unequal principle of retaliation;
 and the forfeit of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a
 limb for a limb, is rigorously exacted, unless the offender
 can redeem his pardon by a fine of three hundred pounds of
 copper. The decemvirs distributed with much liberality the
 slighter chastisements of flagellation and servitude; and
 nine crimes of a very different complexion are adjudged
 worthy of death.</p>

<p class="offset">1. Any act of <I>treason</I> against the state, or of
 correspondence with the public enemy. The mode of execution
 was painful and ignominious: the head of the degenerate
 Roman was shrouded in a veil, his hands were tied behind his
 back, and after he had been scourged by the lictor, he was
 suspended in the midst of the forum on a cross, or
 inauspicious tree.</p>
<p class="offset">2. Nocturnal meetings in the city; whatever might be the pretence, of pleasure, or religion, or the public good. </p>
 <p class="offset">3. The murder of a citizen; for which the common feelings of  mankind demand the blood of the murderer. Poison is still
 more odious than the sword or dagger; and we are surprised
 to discover, in two flagitious events, how early such subtle
 wickedness had infected the simplicity of the republic, and
 the chaste virtues of the Roman matrons. <small>(<a href="nt440/174.htm">174</a>)</small> The parricide,
 who violated the duties of nature and gratitude, was cast
 into the river or the sea, enclosed in a sack; and a cock, a

 most suitable companions. <small>(<a href="nt440/175.htm">175</a>)</small> Italy produces no monkeys;  but the want could never be felt, till the middle of the
 sixth century first revealed the guilt of a parricide. <small>(<a href="nt440/176.htm">176</a>)</small></p>

<p class="offset">4. The malice of an <I>incendiary</I>. After the previous ceremony of whipping, he himself was delivered to the flames; and in this example alone our reason is tempted to applaud the justice of retaliation.

<p class="offset">5. <I>Judicial perjury</I>. The corrupt or malicious witness was thrown headlong from the Tarpeian rock, to expiate his falsehood, which was rendered still more fatal by the severity of the penal laws, and the deficiency of written evidence. </p>
<p class="offset">6. The corruption of a judge, who accepted bribes to pronounce an iniquitous sentence. </p>
<p class="offset">7. Libels and satires, whose rude strains sometimes disturbed the peace of an illiterate city. The author was beaten with clubs, a worthy chastisement, but it is not certain that he was left to expire under the blows of the executioner. <small>(<a href="nt440/177.htm">177</a>)</small></p>
<p class="offset">8. The nocturnal mischief of damaging or destroying a neighbour's corn. The criminal was suspended as a grateful victim to Ceres. But the sylvan deities were less implacable, and the extirpation of a more valuable tree was compensated by the moderate fine of twenty-five pounds of copper. </p>

<p class="offset">9. Magical incantations; which had power, in the opinion of the Latin shepherds, to exhaust the strength of an enemy, to extinguish his life, and to remove from their seats his deep-rooted plantations. </p>

 still remains to be told; and I shall dare to prefer the
 literal sense of antiquity to the specious refinements of
 modern criticism. <small>(<a href="nt440/178.htm">178</a>)</small> <!-- a HREF="NT440/RXX.HTM" (R) --> After the judicial proof or
 confession of the debt, thirty days of grace were allowed
 before a Roman was delivered into the power of his fellow-
 citizen. In this private prison, twelve ounces of rice were
 his daily food; he might be bound with a chain of fifteen
 pounds weight; and his misery was thrice exposed in the
 market place, to solicit the compassion of his friends and
 countrymen. At the expiration of sixty days, the debt was
 discharged by the loss of liberty or life; the insolvent
 debtor was either put to death, or sold in foreign slavery
 beyond the Tyber: but, if several creditors were alike
 obstinate and unrelenting, they might legally dismember his
 body, and satiate their revenge by this horrid partition.
 The advocates for this savage law have insisted, that it
 must strongly operate in deterring idleness and fraud from
 contracting debts which they were unable to discharge; but
 experience would dissipate this salutary terror, by proving
 that no creditor could be found to exact this unprofitable
 penalty of life or limb. As the manners of Rome were
 insensibly polished, the criminal code of the decemvirs was
 abolished by the humanity of accusers, witnesses, and
 judges; and impunity became the consequence of immoderate
 rigor. The Porcian and Valerian laws prohibited the
 magistrates from inflicting on a free citizen any capital,
 or even corporal, punishment; and the obsolete statutes of
 blood were artfully, and perhaps truly, ascribed to the
 spirit, not of patrician, but of regal, tyranny.

</p><p id="abolition"> <small class="ok"><I>Abolition or oblivion of penal laws. </i></small><br>

 In the absence of penal laws, and the insufficiency of civil
 actions, the peace and justice of the city were imperfectly
 maintained by the private jurisdiction of the citizens. The
 malefactors who replenish our jails are the outcasts of
 society, and the crimes for which they suffer may be
 commonly ascribed to ignorance, poverty, and brutal
 appetite. For the perpetration of similar enormities, a
 vile plebeian might claim and abuse the sacred character of
 a member of the republic: but, on the proof or suspicion of
 guilt, the slave, or the stranger, was nailed to a cross;
 and this strict and summary justice might be exercised
 without restraint over the greatest part of the populace of
 Rome. Each family contained a domestic tribunal, which was
 not confined, like that of the praetor, to the cognizance of
 external actions: virtuous principles and habits were
 inculcated by the discipline of education; and the Roman
 father was accountable to the state for the manners of his
 children, since he disposed, without appeal, of their life,
 their liberty, and their inheritance. In some pressing
 emergencies, the citizen was authorized to avenge his
 private or public wrongs. The consent of the Jewish, the
 Athenian, and the Roman laws approved the slaughter of the
 nocturnal thief; though in open daylight a robber could not
 be slain without some previous evidence of danger and
 complaint. Whoever surprised an adulterer in his nuptial
 bed might freely exercise his revenge; <small>(<a href="nt440/179.htm">179</a>)</small> the most bloody
 and wanton outrage was excused by the provocation; <small>(<a href="nt440/180.htm">180</a>)</small> nor was it before the reign of Augustus that the husband was
 reduced to weigh the rank of the offender, or that the
 parent was condemned to sacrifice his daughter with her
 guilty seducer. After the expulsion of the kings, the
 ambitious Roman, who should dare to assume their title or
 imitate their tyranny, was devoted to the infernal gods:
 each of his fellow-citizens was armed with the sword of
 justice; and the act of Brutus, however repugnant to
 gratitude or prudence, had been already sanctified by the
 judgment of his country. <small>(<a href="nt440/181.htm">181</a>)</small> The barbarous practice of
 wearing arms in the midst of peace, <small>(<a href="nt440/182.htm">182</a>)</small> and the bloody
 maxims of honor, were unknown to the Romans; and, during the
 two purest ages, from the establishment of equal freedom to
 the end of the Punic wars, the city was never disturbed by
 sedition, and rarely polluted with atrocious crimes. The
 failure of penal laws was more sensibly felt, when every
 vice was inflamed by faction at home and dominion abroad.
 In the time of Cicero, each private citizen enjoyed the
 privilege of anarchy; each minister of the republic was
 exalted to the temptations of regal power, and their virtues
 are entitled to the warmest praise, as the spontaneous
 fruits of nature or philosophy. After a triennial
 indulgence of lust, rapine, and cruelty, Verres, the tyrant
 of Sicily, could only be sued for the pecuniary restitution
 of three hundred thousand pounds sterling; and such was the
 temper of the laws, the judges, and perhaps the accuser
 himself, <small>(<a href="nt440/183.htm">183</a>)</small> that, on refunding a thirteenth part of his
 plunder, Verres could retire to an easy and luxurious exile.
 <small>(<a href="nt440/184.htm">184</a>)</small>

</p><p id="revival"> <small class="ok"><I>Revival of capital punishments. </i></small><br>

 The first imperfect attempt to restore the proportion of
 crimes and punishments was made by the dictator Sylla, who,
 in the midst of his sanguinary triumph, aspired to restrain
 the license, rather than to oppress the liberty, of the
 Romans. He gloried in the arbitrary proscription of four
 thousand seven hundred citizens. <small>(<a href="nt440/185.htm">185</a>)</small> But, in the character
 of a legislator, he respected the prejudices of the times;
 and, instead of pronouncing a sentence of death against the
 robber or assassin, the general who betrayed an army, or the
 magistrate who ruined a province, Sylla was content to
 aggravate the pecuniary damages by the penalty of exile, or,
 in more constitutional language, by the interdiction of fire
 and water. The Cornelian, and afterwards the Pompeian and
 Julian, laws introduced a new system of criminal
 jurisprudence; <small>(<a href="nt440/186.htm">186</a>)</small> and the emperors, from Augustus to
 Justinian, disguised their increasing rigor under the names
 of the original authors. But the invention and frequent use
 of <I>extraordinary pains</I>, proceeded from the desire to extend
 and conceal the progress of despotism. In the condemnation
 of illustrious Romans, the senate was always prepared to
 confound, at the will of their masters, the judicial and
 legislative powers. It was the duty of the governors to
 maintain the peace of their province, by the arbitrary and
 rigid administration of justice; the freedom of the city
 evaporated in the extent of empire, and the Spanish
 malefactor, who claimed the privilege of a Roman, was
 elevated by the command of Galba on a fairer and more lofty
 cross. <small>(<a href="nt440/187.htm">187</a>)</small> Occasional rescripts issued from the throne to
 decide the questions which, by their novelty or importance,
 appeared to surpass the authority and discernment of a
 proconsul. Transportation and beheading were reserved for
 honorable persons; meaner criminals were either hanged, or
 burnt, or buried in the mines, or exposed to the wild beasts
 of the amphitheatre. Armed robbers were pursued and
 extirpated as the enemies of society; the driving away
 horses or cattle was made a capital offence; <small>(<a href="nt440/188.htm">188</a>)</small> but simple
 theft was uniformly considered as a mere civil and private
 injury. The degrees of guilt, and the modes of punishment,
 were too often determined by the discretion of the rulers,
 and the subject was left in ignorance of the legal danger
 which he might incur by every action of his life.

</p><p id="guilt"> <small class="ok"><I>Measure of guilt. </i></small><br>

 A sin, a vice, a crime, are the objects of theology, ethics,
 and jurisprudence. Whenever their judgments agree, they
 corroborate each other; but, as often as they differ, a
 prudent legislator appreciates the guilt and punishment
 according to the measure of social injury. On this
 principle, the most daring attack on the life and property
 of a private citizen is judged less atrocious than the crime
 of treason or rebellion, which invades the <I>majesty</I> of the
 republic: the obsequious civilians unanimously pronounced,
 that the republic is contained in the person of its chief;
 and the edge of the Julian law was sharpened by the
 incessant diligence of the emperors. The licentious
 commerce of the sexes may be tolerated as an impulse of
 nature, or forbidden as a source of disorder and corruption;
 but the fame, the fortunes, the family of the husband, are
 seriously injured by the adultery of the wife. The wisdom of
 Augustus, after curbing the freedom of revenge, applied to
 this domestic offence the animadversion of the laws: and the
 guilty parties, after the payment of heavy forfeitures and
 fines, were condemned to long or perpetual exile in two
 separate islands. <small>(<a href="nt440/189.htm">189</a>)</small> Religion pronounces an equal censure
 against the infidelity of the husband; but, as it is not
 accompanied by the same civil effects, the wife was never
 permitted to vindicate her wrongs; <small>(<a href="nt440/190.htm">190</a>)</small> and the distinction
 of simple or double adultery, so familiar and so important
 in the canon law, is unknown to the jurisprudence of the
 Code and the Pandects. <sup id="vice"> <I>Unnatural vice. </i></sup>  I touch with reluctance, and
 despatch with impatience, a more odious vice, of which
 modesty rejects the name, and nature abominates the idea.
 The primitive Romans were infected by the example of the
 Etruscans <small>(<a href="nt440/191.htm">191</a>)</small> and Greeks: <small>(<a href="nt440/192.htm">192</a>)</small> and in the mad abuse of
 prosperity and power, every pleasure that is innocent was
 deemed insipid; and the Scatinian law, <small>(<a href="nt440/193.htm">193</a>)</small> which had been
 extorted by an act of violence, was insensibly abolished by
 the lapse of time and the multitude of criminals. By this
 law, the rape, perhaps the seduction, of an ingenuous youth,
 was compensated, as a personal injury, by the poor damages
 of ten thousand sesterces, or fourscore pounds; the ravisher
 might be slain by the resistance or revenge of chastity; and
 I wish to believe, that at Rome, as in Athens, the voluntary
 and effeminate deserter of his sex was degraded from the
 honors and the rights of a citizen. <small>(<a href="nt440/194.htm">194</a>)</small> But the practice of
 vice was not discouraged by the severity of opinion: the
 indelible stain of manhood was confounded with the more
 venial transgressions of fornication and adultery, nor was
 the licentious lover exposed to the same dishonor which he
 impressed on the male or female partner of his guilt. From
 Catullus to Juvenal, <small>(<a href="nt440/195.htm">195</a>)</small> the poets accuse and celebrate the
 degeneracy of the times; and the reformation of manners was
 feebly attempted by the reason and authority of the
 civilians till the most virtuous of the Caesars proscribed
 the sin against nature as a crime against society. <small>(<a href="nt440/196.htm">196</a>)</small>

</p><p id="rigour"> <small class="ok"><I>Rigour of the Christian emperors. </i></small><br>

 A new spirit of legislation, respectable even in its error,
 arose in the empire with the religion of Constantine. <small>(<a href="nt440/197.htm">197</a>)</small>
 The laws of Moses were received as the divine original of
 justice, and the Christian princes adapted their penal
 statutes to the degrees of moral and religious turpitude.
 Adultery was first declared to be a capital offence: the
 frailty of the sexes was assimilated to poison or
 assassination, to sorcery or parricide; the same penalties
 were inflicted on the passive and active guilt of
 paederasty; and all criminals of free or servile condition
 were either drowned or beheaded, or cast alive into the
 avenging flames. The adulterers were spared by the common
 sympathy of mankind; but the lovers of their own sex were
 pursued by general and pious indignation: the impure manners
 of Greece still prevailed in the cities of Asia, and every
 vice was fomented by the celibacy of the monks and clergy.
 Justinian relaxed the punishment at least of female
 infidelity: the guilty spouse was only condemned to solitude
 and penance, and at the end of two years she might be
 recalled to the arms of a forgiving husband. But the same
 emperor declared himself the implacable enemy of unmanly
 lust, and the cruelty of his persecution can scarcely be
 excused by the purity of his motives. <small>(<a href="nt440/198.htm">198</a>)</small> In defiance of
 every principle of justice, he stretched to past as well as
 future offences the operations of his edicts, with the
 previous allowance of a short respite for confession and
 pardon. A painful death was inflicted by the amputation of
 the sinful instrument, or the insertion of sharp reeds into
 the pores and tubes of most exquisite sensibility; and
 Justinian defended the propriety of the execution, since the
 criminals would have lost their hands, had they been
 convicted of sacrilege. In this state of disgrace and agony,
 two bishops, Isaiah of Rhodes and Alexander of Diospolis,
 were dragged through the streets of Constantinople, while
 their brethren were admonished, by the voice of a crier, to
 observe this awful lesson, and not to pollute the sanctity
 of their character. Perhaps these prelates were innocent. A
 sentence of death and infamy was often founded on the slight
 and suspicious evidence of a child or a servant: the guilt
 of the green faction, of the rich, and of the enemies of
 Theodora, was presumed by the judges, and paederasty became
 the crime of those to whom no crime could be imputed. A
 French philosopher <small>(<a href="nt440/199.htm">199</a>)</small> has dared to remark that whatever is
 secret must be doubtful, and that our natural horror of vice
 may be abused as an engine of tyranny. But the favorable
 persuasion of the same writer, that a legislator may confide
 in the taste and reason of mankind, is impeached by the
 unwelcome discovery of the antiquity and extent of the
 disease. <small>(<a href="nt440/200.htm">200</a>)</small>

</p><p id="peoplejudge"> <small class="ok"><I>Judgements of the people. </i></small><br>

 The free citizens of Athens and Rome enjoyed, in all
 criminal cases, the invaluable privilege of being tried by
 their country. <small>(<a href="nt440/201.htm">201</a>)</small> 
 1. The administration of justice is the
 most ancient office of a prince: it was exercised by the
 Roman kings, and abused by Tarquin; who alone, without law
 or council, pronounced his arbitrary judgments. The first
 consuls succeeded to this regal prerogative; but the sacred
 right of appeal soon abolished the jurisdiction of the
 magistrates, and all public causes were decided by the
 supreme tribunal of the people. But a wild democracy,
 superior to the forms, too often disdains the essential
 principles, of justice: the pride of despotism was envenomed
 by plebeian envy, and the heroes of Athens might sometimes
 applaud the happiness of the Persian, whose fate depended on
 the caprice of a <I>single</I> tyrant. Some salutary restraints,
 imposed by the people or their own passions, were at once
 the cause and effect of the gravity and temperance of the
 Romans. The right of accusation was confined to the
 magistrates. A vote of the thirty five tribes could inflict
 a fine; but the cognizance of all capital crimes was
 reserved by a fundamental law to the assembly of the
 centuries, in which the weight of influence and property was
 sure to preponderate. Repeated proclamations and
 adjournments were interposed, to allow time for prejudice
 and resentment to subside: the whole proceeding might be
 annulled by a seasonable omen, or the opposition of a
 tribune; and such popular trials were commonly less
 formidable to innocence than they were favorable to guilt.
 But this union of the judicial and legislative powers left
 it doubtful whether the accused party was pardoned or
 acquitted; and, in the defence of an illustrious client, the
 orators of Rome and Athens address their arguments to the
 policy and benevolence, as well as to the justice, of their
 sovereign.  2. The task of convening the citizens for the
 trial of each offender became more difficult, as the
 citizens and the offenders continually multiplied; and the
 ready expedient was adopted of delegating the jurisdiction
 of the people to the ordinary magistrates, or to
 extraordinary <I>inquisitors</I>. In the first ages these
 questions were rare and occasional. In the beginning of the
 seventh century of Rome they were made perpetual: four
 praetors were annually empowered to sit in judgment on the
 state offences of treason, extortion, peculation, and
 bribery; and Sylla added new praetors and new questions for
 those crimes which more directly injure the safety of
 individuals. By these <I>inquisitors</I> the trial was prepared
 and directed; <sup id="judges"> <I>Select judges. </i></sup>  but they could only pronounce the sentence of
 the majority of <I>judges</I>, who with some truth, and more
 prejudice, have been compared to the English juries. <small>(<a href="nt440/202.htm">202</a>)</small> To discharge this important, though burdensome office, an
 annual list of ancient and respectable citizens was formed
 by the praetor. After many constitutional struggles, they
 were chosen in equal numbers from the senate, the equestrian
 order, and the people; four hundred and fifty were appointed
 for single questions; and the various rolls or <I>decuries</I> of
 judges must have contained the names of some thousand
 Romans, who represented the judicial authority of the state.
 In each particular cause, a sufficient number was drawn from
 the urn; their integrity was guarded by an oath; the mode of
 ballot secured their independence; the suspicion of
 partiality was removed by the mutual challenges of the
 accuser and defendant; and the judges of Milo, by the
 retrenchment of fifteen on each side, were reduced to
 fifty-one voices or tablets, of acquittal, of condemnation,
 or of favorable doubt. <small>(<a href="nt440/203.htm">203</a>)</small> 
3. In his civil jurisdiction,
 the praetor of the city was truly a judge, and almost a
 legislator; but, as soon as he had prescribed the action of
 law, he often referred to a delegate the determination of
 the fact. With the increase of legal proceedings, the
 tribunal of the centumvirs, in which he presided, acquired
 more weight and reputation. But whether he acted alone, or
 with the advice of his council, the most absolute powers
 might be trusted to a magistrate who was annually chosen by
 the votes of the people. The rules and precautions of
 freedom have required some explanation; the order of
 despotism is simple and inanimate. Before the age of
 Justinian, or perhaps of Diocletian, the decuries of Roman
 judges had sunk to an empty title: <sup id="assessors"> <I>Assessors. </i></sup>  the humble advice of the
 assessors might be accepted or despised; and in each
 tribunal the civil and criminal jurisdiction was
 administered by a single magistrate, who was raised and
 disgraced by the will of the emperor.

</p><p id="voluntary"> <small class="ok"><I>Voluntary exile and death. </i></small><br>

 A Roman accused of any capital crime might prevent the
 sentence of the law by voluntary exile, or death. Till his
 guilt had been legally proved, his innocence was presumed,
 and his person was free: till the votes of the last <I>century</I>
 had been counted and declared, he might peaceably secede to
 any of the allied cities of Italy, or Greece, or Asia. <small>(<a href="nt440/204.htm">204</a>)</small>
 His fame and fortunes were preserved, at least to his
 children, by this civil death; and he might still be happy
 in every rational and sensual enjoyment, if a mind
 accustomed to the ambitious tumult of Rome could support the
 uniformity and silence of Rhodes or Athens. A bolder effort
 was required to escape from the tyranny of the Caesars; but
 this effort was rendered familiar by the maxims of the
 stoics, the example of the bravest Romans, and the legal
 encouragements of suicide. The bodies of condemned criminals
 were exposed to public ignominy, and their children, a more
 serious evil, were reduced to poverty by the confiscation of
 their fortunes. But, if the victims of Tiberius and Nero
 anticipated the decree of the prince or senate, their
 courage and despatch were recompensed by the applause of the
 public, the decent honors of burial, and the validity of
 their testaments. <small>(<a href="nt440/205.htm">205</a>)</small> The exquisite avarice and cruelty of
 Domitian appear to have deprived the unfortunate of this
 last consolation, and it was still denied even by the
 clemency of the Antonines. A voluntary death, which, in the
 case of a capital offence, intervened between the accusation
 and the sentence, was admitted as a confession of guilt, and
 the spoils of the deceased were seized by the inhuman claims
 of the treasury. <small>(<a href="nt440/206.htm">206</a>)</small> Yet the civilians have always
 respected the natural right of a citizen to dispose of his
 life; and the posthumous disgrace invented by Tarquin, <small>(<a href="nt440/207.htm">207</a>)</small>
 to check the despair of his subjects, was never revived or
 imitated by succeeding tyrants. The powers of this world
 have indeed lost their dominion over him who is resolved on
 death; and his arm can only be restrained by the religious
 apprehension of a future state. Suicides are enumerated by
 Virgil among the unfortunate, rather than the guilty; <small>(<a href="nt440/208.htm">208</a>)</small>
 and the poetical fables of the infernal shades could not
 seriously influence the faith or practice of mankind. But
 the precepts of the gospel, or the church, have at length
 imposed a pious servitude on the minds of Christians, and
 condemn them to expect, without a murmur, the last stroke of
 disease or the executioner.

</p><p id="abuses"> <small class="ok"><I>Abuses of civil jurisprudence. </i></small><br>

 The penal statutes form a very small proportion of the
 sixty-two books of the Code and Pandects; and in all
 judicial proceedings, the life or death of a citizen is
 determined with less caution or delay than the most ordinary
 question of covenant or inheritance. This singular
 distinction, though something may be allowed for the urgent
 necessity of defending the peace of society, is derived from
 the nature of criminal and civil jurisprudence. Our duties
 to the state are simple and uniform: the law by which he is
 condemned is inscribed not only on brass or marble, but on
 the conscience of the offender, and his guilt is commonly
 proved by the testimony of a single fact. But our relations
 to each other are various and infinite; our obligations are
 created, annulled, and modified, by injuries, benefits, and
 promises; and the interpretation of voluntary contracts and
 testaments, which are often dictated by fraud or ignorance,
 affords a long and laborious exercise to the sagacity of the
 judge. The business of life is multiplied by the extent of
 commerce and dominion, and the residence of the parties in
 the distant provinces of an empire is productive of doubt,
 delay, and inevitable appeals from the local to the supreme
 magistrate. Justinian, the Greek emperor of Constantinople
 and the East, was the legal successor of the Latin shepherd
 who had planted a colony on the banks of the Tyber. In a
 period of thirteen hundred years, the laws had reluctantly
 followed the changes of government and manners; and the
 laudable desire of conciliating ancient names with recent
 institutions destroyed the harmony, and swelled the
 magnitude, of the obscure and irregular system. The laws
 which excuse, on any occasions, the ignorance of their
 subjects, confess their own imperfections: the civil
 jurisprudence, as it was abridged by Justinian, still
 continued a mysterious science, and a profitable trade, and
 the innate perplexity of the study was involved in tenfold
 darkness by the private industry of the practitioners. The
 expense of the pursuit sometimes exceeded the value of the
 prize, and the fairest rights were abandoned by the poverty
 or prudence of the claimants. Such costly justice might tend
 to abate the spirit of litigation, but the unequal pressure
 serves only to increase the influence of the rich, and to
 aggravate the misery of the poor. By these dilatory and
 expensive proceedings, the wealthy pleader obtains a more
 certain advantage than he could hope from the accidental
 corruption of his judge. The experience of an abuse, from
 which our own age and country are not perfectly exempt, may
 sometimes provoke a generous indignation, and extort the
 hasty wish of exchanging our elaborate jurisprudence for the
 simple and summary decrees of a Turkish cadhi. Our calmer
 reflection will suggest, that such forms and delays are
 necessary to guard the person and property of the citizen;
 that the discretion of the judge is the first engine of
 tyranny; and that the laws of a free people should foresee
 and determine every question that may probably arise in the
 exercise of power and the transactions of industry. But the
 government of Justinian united the evils of liberty and
 servitude; and the Romans were oppressed at the same time by
 the multiplicity of their laws and the arbitrary will of
 their master.
