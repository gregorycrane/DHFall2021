<h1>4. Invasion of Africa<br>
From Chapter <a href="chap51.htm#invasion" Title="Moslem Invasions">51</a> of <i><a href="../index.htm">The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire</a></i> by Edward Gibbon</h1> 

<p id="Abdallah"><small class="ok"><I>First invasion by Abdallah, A.D. 647</i></small><br>
 The conquest of Africa, from the Nile to the Atlantic Ocean, 
<small>(<a href="nt510/138.htm">138</a>)</small> was first attempted by the arms of the caliph Othman. The pious design was approved by the companions of Mahomet and the chiefs of the tribes; and twenty thousand Arabs marched from Medina, with the gifts and the blessing of the commander of the faithful. They were joined in the camp of Memphis by twenty thousand of their countrymen; and
 the conduct of the war was entrusted to Abdallah, <small>(<a href="nt510/139.htm">139</a>)</small> the son of Said and the foster-brother of the caliph, who had lately supplanted the conqueror and lieutenant of Egypt. Yet the favour of the prince, and the merit of his favourite, could not obliterate the guilt of his apostasy. The early conversion of Abdallah, and his skilful pen, had recommended him to the important office of transcribing the sheets of the Koran: he betrayed his trust, corrupted the text, derided the errors which he had made, and fled to Mecca to escape the justice, and expose the ignorance, of the apostle. After the conquest of Mecca, he fell prostrate at the feet of Mahomet; his tears, and the entreaties of Othman, extorted a reluctant pardon; out the prophet declared that he had so long hesitated, to allow time for some zealous disciple to avenge his injury in the blood of the apostate. With apparent fidelity and effective merit,
 he served the religion which it was no longer his interest
 to desert: his birth and talents gave him an honourable rank
 among the Koreish; and, in a nation of cavalry, Abdallah was
 renowned as the boldest and most dexterous horseman of
 Arabia. At the head of forty thousand Moslems, he advanced
 from Egypt into the unknown countries of the West. The sands
 of Barca might be impervious to a Roman legion but the Arabs
 were attended by their faithful camels; and the natives of
 the desert beheld without terror the familiar aspect of the
 soil and climate. After a painful march, they pitched their
 tents before the walls of Tripoli, <small>(<a href="nt510/140.htm">140</a>)</small> a maritime city in which the <I>name</I>, the wealth, and the inhabitants of the province had gradually centred, and which now maintains the third rank among the states of Barbary. A reinforcement of Greeks was surprised and cut in pieces on the sea-shore; but
 the fortifications of Tripoli resisted the first assaults; <sup id="Gregory"><I>Gregory and his daughter.</i></sup> and the Saracens were tempted by the approach of the praefect Gregory <small>(<a href="nt510/141.htm">141</a>)</small> to relinquish the labours of the siege for the perils and the hopes of a decisive action. If his standard was followed by one hundred and twenty thousand men, the regular bands of the empire must have been lost in the naked and disorderly crowd of Africans and Moors, who formed the strength, or rather the numbers, of his host. He rejected with indignation the option of the Koran or the tribute; and during several days the two armies were fiercely engaged from the dawn of light to the hour of noon, when their fatigue and the excessive heat compelled them to
 seek shelter and refreshment in their respective camps. The daughter of Gregory, a maid of incomparable beauty and spirit, is said to have fought by his side: from her earliest youth she was trained to mount on horseback, to
 draw the bow, and to wield the cimeter; and the richness of her arms and apparel were conspicuous in the foremost ranks of the battle. Her hand, with a hundred thousand pieces of gold, was offered for the head of the Arabian general, and the youths of Africa were excited by the prospect of the glorious prize. At the pressing solicitation of his brethren, Abdallah withdrew his person from the field; but the Saracens were discouraged by the retreat of their leader, and the repetition of these equal or unsuccessful conflicts.

</p><p id="Victory"><small class="ok"><I>Victory of the Arabs.</i></small><br>
 A noble Arabian, who afterwards became the adversary of Ali,
 and the father of a caliph, had signalized his valour in
 Egypt, and Zobeir <small>(<a href="nt510/142.htm">142</a>)</small> was the first who planted the scaling-ladder against the walls of Babylon. In the African war he was detached from the standard of Abdallah. On the news of the battle, Zobeir, with twelve companions, cut his way through the camp of the Greeks, and pressed forwards, without tasting either food or repose, to partake of the dangers of his brethren. He cast his eyes round the field: </p>
<blockquote> "Where," <em>said he, </em> "is our general?" <em class="on1">"In his tent." </em> </blockquote> 
<blockquote>"Is the tent a station for the general of the Moslems?" </blockquote> 
<p>Abdallah represented with a blush the importance of his own life, and
 the temptation that was held forth by the Roman praefect. </p>
<blockquote> "Retort," <em>said Zobeir, </em> "on the infidels their ungenerous attempt. Proclaim through the ranks that the head of Gregory
 shall be repaid with his captive daughter, and the equal sum of one hundred thousand pieces of gold." </blockquote> 
<p> To the courage and discretion of Zobeir the lieutenant of the caliph entrusted the execution of his own stratagem, which inclined the long-disputed balance in favour of the Saracens. Supplying by activity and artifice the deficiency of numbers, a part of their forces lay concealed in their tents, while the remainder prolonged an irregular skirmish with the enemy till the sun was high in the heavens. On both sides they retired with fainting steps: their horses were unbridled, their armour was laid aside, and the hostile nations prepared, or seemed to prepare, for the refreshment of the evening, and the encounter of the ensuing day. On a sudden the charge was sounded; the Arabian camp poured forth a swarm of fresh and intrepid warriors; and the long line of the Greeks and Africans was surprised, assaulted, overturned, by new squadrons of the faithful, who, to the eye of fanaticism, might appear as a band of angels descending from the sky. The praefect himself was slain by
 the hand of Zobeir: his daughter, who sought revenge and death, was surrounded and made prisoner; and the fugitives involved in their disaster the town of Sufetula, to which they escaped from the sabres and lances of the Arabs. Sufetula was built one hundred and fifty miles to the south of Carthage: a gentle declivity is watered by a running stream, and shaded by a grove of juniper-trees; and, in the ruins of a triumphal arch, a portico, and three temples of the Corinthian order, curiosity may yet admire the magnificence of the Romans. <small>(<a href="nt510/143.htm">143</a>)</small> After the fall of this opulent city, the provincials and Barbarians implored on all sides the mercy of the conqueror. His vanity or his zeal might be flattered by offers of tribute or professions of faith: but his losses, his fatigues, and the progress of an epidemical disease, prevented a solid establishment; and the Saracens, after a campaign of fifteen months, retreated to the confines of Egypt, with the captives and the wealth of their African expedition. The caliph's fifth was granted to a favourite, on the nominal payment of five hundred thousand pieces of gold; <small>(<a href="nt510/144.htm">144</a>)</small> but the state was doubly injured by this fallacious transaction, if each foot-soldier had shared one thousand, and each horseman three thousand, pieces, in the real division of the plunder. The author of the death of Gregory was expected to have claimed the most precious
 reward of the victory: from his silence it might be presumed that he had fallen in the battle, till the tears and exclamations of the praefect's daughter at the sight of Zobeir revealed the valour and modesty of that gallant soldier. The unfortunate virgin was offered, and almost rejected as a slave, by her father's murderer, who coolly declared that his sword was consecrated to the service of religion; and that he laboured for a recompense far above the charms of mortal beauty, or the riches of this transitory life. A reward congenial to his temper was the honourable commission of announcing to the caliph Othman the success of his arms. The companions the chiefs, and the people, were assembled in the mosch of Medina, to hear the interesting narrative of Zobeir; and as the orator forgot nothing except the merit of his own counsels and actions, the name of Abdallah was joined by the Arabians with the heroic names of Caled and Amrou. <small>(<a href="nt510/145.htm">145</a>)</small>

</p><p id="Saracens"><small class="ok"><I>Progress of the Saracens, A.D. 665-689.</i></small><br>
 The Western conquests of the Saracens were suspended near twenty years, till their dissensions were composed by the establishment of the house of Ommiyah; and the caliph Moawiyah was invited by the cries of the Africans themselves. The successors of Heraclius had been informed of the tribute which they had been compelled to stipulate with the Arabs, but instead of being moved to pity and relieve their distress, they imposed, as an equivalent or a fine, a second tribute of a similar amount. The ears of the Byzantine ministers were shut against the complaints of their poverty and ruin; their despair was reduced to prefer the dominion of a single master; and the extortions of the patriarch of Carthage, who was invested with civil and military power, provoked the sectaries, and even the Catholics, of the Roman province, to abjure the religion as well as the authority of their tyrants. The first lieutenant of Moawiyah acquired a just renown, subdued an important city, defeated an army of thirty thousand Greeks, swept away fourscore thousand captives, and enriched with their spoils the bold adventurers of Syria and Egypt. <small>(<a href="nt510/146.htm">146</a>)</small>But the title of conqueror of Africa is more justly due to his successor Akbah. He marched from Damascus at the head of ten thousand of the bravest Arabs; and the genuine force of the Moslems
 was enlarged by the doubtful aid and conversion of many thousand barbarians. It be difficult, nor is it necessary, to trace the accurate line of the progress of Akbah. The interior regions have been peopled by the Orientals with fictitious armies and imaginary citadels. In the warlike province of Zab, or Numidia, four-score thousand of the natives might assemble in arms; but the number of three hundred and sixty towns is incompatible with the ignorance
 or decay of husbandry; <small>(<a href="nt510/147.htm">147</a>)</small> and a circumference of three leagues will not be justified by the ruins of Erbe or
 Lambesa, the ancient metropolis of that inland country. As we approach the sea-coast, the well-known cities of Bugia <small>(<a href="nt510/148.htm">148</a>)</small> and Tangier <small>(<a href="nt510/149.htm">149</a>)</small> define the more certain limits of the
 Saracen victories. A remnant of trade still adheres to the
 commodious harbour of Bugia, which in a more prosperous age
 is said to have contained about twenty thousand houses; and
 the plenty of iron which is dug from the adjacent mountains
 might have supplied a braver people with the instruments of
 defence. The remote position and venerable antiquity of
 Tingi, or Tangier, have been decorated by the Greek and
 Arabian fables; but the figurative expressions of the
 latter, that the walls were constructed of brass, and that
 the roofs were covered with gold and silver, may be
 interpreted as the emblems of strength and opulence. The
 province of Mauritania Tingitana, <small>(<a href="nt510/150.htm">150</a>)</small> which assumed the name of the capital, had been imperfectly discovered and settled
 by the Romans; the five colonies were confined to a narrow
 pale, and the more southern parts were seldom explored
 except by the agents of luxury, who searched the forests for
 ivory and the citron-wood, <small>(<a href="nt510/151.htm">151</a>)</small> and the shores of the ocean for the purple shell-fish. The fearless Akbah plunged into the heart of the country, traversed the wilderness in which
 his successors erected the splendid capitals of Fez and
 Morocco, <small>(<a href="nt510/152.htm">152</a>)</small> and at length penetrated to the verge of the Atlantic and the great desert. The river Sus descends from the western sides of Mount Atlas, fertilises, like the Nile,
 the adjacent soil, and falls into the sea at a moderate distance from the Canary, or Fortunate, islands. Its banks were inhabited by the last of the Moors, a race of savages, without laws or discipline or religion: they were astonished by the strange and irresistible terrors of the Oriental arms; and as they possessed neither gold nor silver, the richest spoil was the beauty of the female captives, some of whom were afterwards sold for a thousand pieces of gold. The career, though not the zeal, of Akbah was checked by the prospect of a boundless ocean. He spurred his horse into the waves, and, raising his eyes to heaven, exclaimed with the tone of a fanatic, </p>
<blockquote> "Great God ! if my course were not stopped by this sea, I would still go on, to the unknown kingdoms of the West, preaching the unity of thy holy name, and putting to the sword the rebellious nations who worship any other gods than thee." <em><small>(<a href="nt510/153.htm">153</a>)</small></em></blockquote> 
<p> Yet this Mohammedan Alexander, who sighed for new worlds, was unable to preserve his recent conquests. By the universal defection of the
 Greeks and Africans he was recalled from the shores of the
 Atlantic, and the surrounding multitudes left him only the
 resource of an honourable death. The last scene was
 dignified by an example of national virtue. An ambitious
 chief, who had disputed the command and failed in the
 attempt, was led about as a prisoner in the camp of the
 Arabian general. The insurgents had trusted to his
 discontent and revenge; he disdained their offers and
 revealed their designs. In the hour of danger the grateful
 Akbah unlocked his fetters and advised him to retire; he
 chose to die under the banner of his rival. Embracing as
 friends and martyrs, they unsheathed their scimitars, broke
 their scabbards, and maintained an obstinate combat till
 they fell by each other's side on the last of their
 slaughtered countrymen. The third general or governor of
 Africa, Zuheir, avenged and encountered the fate of his
 predecessor. He vanquished the natives in many battles; he
 was overthrown by a powerful army which Constantinople had
 sent to the relief of Carthage.

</p><p id="Cairoan"><small class="ok"><I>The foundation of Cairoan, A.D. 670-675.</i></small><br>
 It had been the frequent practice of the Moorish tribes to
 join the invaders, to share the plunder, to profess the
 faith, and to revolt to their savage state of independence
 and idolatry on the first retreat or misfortune of the
 Moslems. The prudence of Akbah had proposed to found an
 Arabian colony in the heart of Africa a citadel that might
 curb the levity of the barbarians, a place of refuge to
 secure, against the accidents of war, the wealth and the
 families of the Saracens. With this view, and under the
 modest title of the station of a caravan, he planted this
 colony in the fiftieth year of the Hegira. In its present
 decay, Cairoan <small>(<a href="nt510/154.htm">154</a>)</small> still holds the second rank in the kingdom of Tunis, from which it is distant about fifty miles to the south: <small>(<a href="nt510/155.htm">155</a>)</small> its inland situation, twelve miles west-ward of the sea, has protected the city from the Greek and Sicilian fleets. When the wild beasts and serpents were extirpated, when the forest, or rather wilderness, was cleared, the vestiges of a Roman town were discovered in a sandy plain: the vegetable food of Cairoan is brought from afar; and the scarcity of springs constrains the inhabitants to collect in cisterns and reservoirs a precarious supply of rain-water. These obstacles were subdued by the industry of Akbah; he traced a circumference of three thousand and six hundred paces, which he encompassed with a brick wall; in the space of five years the governor's palace was surrounded with a sufficient number of private habitations; a spacious mosch was supported by five hundred columns of granite, porphyry, and Numidian marble; and Cairoan became the seat of learning as well as of empire. But these were the glories of a later age; the new colony was shaken by the
 successive defeats of Akbah and Zuheir, and the western expeditions were again interrupted by the civil discord of the Arabian monarchy. The son of the valiant Zobeir maintained a war of twelve years, a siege of seven months, against the house of Ommiyah. Abdallah was said to unite the fierceness of the lion with the subtlety of the fox; but if he inherited the courage, he was devoid of the generosity, of his father. <small>(<a href="nt510/156.htm">156</a>)</small>

</p><p id="Carthage"><small class="ok"><I>Conquest of Carthage, A.D. 692-698.</i></small><br>
 The return of domestic peace allowed the caliph Abdalmalek
 to resume the conquest of Africa; the standard was delivered
 to Hassan, governor of Egypt, and the revenue of that
 kingdom, with an army of forty thousand men, was consecrated
 to the important service. In the vicissitudes of war, the
 interior provinces had been alternately won and lost by the
 Saracens. But the sea-coast still remained in the hands of
 the Greeks; the predecessors of Hassan had respected the
 name and fortifications of Carthage; and the number of its
 defenders was recruited by the fugitives of Cabes and
 Tripoli. The arms of Hassan were bolder and more fortunate:
 he reduced and pillaged the metropolis of Africa; and the
 mention of scaling-ladders may justify the suspicion that he
 anticipated by a sudden assault the more tedious operations
 of a regular siege. But the joy of the conquerors was soon
 disturbed by the appearance of the Christian succours. The
 praefect and patrician John, a general of experience and
 renown, embarked at Constantinople the forces of the Eastern
 empire; <small>(<a href="nt510/157.htm">157</a>)</small> they were joined by the ships and soldiers of Sicily, and a powerful reinforcement of Goths <small>(<a href="nt510/158.htm">158</a>)</small> was obtained from the fears and religion of the Spanish monarch. The weight of the confederate navy broke the chain that guarded the entrance of the harbour; the Arabs retired to
 Cairoan, or Tripoli; the Christians landed; the citizens hailed the ensign of the cross, and the winter was idly wasted in the dream of victory or deliverance. But Africa was irrecoverably lost; the zeal and resentment of be
 commander of the faithful <small>(<a href="nt510/159.htm">159</a>)</small> prepared in the ensuing spring a more numerous armament by sea and land; and the patrician in his turn was compelled to evacuate the post and fortifications of Carthage. A second battle was fought in the neighbourhood of Utica: the Greeks and Goths were again defeated; and their timely embarkation saved them from the sword of Hassan, who had invested the slight and insufficient rampart of their camp. Whatever yet remained of Carthage was delivered to the flames, and the colony of Dido <small>(<a href="nt510/160.htm">160</a>)</small> and Caesain lay desolate above two hundred years, till a part, perhaps a twentieth, of the old circumference was repeopled by the first of the Fatimite caliphs. In the beginning of the sixteenth-century the second capital of the West was represented by a mosch, a college without students, twenty-five or thirty shops, and the huts of five
 hundred peasants, who, in their abject poverty, displayed the arrogance of the Punic senators. Even that paltry village was swept away by the Spaniards whom Charles the Fifth had stationed in the fortress of the Goletta. The ruins
 of Carthage have perished; and the place might be unknown if some broken arches of an aqueduct did not guide the footsteps of the inquisitive traveller. <small>(<a href="nt510/161.htm">161</a>)</small>

</p><p id="Final"><small class="ok"><I>Final conquest of Africa, A.D. 698-709.</i></small><br>
 The Greeks were expelled, but the Arabians were not yet masters of the country. In the interior provinces the Moors or <i>Berbers</i>, <small>(<a href="nt510/162.htm">162</a>)</small> so feeble under the first Caesars, so formidable to the Byantine princes, maintained a disorderly resistance to the religion and power of the successors of Mohammed. Under the standard of their queen Cahina the independent tribes acquired some degree of union and discipline; and as the Moors respected in their females the character of a prophetess, they attacked the invaders with an enthusiasm similar to their own. The veteran bands of Hassan were inadequate to the defence of Africa: the conquests of an age were lost in a single day; and the Arabian chief overwhelmed by the torrent, retired to the confines of Egypt, and expected, five years, the promised succours of the caliph. After the retreat of the Saracens, the victorious prophetess assembled the Moorish chiefs, and recommended a measure of strange and savage policy. </p>
<blockquote> "Our cities," <em>said she, </em> "and the gold and silver which they contain, perpetually attract the arms of the Arabs. These vile metals are not the objects of our ambition; we content ourselves with the simple productions of the earth. Let us destroy these cities; let us bury in their ruins those pernicious treasures; and when the avarice of our foes shall be destitute of temptation, perhaps they will cease to disturb the tranquillity of a warlike people." </blockquote> 
<p> The proposal was accepted with unanimous applause. From Tangier to Tripoli the buildings, or at least the fortifications, were demolished, the 
fruit-trees were cut own, the means of subsistence were extirpated, fertile and populous garden was changed into desert, and the historians of a more recent period could discern the frequent traces of the prosperity and devastation of their ancestors. Such is the tale of the modern Arabians. Yet I strongly suspect that their ignorance of antiquity, the love of the marvellous, and the fashion of extolling the philosophy of barbarians, has induced them to describe, as one voluntary act, the calamities of three hundred years since the first fury of the Donatists and Vandals. In the progress of the revolt Cahina had most probably contributed her share of destruction, and the alarm of universal ruin might terrify and alienate the cities that had reluctantly yielded to her unworthy yoke. They no longer hoped, perhaps they no longer wished, the return of their Byzantine sovereigns: their present servitude was not alleviated by the benefits of order and justice; and the most zealous Catholic must prefer the imperfect truths of the Koran to the blind and rude idolatry of the Moors. The general of the Saracens was again received as the saviour of the province: the friends of civil society conspired against the savages of the land and the royal prophetess was slain in the first battle, which overturned the baseless fabric of her superstition and empire. The same spirit revived under the successor of Hassan: it was finally quelled by the activity of Musa and his two sons; but the number of the rebels may be presumed from that of three hundred thousand captives; sixty thousand of whom, the caliph's fifth, were sold for the profit of the public treasury. Thirty thousand of the barbarian youth were enlisted in the troops; and the pious labours of Musa, to inculcate the knowledge and practice of the Koran, accustomed the Africans to obey the apostle of God and the commander of the faithful. In their climate and government, their diet and habitation, the wandering Moors resembled the Bedoweens of the desert. <sup id="Moors"><I>Adoption of the Moors.</i></sup> With the religion they were proud to adopt the language, name, and origin of Arabs: the blood of the strangers and natives was insensibly mingled; and from the Euphrates to the Atlantic the same nation might seem to be diffused over the sandy plains of Asia and Africa. Yet I will not deny that fifty thousand tents of pure Arabians might be transported over the Nile, and scattered through the Libyan desert; and I am not ignorant that five of the Moorish tribes still retain their <i>barbarous</i> idiom, with the appellation and character of <i>white</I> Africans. <small>(<a href="nt510/163.htm">163</a>)</small></p>
