ern basis presents a front of a thousand miles to the Indian Ocean. The ent=
ire surface of the peninsula exceeds in a fourfold proportion that of Germa=
ny or France; but the far greater part has been justly stigmatised with the=
 epithets of the <i>stony</i> and the <i>sandy.</i> Even the wilds of Tarta=
ry are decked by the hand of nature with lofty trees and luxuriant herbage;=
 and the lonesome traveller derives a sort of comfort and society from the =
presence of vegetable life. But in the dreary waste of Arabia, a boundless =
level of sand is intersected by sharp and naked mountains, and the face of =
the desert, without shade or shelter, is scorched by the direct and intense=
 rays of a tropical sun. Instead of refreshing breezes, the winds, particul=
arly from the south-west, diffuse a noxious and even deadly vapour; the hil=
locks of sand which they alternately raise and scatter are compared to the =
billows of the ocean; and whole caravans, whole armies, have been lost and =
buried in the whirlwind. The common benefits of water are an object of desi=
re and contest; and such is the scarcity of wood that some art is requisite=
 to preserve and propagate the element of fire. Arabia is destitute of navi=
gable rivers, which fertilise the soil and convey its produce to the adjace=
nt regions; the torrents that fall from the hills are imbibed by the thirst=
y earth; the rare and hardy plants, the tamarind or the acacia, that strike=
 their roots into the clefts of the rocks, are nourished by the dews of the=
 night; a scanty supply of rain is collected in cisterns and aqueducts; the=
 wells and springs are the secret treasure of the desert; and the pilgrim o=
f Mecca,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-th=

nd genuine picture of the climate of Arabia. The experience of evil enhance=
s the value of any local or partial enjoyments. A shady grove, a green past=
ure, a stream of fresh water, are sufficient to attract a colony of sedenta=
ry Arabs to the fortunate spots which can afford food and refreshment to th=
emselves and their cattle, and which encourage their industry in the cultiv=
ation of the palm-tree and the vine. The high lands that border on the Indi=
an Ocean are distinguished by their superior plenty of wood and water; the =
air is more temperate, the fruits are more delicious, the animals and the h=
uman race more numerous; the fertility of the soil invites and rewards the =
toil of the husbandman; and the peculiar gifts of frankincense<a href=3D"ht=

he sharp and perilous bridge of the abyss; but the innocent, treading in th=
e footsteps of Mahomet, will gloriously enter the gates of paradise, while =
the guilty will fall into the first and mildest of the seven hells. The ter=
m of expiation will vary from nine hundred to seven thousand years; but the=
 prophet has judiciously promised that <i>all</i> his disciples, whatever m=
ay be their sins, shall be saved, by their own faith and his intercession, =
from eternal damnation. It is not surprising that superstition should act m=
ost powerfully on the fears of her votaries, since the human fancy can pain=
t with more energy the misery than the bliss of a future life. With the two=
 simple elements of darkness and fire we create a sensation of pain, which =
may be aggravated to an infinite degree by the idea of endless duration. Bu=
t the same idea operates with an opposite effect on the continuity of pleas=
ure; and too much of our present enjoyments is obtained from the relief, or=
 the comparison, of evil. It is natural enough that an Arabian prophet shou=
ld dwell with rapture on the groves, the fountains, and the rivers of parad=
ise; but, instead of inspiring the blessed inhabitants with a liberal taste=
 for harmony and science, conversation and friendship, he idly celebrates t=
he pearls and diamonds, the robes of silk, palaces of marble, dishes of gol=
d, rich wines, artificial dainties, numerous attendants, and the whole trai=
n of sensual and costly luxury, which becomes insipid to the owner, even in=
 the short period of this mortal life. Seventy-two <i>Houris,</i> or black-=
eyed girls of resplendent beauty, blooming youth, virgin purity, and exquis=
ite sensibility, will be created for the use of the meanest believer; a mom=
ent of pleasure will be prolonged to a thousand years, and his faculties wi=
ll be increased an hundred-fold, to render him worthy of his felicity. Notw=
ithstanding a vulgar prejudice, the gates of heaven will be open to both se=
xes; but Mahomet has not specified the male companions of the female elect,=
 lest he should either alarm the jealousy of their former husbands or distu=
rb their felicity by the suspicion of an everlasting <span class=3D"pb"><sp=

of a carnal paradise has provoked the indignation, perhaps the envy, of the=
 monks: they declaim against the impure religion of Mahomet; and his modest=
 apologists are driven to the poor excuse of figures and allegories. But th=
e sounder and more consistent party adhere, without shame, to the literal i=
nterpretation of the Koran; useless would be the resurrection of the body, =
unless it were restored to the possession and exercise of its worthiest fac=
ulties; and the union of sensual and intellectual enjoyment is requisite to=
 complete the happiness of the double animal, the perfect man. Yet the joys=
 of the Mahometan paradise will not be confined to the indulgence of luxury=
 and appetite; and the prophet has expressly declared that all meaner happi=
ness will be forgotten and despised by the saints and martyrs, who shall be=
 admitted to the beatitude of the divine vision.<a href=3D"https://oll.libe=

omet were those of pure and genuine benevolence; but a human missionary is =
incapable of cherishing the obstinate unbelievers who reject his claims, de=
spise his arguments, and persecute his life; he might forgive his personal =
adversaries, he may lawfully hate the enemies of God; the stern passions of=
 pride and revenge were kindled in the bosom of Mahomet, and he sighed, lik=
e the prophet of Nineveh, for the destruction of the rebels whom he had con=
demned. The injustice of Mecca and the choice of Medina transformed the cit=
izen into a prince, the humble preacher into the leader of armies; but his =
sword was consecrated by the example of the saints; and the same God who af=
flicts a sinful world with pestilence and earthquakes might inspire for the=
ir conversion or chastisement the valour of his servants. In the exercise o=
f political government, he was compelled to abate of the stern rigour of fa=
naticism, to comply in some measure with the prejudices and passions of his=
 followers, and to employ even the vices of mankind as the instruments of t=
heir salvation. The use of fraud and perfidy, of cruelty and injustice, wer=
e often subservient to the propagation of the faith; and Mahomet commanded =
or approved the assassination of the Jews and idolaters who had escaped fro=
m the field of battle. By the repetition of such acts, the character of Mah=
omet must have been gradually stained; and the influence of such pernicious=
 habits would be poorly compensated by the practice of the personal and soc=
ial virtues which are necessary to maintain the reputation of a prophet amo=

ride of the chief of the Hashemites; declared that he had rather serve than=
 reign; rebuked the presumption of the strangers; and required the formal, =
if not the voluntary, assent of the chiefs of the nation. He has never been=
 accused of prompting the assassin of Omar; though Persia indiscreetly cele=
brates the festival of that holy martyr. The quarrel between Othman and his=
 subjects was assuaged by the early mediation of Ali; and Hassan, the eldes=

t is doubtful whether the father of Hassan was strenuous and sincere in his=
 opposition to the rebels; and it is certain that he enjoyed the benefit of=
 their crime. The temptation was indeed of such magnitude as might stagger =
and corrupt the most obdurate virtue. The ambitious candidate no longer asp=
ired to the barren sceptre of Arabia: the Saracens had been victorious in t=
he East and West; and the wealthy kingdoms of Persia, Syria, and Egypt were=
 the patrimony of the commander of the faithful.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_288">A life of prayer and contemplation had not chi=
lled the martial activity of Ali; but in a mature age, after a long experie=
nce of mankind, he still betrayed in his conduct the rashness and indiscret=
ion of youth. In the first days of his reign, he neglected to secure, eithe=
r by gifts or fetters, the doubtful allegiance of Telha and Zobeir, two of =
the most powerful of the Arabian chiefs. They escaped from Medina to Mecca,=
 and from thence to Bassora; erected the standard of revolt; and usurped th=
e government of Irak, or Assyria, which they had vainly solicited as the re=
ward of their services. The mask of patriotism is allowed to cover the most=
 glaring inconsistencies; and the enemies, perhaps the assassins, of Othman=
 now demanded vengeance for his blood. They were accompanied in their fligh=
t by Ayesha, the widow of the prophet, who cherished, to the last hour of h=
er life, an implacable <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Editio=
n: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>98<span class=3D"b=
racket">]</span></span> hatred against the husband and the posterity of Fat=
ima. The most reasonable Moslems were scandalised that the mother of the fa=
ithful should expose in a camp her person and character; but the superstiti=
ous crowd was confident that her presence would sanctify the justice, and a=
ssure the success, of their cause. At the head of twenty thousand of his lo=
yal Arabs and nine thousand valiant auxiliaries of Cufa, the caliph encount=
ered and defeated the superior numbers of the rebels under the walls of Bas=
sora. Their leaders, Telha and Zobeir, were slain in the first battle that =
stained with civil blood the arms of the Moslems. After passing through the=
 ranks to animate the troops, Ayesha had chosen her post amidst the dangers=
 of the field. In the heat of the action, seventy men who held the bridle o=
f her camel were successively killed or wounded; and the cage or litter in =
which she sat was stuck with javelins and darts like the quills of a porcup=
ine. The venerable captive sustained with firmness the reproaches of the co=
nqueror, and was speedily dismissed to her proper station, at the tomb of M=
ahomet, with the respect and tenderness that was still due to the widow of =
the apostle. After this victory, which was styled the Day of the Camel, Ali=
 marched against a more formidable adversary: against Moawiyah, the son of =
Abu Sophian, who had assumed the title of caliph, and whose claim was suppo=
rted by the forces of Syria and the interest of the house of the Ommiyah. F=

 waged a desultory war of one hundred and ten days. In the course of ninety=
 actions or skirmishes, the loss of Ali was estimated at twenty-five, that =
of Moawiyah at forty-five, thousand soldiers; and the list of the slain was=
 dignified with the names of five and twenty veterans who had fought at Bed=

aliph displayed a superior character of valour and humanity. His troops wer=
e strictly enjoined to await the first onset of the enemy, to spare their f=
lying brethren, and to respect the bodies of the dead and the chastity of t=
he female captives. He generously proposed to save the blood of the Moslems=
 by a single combat; but his trembling rival declined the challenge as a se=
ntence of inevitable death. The ranks of the Syrians were broken by the cha=
rge of a hero who was mounted on a piebald horse, and wielded with irresist=
ible force his ponderous and two-edged sword. As often as he smote a rebel,=
 he shouted the Allah Acbar, =E2=80=9CGod is victorious;=E2=80=9D and in th=
e tumult of a nocturnal battle he was heard to repeat four hundred times th=
at tremendous exclamation. The prince of Damascus already meditated his fli=
ght, but the certain victory was snatched from the grasp of Ali by the diso=
bedience and enthusiasm of his troops. Their conscience was awed by the sol=
emn appeal to the books of the Koran which Moawiyah exposed on the foremost=
 lances; and Ali was compelled to yield to a disgraceful truce and an insid=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_292">The talents of Mahomet are entitled to our app=
lause, but his success has perhaps too strongly attracted our admiration. A=
re we surprised that a multitude of proselytes should embrace the doctrine =
and the passions of an eloquent fanatic? In the heresies of the church, the=
 same seduction has been tried and repeated from the time of the apostles t=
o that of the reformers. Does it seem incredible that a private citizen sho=
uld grasp the sword and the sceptre, subdue his native country, and erect a=
 monarchy by his victorious arms? In the moving picture of the dynasties of=
 the East, an hundred fortunate usurpers have arisen from a baser origin, s=
urmounted more formidable obstacles, and filled a larger scope of empire an=
d conquest. Mahomet was alike instructed to preach and to fight, and the un=
ion of these opposite qualities, while it enhanced his merit, contributed t=
o his success: the operation of force and persuasion, of enthusiasm and fea=
r, continually acted on each other, till every barrier yielded to their irr=

s and rapine, to the indulgence of their darling passions in this world and=
 the other; the restraints which he imposed were requisite to establish the=
 credit of the prophet and to exercise the obedience of the people; and the=
 only objection to his success was his rational creed of the unity and perf=
ections of God. It is not the propagation but the permanency of his religio=
n that deserves our wonder: the same pure and perfect impression which he e=
ngraved at Mecca and Medina is preserved, after the revolutions of twelve c=
enturies, by the Indian, the African, and the Turkish proselytes of the Kor=
an. If the Christian <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition:=

 Vatican, they might possibly inquire the name of the Deity who is worshipp=
ed with such mysterious rites in that magnificent temple: at Oxford or Gene=
va, they would experience less surprise; but it might still be incumbent on=
 them to peruse the catechism of the church, and to study the orthodox comm=
entators on their own writings and the words of their Master. But the Turki=
sh dome of St. Sophia, with an increase of splendour and size, represents t=
he humble tabernacle erected at Medina by the hands of Mahomet. The Mahomet=
ans have uniformly withstood the temptation of reducing the object of their=
 faith and devotion to a level with the senses and imagination of man. =E2=
=80=9CI believe in one God, and Mahomet the apostle of God,=E2=80=9D is the=
 simple and invariable profession of Islam. The intellectual image of the D=
eity has never been degraded by any visible idol; the honours of the prophe=
t have never transgressed the measure of human virtue; and his living prece=
pts have restrained the gratitude of his disciples within the bounds of rea=
son and religion. The votaries of Ali have indeed consecrated the memory of=
 their hero, his wife, and his children; and some of the Persian doctors pr=
etend that the divine essence was incarnate in the person of the Imams; but=
 their superstition is universally condemned by the Sonnites; and their imp=
iety has afforded a seasonable warning against the worship of saints and ma=
rtyrs. The metaphysical questions on the attributes of God and the liberty =
of man have been agitated in the schools of the Mahometans as well as in th=
ose of the Christians; but among the former they have never engaged the pas=
sions of the people or disturbed the tranquillity of the state. The cause o=
f this important difference may be found in the separation or union of the =
regal and sacerdotal characters. It was the interest of the caliphs, the su=
ccessors of the prophet and commanders of the faithful, to repress and disc=
ourage all religious innovations: the order, the discipline, the temporal a=
nd spiritual ambition of the clergy <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decor=
ation">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>109<s=
pan class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> are unknown to the Moslems; and the s=
ages of the law are the guides of their conscience and the oracles of their=
 faith. From the Atlantic to the Ganges, the Koran is acknowledged as the f=
undamental code, not only of theology but of civil and criminal jurispruden=
ce; and the laws which regulate the actions and the property of mankind are=
 guarded by the infallible and immutable sanction of the will of God. This =
religious servitude is attended with some practical disadvantage; the illit=
erate legislator had been often misled by his own prejudices and those of h=
is country; and the institutions of the Arabian desert may be ill adapted t=
o the wealth and numbers of Ispahan and Constantinople. On these occasions,=
 the Cadhi respectfully places on his head the holy volume, and substitutes=
 a dexterous interpretation, more apposite to the principles of equity and =
the manners and policy of the times.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_293">His beneficial or pernicious influence on the =
public happiness is the last consideration in the character of Mahomet. The=
 most bitter or most bigoted of his Christian or Jewish foes will surely al=
low that he assumed a false commission to inculcate a salutary doctrine, le=
ss perfect only than their own. He piously supposed, as the basis of his re=
ligion, the truth and sanctity of <i>their</i> prior revelations, the virtu=
es and miracles of their founders. The idols of Arabia were broken before t=
he throne of God; the blood of human victims was expiated by prayer and fas=
ting and alms, the laudable or innocent arts of devotion; and his rewards a=
nd punishments of a future life were painted by the images most congenial t=
o an ignorant and carnal generation. Mahomet was perhaps incapable of dicta=
ting a moral and political system for the use of his countrymen; but he bre=
athed among the faithful a spirit of charity and friendship, recommended th=
e practice of the social virtues, and checked, by his laws and precepts, th=
e thirst of revenge and the oppression of widows and orphans. The hostile t=
ribes were united in faith and obedience, and the valour which had been idl=
y spent in domestic <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: =

emy. Had the impulse been less powerful, Arabia, free at home and formidabl=
e abroad, might have flourished under a succession of her native monarchs. =
Her sovereignty was lost by the extent and rapidity of conquest. The coloni=
es of the nation were scattered over the East and West, and their blood was=
 mingled with the blood of their converts and captives. After the reign of =
three caliphs the throne was transported from Medina to the valley of Damas=
cus and the banks of the Tigris; the holy cities were violated by impious w=
ar; Arabia was ruled by the rod of a subject, perhaps of a stranger; and th=
e Bedoweens of the desert, awakening from their dream of dominion, resumed =
their old and solitary independence.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_295"><span class=3D"csc">The</span> revolution of A=
rabia had not changed the character of the Arabs: the death of Mahomet was =
the signal of independence; and the hasty structure of his power and religi=
on tottered to its foundations. A small and faithful band of his primitive =
disciples had listened to his eloquence and shared his distress; had fled w=
ith the apostle from the persecution of Mecca or had received the fugitive =
in the walls of Medina. The increasing myriads, who acknowledged Mahomet as=
 their king and prophet, had been compelled by his arms or allured by his p=
rosperity. The polytheists were confounded by the simple idea of a solitary=
 and invisible God; the pride of the Christians and Jews disdained the yoke=
 of a mortal and contemporary legislator. Their habits of faith and obedien=
ce were not sufficiently confirmed; and many of the new converts regretted =
the venerable antiquity of the law of Moses, or the rites and mysteries of =
the Catholic church, or the idols, the sacrifices, the joyous festivals, of=
 their pagan ancestors. The jarring interests and hereditary feuds of the A=
rabian tribes had not yet coalesced in a system of union and subordination;=
 and the Barbarians were impatient of the mildest and most salutary laws th=
at curbed their passions or violated their customs. They submitted with rel=
uctance to the religious precepts of the Koran, the abstinence from wine, t=
he fast of the Ramadan, and the daily repetition of five prayers; and the a=
lms and tithes, which were collected for the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=

 distinguished only by a name from the payment of a perpetual and ignominio=
us tribute. The example of Mahomet had excited a spirit of fanaticism or im=
posture, and several of his rivals presumed to imitate the conduct and defy=
 the authority of the living prophet. At the head of the <i>fugitives</i> a=
nd <i>auxiliaries,</i> the first caliph was reduced to the cities of Mecca,=
 Medina, and Tayef; and perhaps the Koreish would have restored the idols o=

 persecution and wars of the prophet; and the personal assurance of paradis=
e must have taught them to despise the pleasures and dangers of the present=
 world. But they ascended the throne in a venerable or mature age, and este=
emed the domestic cares of religion and justice the most important duties o=
f a sovereign. Except the presence of Omar at the siege of Jerusalem, the l=
ongest expeditions were the frequent pilgrimages from Medina to Mecca; and =
they calmly received the tidings of victory as they prayed or preached befo=
re the sepulchre of the prophet. The austere and frugal measure of their li=
ves was the effect of virtue or habit, and the pride of their simplicity in=
sulted the vain magnificence of the kings of the earth. When Abubeker assum=
ed the office of caliph, he enjoined his daughter Ayesha to take a strict a=
ccount of his private patrimony, that it might be evident whether he were e=
nriched or impoverished by the service of the state. He thought himself ent=
itled to a stipend of three pieces of gold, with the sufficient maintenance=
 of a single camel and a black slave; but on the Friday of each week he dis=
tributed the residue of his own and the public money, first to the most wor=
thy, and then to the most indigent, of the Moslems. The remains of his weal=
th, a coarse garment and five pieces of gold, were delivered to his success=
or, who lamented with a modest sigh his own inability to equal such an admi=
rable model. Yet the abstinence and humility of Omar were not <span class=

ss=3D"bracket">[</span>115<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> inferior =
to the virtues of Abubeker: his food consisted of barley-bread or dates; hi=
s drink was water; he preached in a gown that was torn or tattered in twelv=
e places; and a Persian satrap, who paid his homage to the conqueror, found=
 him asleep among the beggars on the steps of the mosch of Medina. Economy =
is the source of liberality, and the increase of the revenue enabled Omar t=
o establish a just and perpetual reward for the past and present services o=
f the faithful. Careless of his own emolument, he assigned to Abbas, the un=
cle of the prophet, the first and most ample allowance of twenty-five thous=
and drachms or pieces of silver. Five thousand were allotted to each of the=
 aged warriors, the relics of the field of Beder, and the last and meanest =
of the companions of Mahomet was distinguished by the annual reward of thre=
e thousand pieces. One thousand was the stipend of the veterans who had fou=
ght in the first battles against the Greeks and Persians, and the decreasin=
g pay, as low as fifty pieces of silver, was adapted to the respective meri=
t and seniority of the soldiers of Omar. Under his reign and that of his pr=
edecessor, the conquerors of the East were the trusty servants of God and t=
he people; the mass of the public treasure was consecrated to the expenses =
of peace and war; a prudent mixture of justice and bounty maintained the di=

 design was covered by the appearance of a retreat; and the camp of the Sar=
acens was pitched about a league from Aleppo. The thirty adventurers lay in=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_316">In the life of Heraclius, the glories of the P=
ersian war are clouded on either hand by the disgrace and weakness of his m=
ore early and his later days. When the successors of Mahomet unsheathed the=
 sword of war and religion, he was astonished at the boundless prospect of =
toil and danger; his nature was indolent, nor could the infirm and frigid a=
ge of the emperor be kindled to a second effort. The sense of shame, and th=
e importunities of the Syrians, prevented his hasty departure from the scen=
e of action; but the hero was no more; and the loss of Damascus and Jerusal=
em, the bloody fields of Aiznadin and Yermuk, may be imputed in some degree=
 to the absence or misconduct of the sovereign. Instead of defending the se=
pulchre of Christ, he involved the church and state in a metaphysical contr=
oversy for the unity of his will; and, while Heraclius crowned the offsprin=
g of his second nuptials, he was tamely stripped of the most valuable part =
of their inheritance. In the cathedral of Antioch, in the presence of the b=
ishops, at the foot of the crucifix, he bewailed the sins of the prince and=
 people; but his confession instructed the world that it was vain, and perh=
aps impious, to resist the judgment of God. The Saracens were invincible in=
 fact, since they were invincible in opinion; and the desertion of Youkinna=
, his false repentance and repeated perfidy, might justify the suspicion of=
 the emperor that he was encompassed by traitors and apostates who conspire=
d to betray his person and their country to the enemies of Christ. In the h=
our of adversity, his superstition was agitated by the omens and dreams of =
a falling crown; and, after bidding an eternal farewell to Syria, he secret=

, was kind and liberal to his brethren. After a just tribute of praise and =
thanksgiving, he dropped a tear of compassion; and, sitting down on the gro=
und, wrote an answer, in which he mildly censured the severity of his lieut=
enant: =E2=80=9CGod,=E2=80=9D said the successor of the prophet, =E2=80=9Ch=
as not forbidden the use of the good things of this world to faithful men, =
and such as have performed good works: therefore, you ought to have given t=

 the country affordeth. If any of the Saracens have no family in Arabia, th=

umph was marked by a mortality of men and cattle; and twenty-five thousand =
Saracens were snatched away from the possession of Syria. The death of Abu =

of the attempt and the value of the prize. From the throne of Medina, the e=

Arabian tribes and the veterans of Syria; and the merit of an holy war was =
recommended by the peculiar fame and fertility of Egypt. Anxious for the ru=

 patriarch observes that the Saracens fought with the courage of lions; the=

assaulted in their turn the walls and towers of the city. In every attack, =
the sword, the banner of Amrou glittered in the van of the Moslems. On a me=
morable day, he was betrayed by his imprudent valour: his followers who had=
 entered the citadel were driven back; and the general, with a friend and a=
 slave, remained a prisoner in the hands of the Christians. When Amrou was =
conducted before the prefect, he remembered his dignity and forgot his situ=

enterprise, perhaps of easy execution, must have seemed extravagant to vulg=

wrongs: at the court of Damascus, the proceedings of Musa were blamed, his =
intentions were suspected, and his delay in complying with the first invita=
tion was chastised by an harsher and more peremptory summons. An intrepid m=
essenger of the caliph entered his camp at Lugo in Gallicia, and in the pre=
sence of the Saracens and Christians arrested the bridle of his horse. His =
own loyalty, or that of his troops, inculcated the duty of obedience; and h=
is disgrace was alleviated by the recall of his rival, and the permission o=

or even at thirty, thousand persons. As soon as he reached Tiberias in Pale=
stine, he was apprised of the sickness and danger of the caliph, by a priva=
te message from Soliman, his brother and presumptive heir; who wished to re=
serve for his own reign the spectacle of victory. Had Walid recovered, the =
delay of Musa would have been criminal: he pursued his march, and found an =
enemy on the throne. In his trial before a partial judge, against a popular=
 antagonist, he was convicted of vanity and falsehood; and a fine of two hu=
ndred thousand pieces of gold either exhausted his poverty or proved his ra=
paciousness. The unworthy treatment of Tarik was revenged by a similar indi=
gnity; and the veteran commander, after a public whipping, stood a whole da=

 the pious name of a pilgrimage to Mecca. The resentment of the caliph migh=

widow of Roderic, offended the prejudices both of the Christians and Moslem=

 formidable host, in the full confidence of surmounting all opposition, eit=

motive of private or public interest, devoted his beauteous daughter to the=
 embraces of the African misbeliever. But the strongest fortresses of Cerda=
gne were invested by a superior force; the rebel was overtaken and slain in=
 the mountains; and his widow was sent a captive to Damascus, to gratify th=
e desires, or more probably the vanity, of the commander of the faithful. F=
rom the Pyrenees Abderame proceeded without delay to the passage of the Rho=
ne and the siege of Arles. An army of Christians attempted the relief of th=
e city; the tombs of their leaders were yet visible in the thirteenth centu=

eam into the Mediterranean sea. The arms of Abderame were not less successf=

ordogne, which unite their waters in the gulf of Bordeaux; but he found, be=
yond those rivers, the camp of the intrepid Eudes, who had formed a second =
army, and sustained a second defeat, so fatal to the Christians that, accor=

Besan=C3=A7on. The memory of these devastations, for Abderame did not spare=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_366">The emperor Theophilus, son of Michael the Sta=

 Constantinople during the middle age. In offensive or defensive war, he ma=
rched in person five times against the Saracens, formidable in his attack, =
esteemed by the enemy in his losses and defeats. In the last of these exped=
itions he penetrated into Syria, and besieged the obscure town of Sozopetra=
: the casual birth-place of the caliph Motassem, whose father Harun was att=
ended in peace or war by the most favourite of his wives and concubines. Th=
e revolt of a Persian impostor employed at that moment the arms of the Sara=
cen, and he could only intercede in favour of a place for which he felt and=
 acknowledged some degree of filial affection. These solicitations determin=
ed the emperor to wound his pride in so sensible a part. Sozopetra was leve=
lled with the ground, the Syrian prisoners were marked or mutilated with ig=
nominious cruelty, and a thousand female captives were forced away from the=
 adjacent territory. Among these a matron of the house of Abbas invoked, in=
 an agony of despair, the name of Motassem; and the insults of the Greeks e=

appeal. Under the reign of <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Ed=

sellors to evacuate Amorium, to remove the inhabitants, and to abandon the =
empty structures to the vain resentment of the Barbarians. The emperor embr=
aced the more generous resolution of defending, in a siege and battle, the =
country of his ancestors. When the armies drew near, the front of the Mahom=
etan line appeared to a Roman eye more closely planted with spears and jave=
lins; but the event of the action was not glorious on either side to the na=
tional troops. The Arabs were broken, but it was by the swords of thirty th=
ousand Persians, who had obtained service and settlement in the Byzantine e=
mpire. The Greeks were repulsed and vanquished, but it was by the arrows of=
 the Turkish cavalry; and, had not their bow-strings been damped and relaxe=
d by the evening rain, very few of the Christians could have escaped with t=
he emperor from the field of battle. They breathed at Doryl=C3=A6um, at the=
 distance of three days; and Theophilus, reviewing his trembling squadrons,=
 forgave the common flight both of the prince and people. After this discov=
ery of his weakness, he vainly hoped to deprecate the fate of Amorium: the =
inexorable caliph rejected with contempt his prayers and promises; and deta=
ined the Roman ambassadors to be the witnesses of his great revenge. They h=
ad nearly been the witnesses of his shame. The vigorous assaults of fifty-f=

 desperate people; and the Saracens must have raised the siege if a domesti=
c traitor had not pointed to the weakest part of the wall, a place which wa=
s decorated with the statues of a lion and a bull. The vow of Motassem was =

 grief and remorse, we may allow some pity to a parricide, who exclaimed, i=

o come. After this act of treason, the ensigns of royalty, the garment and =
walking staff of Mahomet, were given and torn away by the foreign mercenari=

 their dignity, a short reprieve of inevitable fate.<a href=3D"https://oll.=

 fifth of their substance and spoil; the most flagitious sins were no more =
than the type of disobedience; and the brethren were united and concealed b=

of silver and gold. But the walls of the city withstood the strokes of thei=

 the most ample revenue, the most flourishing and populous state. With the =
decline and fall of the empire, the cities of the West had decayed and fall=
en; nor could the ruins of Rome, or the mud walls, wooden hovels, and narro=
w precincts of Paris and London, prepare the Latin stranger to contemplate =
the situation and extent of Constantinople, her stately palaces and churche=
s, and the arts and luxury of an innumerable people. Her treasures might at=
tract, but her virgin strength had repelled, and still promised to repel, t=
he audacious invasion of the Persian and Bulgarian, the Arab and the Russia=
n. The provinces were less fortunate and impregnable; and few districts, fe=
w cities, could be discovered which had not been violated by some fierce Ba=
rbarian, impatient to despoil, because he was hopeless to possess. From the=
 age of Justinian the Eastern empire was sinking below its former level; th=
e powers of destruction were more active than those of improvement; and the=
 calamities of war were embittered by the more permanent evils of civil and=
 ecclesiastical tyranny. The captive who had escaped from the Barbarians wa=
s often stripped and imprisoned by the ministers of his sovereign: the Gree=
k superstition relaxed the mind by prayer and emaciated the body by fasting=
; and the multitude of convents and festivals diverted many hands and many =
days from the temporal service of mankind. Yet the subjects of the Byzantin=
e empire were still the more dexterous and diligent of nations; their count=
ry was blessed by nature with every advantage of soil, climate, and situati=
on; and, in the support <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Editi=

aceful temper was more useful than the warlike spirit and feudal anarchy of=
 Europe. The provinces that still adhered to the empire were repeopled and =
enriched by the misfortunes of those which were irrecoverably lost. From th=
e yoke of the caliphs, the Catholics of Syria, Egypt, and Africa retired to=
 the allegiance of their prince, to the society of their brethren: the move=
able wealth, which eludes the search of oppression, accompanied and allevia=
ted their exile; and Constantinople received into her bosom the fugitive tr=
ade of Alexandria and Tyre. The chiefs of Armenia and Scythia, who fled fro=
m hostile or religious persecution, were hospitably entertained; their foll=
owers were encouraged to build new cities and to cultivate waste lands; and=
 many spots, both in Europe and Asia, preserved the name, the manners, or a=
t least the memory of these national colonies. Even the tribes of Barbarian=
s, who had seated themselves in arms on the territory of the empire, were g=
radually reclaimed to the laws of the church and state; and, as long as the=
y were separated from the Greeks, their posterity supplied a race of faithf=
ul and obedient soldiers. Did we possess sufficient materials to survey the=
 twenty-nine themes of the Byzantine monarchy, our curiosity might be satis=

mbassadors of the nations, more especially of the unbelieving nations, were=
 solemnly admonished that such strange alliances had been condemned by the =
founder of the church and city. The irrevocable law was inscribed on the al=
tar of St. Sophia; and the impious prince who should stain the majesty of t=
he purple was excluded from the civil and ecclesiastical communion of the R=
omans. If the ambassadors were instructed by any false brethren in the Byza=

 of this imaginary law: the marriage of Leo, or rather of his father, Const=
antine the Fourth, with the daughter of the king of the Chozars, the nuptia=
ls of the grand-daughter of Romanus with a Bulgarian prince, and the union =
of Bertha of France or Italy with young Romanus, the son of Constantine Por=
phyrogenitus himself. To these objections three answers were prepared, whic=
h solved the difficulty and established the law. I. The deed and the guilt =
of Constantine Copronymus were acknowledged. The Isaurian heretic, who sull=
ied the baptismal font and declared war against the holy images, had indeed=
 embraced a Barbarian wife. By this impious alliance he accomplished the me=
asure of his crimes, and was devoted to the just censure of the church and =
of posterity. II. Romanus could not be alleged as a legitimate emperor; he =
was a plebeian usurper, ignorant of the laws, and regardless of the honour,=
 of the monarchy. His son Christopher, the father of the bride, was the thi=
rd in rank in the college of princes, at once the subject and the accomplic=
e of a rebellious parent. The Bulgarians were sincere and devout Christians=
; and the safety of the empire, with the redemption of many thousand captiv=
es, depended on this preposterous alliance. Yet no consideration could disp=
ense from the law of Constantine: the clergy, the senate, and the people di=
sapproved the conduct of Romanus; and he was reproached, both in his life a=
nd death, as the author of the public disgrace. III. For the marriage of hi=
s own son with the daughter of Hugo, king of Italy, a <span class=3D"pb"><s=

lords of each castle were compelled to assume the character of princes and =
warriors. To their own courage and policy they boldly trusted for the safet=

injuries; and, like the conquerors of a larger size, they were too apt to t=
ransgress the privilege of defensive war. The powers of the mind and body w=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_401">Vague and false ideas prevailed concerning Sab=
ianism, until the obscure subject was illuminated by the labours of Chwolso=
hn and Petermann in the present century. Gibbon does not fall into the gros=
ser, though formerly not uncommon, error of confusing the Sabians with the =
Sabaeans (of Yemen); the two names begin with different Arabic letters. But=
 in his day the distinction had not been discovered between the true Sabian=
s of Babylonia and the false Sabians of Harran. The first light on the matt=
er was thrown by Norberg=E2=80=99s publication of the Sacred Book of the Sa=
bians entitled Sidra Rabba, =E2=80=9CGreat Book,=E2=80=9D which he edited u=
nder the name of the Book of Adam (or Codex Nasiraeus). But the facts about=
 the two Sabianisms were first clearly established in Chwolsohn=E2=80=99s w=
ork, Ssabier und Ssabismus (1856).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_402">This book is mainly concerned with an account =
of the false Sabians of Harran. It was in the 9th century <span class=3D"sc=
"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> that this spurious Sabianism w=
as so named. The people of Harran, in order not to be accounted heathen by =
their Abb=C4=81sid lords, but that they might be reckoned among the unbelie=
vers to whom a privileged position is granted by the Koran =E2=80=94 Jews, =
Christians, and Sabians =E2=80=94 as they could not pretend to be Christian=
s or Jews, professed Sabianism, a faith to which no exact idea was attached=
. The religion, which thus assumed the Sabian name, was the native religion=
 of the country, with Greek and Syrian elements super-imposed. It is to thi=
s spurious Sabianism, with its star-worship, that Gibbon=E2=80=99s descript=
ion applies.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_403">The true Sabianism sprang up in Babylonia in t=
he 1st and 2nd centuries of the Christian era, and probably contains as its=
 basis misunderstood gnostic doctrines. Its nature was first clearly explai=
ned by Petermann, who travelled for the purpose of studying it, and then re=
-edited the Sidra Rabba, which is written in a Semitic dialect known as Man=
daean. There were two original principles: matter, and a creative mind (=E2=
=80=9Cthe lord of glory=E2=80=9D). This primal mental principle creates Hay=
ya Kadmaya (=E2=80=9Cfirst life=E2=80=9D), and then <span class=3D"pb"><spa=

holding the lord of glory, after death. The emanation Hayya Kadmaya is the =
deity who is worshipped; from him other emanations proceed. (For the ceremo=
nies and customs of modern Sabians see M. Siouffi=E2=80=99s Etudes sur la r=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_408">Papyri discovered in Egypt throw some interest=
ing light on the position of the Copt Mokaukas (al-Mukaukis), famous for hi=
s correspondence with Mohammad and for the part he played in the Saracen co=

ist de Goeje (1885), and had engaged the special attention of Ranke (Weltge=
schichte, vol. v. p. 140 <i>sqq.</i>); but the investigation of Prof. J. Ka=
rabacek, the editor of the Mittheilungen from the collection of the Archduk=

e: =E2=80=94</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_409">The proper name of Mokaukas (al-Mukaukis) was =
George, and he was the son of Menas Parkabios, an instance of a Copt with a=
 double name (Greek and Coptic), of which there are constant examples in pa=
pyri. At this time Egypt had three eparchies, each under a dux; each eparch=
y was divided into several nomes under strat=C3=AAgoi. The financial admini=
stration of the nome was in the hands of a pagarch. Sometimes the offices o=
f the strat=C3=AAgos and pagarch were united; and Mokaukas combined the dou=
ble functions. But it seems that though he was always connected with the ep=
archy of Lower Egypt, he was not throughout his whole career pagarch of the=
 same nome. For we find him at Alexandria as well as at Misr (Babylon). In =
<span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 628 H=C4=81ti=
b, the envoy of Mohammad, found him governor of Alexandria. In Bil=C4=81dhu=
r=C4=AB he appears as governor first of Alexandria and afterwards of Misr. =
Eutychius and Elmacin represent him as an <i>=C4=80mil</i> set by Heraclius=
 over the taxes in Misr. There is no question that at the time of the Sarac=
en invasion his official residence was Misr. Karabacek thinks that the name=
 <i>Mokaukis</i> is a corruption of =CE=BC=CE=B5=CE=B3=CE=B1=CF=85=CF=87=CE=
=AE=CF=82, which <i>might have been</i> one of his titles, since we find ap=

<p class=3D"indent-no" id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_414">Clinton (Fasti Romani, ii.=
 p. 173-5) has also adopted this scheme. But it must certainly be rejected.=
 (1) Gibbon has himself noticed a difficulty concerning the length of the s=
iege of Damascus, in connection with the battle of Ajn=C4=81dain (see p. 14=
6, n. 73). (2) The date given for that battle, Friday, July 13, <span class=
=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 633 (Ockley, i. p. 65), =
is inconsistent with the fact that July 13 in that year fell on Tuesday. (3=
) The battle of the Yerm=C5=ABk took place without any doubt in August, 634=
. This is proved by the notice of Arabic authors that it was synchronous wi=
th the death of Ab=C5=AB Bekr; combined with the date of Theophanes (<i>sub=
</i> <span class=3D"sc">a.m.</span> 6126), =E2=80=9CTuesday, the 23rd of Lo=
us (that <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Pa=
ge: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>378<span class=3D"bracket">]</sp=
an></span> is, August),=E2=80=9D which was the day after Ab=C5=AB Bekr=E2=
=80=99s death. The chronology of Theophanes is confused in this period; the=
re is a discrepancy between the Anni Incarnationis and Indications on one h=
and, and the Anni Mundi on the other; and the Anni Mundi are generally a ye=
ar wrong. So in this case, the Annus Mundi 6126 (=3D March 25, <span class=
=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 633 to 634) ought to be =
6127; the 23rd of Lous fell on Tuesday in 634, not in 633 or 635 or 636. Th=
ere is no question about the reading =CE=9B=CF=8E=CE=BF=CF=85, which appear=

n=E2=80=99s chronology precedes the battle of the Yerm=C5=ABk. But it was c=
learly a consequence, as Theophanes represents, as well as the best Arabic =
authorities. Kh=C4=81lid who arrived from Ir=C4=81k just in time to take pa=
rt in the battle of the Yerm=C5=ABk led the siege of Damascus. See Tabar=C4=
=AB, ed. Kosegarten, ii. p. 161 <i>sqq.</i> (5) The date of the capture of =
Damascus was Ann. Hij 13 according to Mas=C5=ABd=C4=AB and Ab=C5=AB-l-Fid=
=C4=81, in winter (Tabar=C4=AB); hence Weil deduces Jan. <span class=3D"sc"=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_415">On these grounds Weil revised the chronology, =
in the light of better Arabic sources. He rightly placed the battle of the =
Yerm=C5=ABk in Aug. 634, and the capture of Damascus subsequent to it. The =
engagement of Ajn=C4=81dain he placed shortly before that of the Yerm=C5=AB=
k, on July 30, <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span=
> 634, but had to assume that Kh=C4=81lid was not present. As to the battle=
 of Cadesia, he accepts the year given by Tabar=C4=AB (tr. Zotenberg, iii.,=
 p. 400) and Mas=C5=ABd=C4=AB (<span class=3D"sc">a.h.</span> 14, <span cla=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_417">The weak point in Weil=E2=80=99s reconstructio=

The battle of the Yerm=C5=ABk on the east of the Jordan naturally preceded =
operations west of the Jordan. This has been pointed out by Sir W. Muir (An=

y Ab=C5=AB-l-Fid=C4=81, while other Arabic sources place it in the followin=

 the Anni Incarnationis and interpret the <span class=3D"sc">a.m.</span> as=
 March, 635-636. In that case, the capitulation would have taken place at e=
arliest in March, 637 =E2=80=94 if the <i>two</i> years were interpreted st=

get over this. There are two other candidates for the authorship: (1) Sylve=
ster, abbot of St. Michael, who states, at the end of the Chronicle in the =
Laurentian MS., that he =E2=80=9Cwrote these books of annals=E2=80=9D in <s=
pan class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 1116; as long a=
s Nestor was regarded as the author, the word for <i>wrote</i> was interpre=
ted as <i>copied</i> (though a different compound is usually employed in th=
at sense), but Golubinski and Kostomarov have proposed to regard the abbot =
as the author and not a mere copyist; (2) the monk Basil who is mentioned i=
n the story of Vasilko (c. 82), and speaks there in the first person: =E2=
=80=9CI went to find Vasilko.=E2=80=9D But this may be explained by supposi=
ng that the compiler of the chronicle has mechanically copied, without maki=
ng the necessary change of person, a relation of the episode of Vasilko wri=
tten by this Basil. The authorship of the chronicle is not solved; we can o=
nly say that the compiler was a monk of the Peshtcherski monastery of Kiev.=

ght in rejecting the guess of Cl=C3=A9ment the Benedictine that the histori=
an is to be identified with Hugo Foucault, Abbot of St. Denis (from 1186-11=
97). In the first place Foucault would never be Latinised as Falcandus. In =
the second place, the only plausible evidence for the identification does n=
ot bear examination. It is a letter of Peter of Blois to an abbot H. of St.=
 Denys (Opera. ed. Giles, ep. 116, i. p. 178), in which Peter asks his corr=
espondent to send him a <i>tractatus quem de statu aut potius de casu vestr=
o in Sicilia descripsistis.</i> But this description does not apply to the =
Historia Sicula of Falcandus, and it has been shown by Schroter that the co=
rrespondent of Peter is probably not Hugo Foucault, but his successor in th=
e abbacy, Hugo of Mediolanum. Schroter has fully refuted this particular id=
entification, and has also refuted the view (held by Amari, Freeman, and ot=
hers) that Falcandus was a Norman or Frank. On the contrary Falcandus was p=
robably born in Sicily, which he knew well, especially Palermo, and when he=
 wrote his history, he was living not north of the Alps (for he speaks of t=
he Franks, &amp;c., as <i>transalpini, transmontani</i>) but in southern It=
aly. He wrote his Historia Sicula, which reaches from 1154 to 1169, later t=
han 1169, probably (in part at least) after 1181, for he speaks (p. 272, ed=
. Muratori) of Alexander III. as <i>qui</i> tunc <i>Romanae praesidebat ecc=
lesiae,</i> and Alexander died in 1181 (F. Schroter, =C3=9Cber die Heimath =
des Hugo Falcandus, 1880). The letter to Peter of Palermo which is prefixed=
 to the History as a sort of dedication seems to have been a perfectly inde=
pendent composition, written immediately after the death of William the Goo=

Boemund, across the Illyric peninsula, and shared their fortunes till the e=

the Proven=C3=A7als, with whom he went on to Jerusalem. He was not an eccle=
siastic like most authors of the age, but a knight. He wrote his history fr=
om time to time, during the crusade, according as he had leisure. It falls =
into eight divisions, each concluded by <i>Amen;</i> and these divisions se=

 any artistic or logical distribution of the work. Having finished his book=
 at Jerusalem, the author deposited it there =E2=80=94 perhaps in the Churc=

copied by pilgrims of an inquiring turn of mind. The author was a pious and=
 enthusiastic crusader, genuinely interested in the religious object of the=
 enterprise; he entirely sinks his own individuality, and identifies himsel=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_500">The chronicle of <span class=3D"csc">Albert</s=

t. The story is told vividly, uninterrupted by any reflections on the part =
of the author; who is profoundly impressed by the marvellous character of t=
he tale which he has to tell; has no scruple in reporting inconsistent stat=

But the canon of Aachen, who compiled the work as we have it, in the third =

the greatest of the historians of the Crusades and one of the greatest hist=

time of Mohammad (see his Prologue to the History of the Crusades). He was =
always in close contact with the public affairs of the kingdom of Jerusalem=

=80=99s</span> Conquest of Constantinople is, along with Nicetas, the main =
guide of Gibbon in his account of the Fourth Crusade. Gibbon thought, and i=
t has been generally thought till late years, that this famous book, compos=
ed by one of the wisest and most moderate of the Crusaders, was a perfectly=
 na=C4=ABve and candid narrative, partial indeed to the conduct of the conq=
uerors, but still =E2=80=94 when allowance has been made for the point of v=
iew =E2=80=94 a faithful relation of facts without an <i>arri=C3=A8re pens=
=C3=A9e.</i> But, though there are some, like his editor M. de Wailly, who =
still maintain the unblemished candour of Villehardouin as an author, recen=
t criticism in the light of new evidence leaves hardly room for reasonable =
doubt that Villehardouin=E2=80=99s work was deliberately intended to deceiv=
e the European public as to the actual facts of the Fourth Crusade. There c=
an be no question that Villehardouin was behind the scenes; he represents t=
he expedition against Constantinople as an accidental diversion, which was =
never intended when the Crusade was organised; and therefore his candour ca=
n be rescued only by proving that the episode of Constantinople was really =
nothing more than a diversion. But the facts do not admit of such an interp=
retation. During the year which elapsed between the consent of the Venetian=
 Republic to transport the Crusaders and the time when the Crusaders assemb=
led at Venice (<span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span=
> 1201-2), the two most important forces concerned in the enterprise =E2=80=
=94 Venice and Boniface of Montferrat =E2=80=94 had determined to divert th=
e Crusade from its proper and original purpose. Venice had determined that,=
 wherever the knights sailed, they should <i>not</i> sail to the place whit=
her she had undertaken to transport them, namely to the shores of Egypt. Fo=
r in the course of that eventful year she made a treaty with the Sultan of =
Egypt, pledging herself that Egypt should not be invaded. And on his part, =
Boniface of Montferrat had arranged with the Emperor Philip and Alexius tha=
t the swords of the Crusaders should be employed at Constantiople. (For all=
 this see vol. x. p. 350-1, n. 51 and 53, and p. 354, n. 63.) On these fact=
s, which were of the first importance, Villehardouin says not a word; and o=
ne cannot hesitate to conclude that his silence is deliberate. In fact, his=
 book is, as has been said, an =E2=80=9Cofficial=E2=80=9D version of the di=
sgraceful episode. The Fourth Crusade shocked public opinion in Europe; men=
 asked how such a thing had befallen, how the men who had gone forth to do =
battle against the infidels had been drawn aside from their pious purpose t=
o attack Christian states. The story of Villehardouin, a studied suppressio=
n of the truth, was the answer. [Mm. Mas-Latrie and Riant take practically =
this point of view, which has been presented well and moderately by Mr. Pea=
rs in his Fall of Constantinople (an excellent work). M. J. Tessier, La div=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_527">=E2=80=9CIt took the Arabs half a century to d=
iscover the need of a separate coinage of their own. At first they were con=
tent to borrow their gold and copper currency from the Byzantine Empire, wh=
ich they had driven out of Syria, and their silver coins from the Sassanian=
 kings of Persia, whom they had overthrown at the battles of Kadisia and Ne=
havend. The Byzantine gold served them till the seventy-sixth year of the F=
light, when a new, but theologically unsound and consequently evanescent, t=
ype was invented, bearing the effigy of the reigning Khalif instead of that=
 of Heraclius, and Arabic instead of Greek inscriptions. So, too, the Sassa=
nian silver pieces were left unaltered, save for the addition of a governor=
=E2=80=99s name in Pehlvi letters. The Khalif =E2=80=99Aly or one of his li=
eutenants seems to have attempted to inaugurate a purely Muslim coinage, ex=
actly resembling that which was afterwards adopted, but only one example of=
 this issue is known to exist, in the Paris collection, together with three=
 other silver coins struck at Damascus and Merv between <span class=3D"sc">=
a.h.</span> 60 and 70, of a precisely similar type. These four coins are cl=
early early and ephemeral attempts at the introduction of a distinctive Moh=
ammadan coinage, and their recent discovery in no way upsets the received M=
uslim tradition that it was the Khalif =E2=80=99Abd-El-Melik who, in the ye=
ar of the Flight 76 (or, on the evidence of the coins themselves, 77), inau=
gurated the regular Muslim coinage which was thenceforward issued from all =
the mints of the empire, so long as the dynasty endured, and which gave its=
 general character to the whole currency of the kingdoms of Islam. The copp=
er coinage founded on the Byzantine passed through more and earlier phases =
than the gold and silver, but it always held [an] insignificant place in th=

<p class=3D"indent-no" id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_533">We have to consider first =
how this system originated, and secondly how it developed into the system o=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_534">The identification of the strat=C3=AAgoi of th=
e seventh century with the magistri militum of the sixth century gives the =
clue to the origin of the thematic system. (This was pointed out in Bury=E2=
=80=99s Later Roman Empire, ii. 346-8.) The strat=C3=AAgos of the Armeniacs=
 is the magister militum of Armenia, instituted by Justinian; the strat=C3=

rat=C3=AAgos of Thrace is the mag. mil. per Thraciam; the strat=C3=AAgos of=
 the Helladics is probably the representative of the mag. mil. per Illyricu=
m. The magistri militum of Africa and Italy remain under the title of exarc=
hs. The maritime provinces arose probably, as M. Diehl attractively suggest=
s, from the province of Caria, Cyprus, Rhodes, the Cyclades and Scythia, in=
stituted by Justinian, and placed by him under a quaestor Justinianus.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_535">Thus, what happened was this. In the seventh c=
entury the old system of dioceses and provinces was swept away. Its place w=
as taken by the already existing division of the Empire into military provi=
nces =E2=80=94 the spheres of the magistri militum; and a new Greek nomencl=
ature was <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; P=
age: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>401<span class=3D"bracket">]</s=
pan></span> introduced. The cause of the change was the extreme peril of th=
e Empire from the Saracens. The needs of defence suggested a military organ=
isation; when the frontier was reduced and every province was exposed to th=
e attacks of the enemy, there was a natural tendency to unite civil and mil=
itary power. In the west, the exarch of Africa and the exarch of Italy are =
the magistri militum who have got into their hands the power of the Praetor=
ian prefects of Africa and Italy respectively; and in the same way in the e=
ast, the strat=C3=AAgoi of Thrace, the Anatolics, the Armeniacs, and the Op=
sikians have each a parcel of the prerogatives of the Praetorian Prefect of=
 the East.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_536">During the eighth and ninth centuries the prov=
inces came to be generally called themes, and the list was modified in seve=
ral ways. (1) It was reduced by losses of territory; thus Africa was lost. =
(2) Some of the large provinces were broken up into a number of smaller. (3=
) Some small frontier districts, which were called <i>clisurarchies</i> (=
=CE=BA=CE=BB=CE=B5=CE=B9=CF=83=CE=BF=CE=BD=CC=82=CF=81=CE=B1, a mountain pa=
ss), and had been dependent on one of the large districts, were raised to t=
he dignity of independent themes. Thus the Bucellarian theme was formed in =
the north of Asia Minor between the Opsikian and the Armeniac themes. Then =
Paphlagonia was cut out as a separate province. The Thracesian theme was cu=
t off the Anatolic. The Marine theme ultimately became three: the Cibyrrhae=
ot,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-dec=
line-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-9#lf0214-09_footnote_nt_767" id=3D"lf=

e theme of Samos, and the Aegean Sea. The Helladic province was divided int=
o three (at least): Hellas, Nicopolis, and the Peloponnesus. The Dalmatian =
towns were constituted into a separate district; a separate theme seems to =
have been formed out of Calabria and the Ionian islands; but these islands =
were subsequently detached and constituted as the theme of Cephallenia. In =
the east of Asia Minor: Colonea, Lycandos, Sebastea, &amp;c. The Armeniac a=
nd Anatolic provinces were abridged by the creation of the themes of Charsi=
anon and Cappadocia.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_537">We can trace in the chronicles some changes of=
 this kind which were carried out between the seventh and the tenth centuri=
es But it is not till the beginning of the tenth century that we get any of=
ficial list to give us a general view of the divisions of the Empire. The t=
reatise on the themes by the Emperor Constantine (see above, p. 320 <i>sqq.=
</i>), composed about <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span=
></span> 934, is generally taken as the basis of investigation, and, when h=
istorians feel themselves called upon to give a list of the Byzantine theme=
s, they always quote his. In my opinion this is a mistake. We possess bette=
r lists than Constantine=E2=80=99s, of a somewhat earlier date. Emperor tho=
ugh Constantine was, his list is not official; it is a concoction, in which=
 actual facts are blended with unmethodical antiquarian research. His treat=
ise is valuable indeed; but it should be criticised in the light of the <i>=
official</i> lists which we possess.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_538">(1) The earliest list is one included in the C=
letorologion of Philotheus (see above, p. 383): Const. Porph. De Cer. Bk. i=
i. c. 52, p. 713-14 and 727-8. The strat=C3=AAgoi of the themes are enumera=
ted with other officials in their order of precedence. The list used by Phi=
lotheus must date from the first years of the tenth century; it does not me=
ntion the themes of Langobardia and Sebastea, which existed before the deat=
h of Leo VI., but Cephallenia, which he created, appears in the enumeration=
.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decli=

is included in c. 50 of the Second Book of the De Cerimoniis. But its edito=
r lived in the reign of Romanus I. For he speaks of the governors of Sebast=
ea, Lycandos, Seleucia, Leontocomis, as having been <i>at that time,</i> th=
at is in Leo=E2=80=99s reign, clisurarchs (=E1=BD=A1=CF=82 =E1=BD=A3=CE=BD =
=CF=84=CF=8C=CF=84=CE=B5 =CE=BA=CE=BB=CE=B5=CE=B9=CF=83=CE=BF=CF=85=CF=81=
=CE=AC=CF=81=CF=87=CE=B7=CF=82). In other words, a list was used in which t=
hese four districts appeared as clisurarchies. Subsequently they were made =
themes (strategiai) and the editor brought them up to date. But the list on=
 which he worked seems to be later than the list used by Philotheus, for it=
 includes the theme of Langobardia.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_540">(3) Incomplete enumerations of the themes, in =
the reign of Romanus I., are given by some Arabic writers, especially by Ib=
n Khordadbeh (see M. Rambaud, L=E2=80=99empire grec, p. 182).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_541">(4) The Treatise on the Themes. We must critic=
ise Constantine for including Sicily and Cyprus, which did not belong to th=
e Empire, and at the same time omitting Dalmatia, where there was the sembl=
ance of a province. Constantine raises the Optimaton to the dignity of a th=
eme, but apologises for doing so; it is only a quasi-theme. In this he was =
justified; for, though the Optimaton was not governed by a strat=C3=AAgos b=
ut by a domesticus, and was not in a line with the other themes, it was a g=
eographical province.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_542">But the most serious matter that calls for cri=
ticism is Constantine=E2=80=99s inconsistency in stating definitely that Ch=
arsianon and Cappadocia are themes, and yet not enumerating them in his lis=
t. He discusses them under the heading of the Armeniac theme, but they shou=
ld have headings of their own. This unaccountable procedure has led to the =
supposition that these two themes were temporarily merged in the Armeniac, =
out of which they had originally been evolved.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_543">(5) A number of notices in the treatise de Adm=
inistratione supply material for reconstructing a list of the themes c. <sp=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_544">(6) To these sources must be added, the seals =

 neighbouring peoples may be eluded. (3) He will give a geographical and et=

 the condition and administration of the Empire. This programme is followed=

reason to maintain a powerful navy. The Mediterranean, though all its coast=
s were not part of the Empire, was practically once more an Imperial lake. =

econd half of the seventh century, when the Saracens took to the sea. The E=

nt; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>407<span class=3D"bracket"=

 power. Consequently a new naval organisation was planned and carried out; =
and we must impute the merit of this achievement to the successors of Herac=
lius. We have indeed no notices, in any of our authorities, of the creation=
 of the Imperial navies, but it is clear that the new system had been estab=
lished before the days of Anastasius III. and Leo III. Under Basil I. and h=
is son the naval organisation was remodelled and improved; the settlement o=
f the Saracens in Crete, and their incursions in the Aegean, were facts whi=
ch urgently forced the Emperors to look to their ships. From this time till=
 the latter part of the eleventh century, the fleets of the Empire were the=
 strongest in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_551">There were two fleets, the Imperial and the Pr=
ovincial (Thematic). Until the time of Basil, the Imperial fleet seems not =
to have been organised as a standing force. A system seems to have been est=
ablished whereby, in case Constantinople itself were threatened, a squadron=
 of vessels could be got together for its defence without much delay. This =
was managed by an arrangement with the shipowners of the capital; but as to=
 the nature of this arrangement (it seems to have been a sort of =E2=80=9Ci=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_554">The causes of the decay of the Byzantine navy =
in the eleventh century have been studied by C. Neumann, in the essay cited=
 above. He shows that the antimilitary policy of the emperors in the third =
quarter of that century affected the navy as well as the army (cp. above, v=
ol. viii. p. 282, n. 67). But the main cause was the Selj=C5=ABk conquest. =
It completely disorganised the themes which furnished the contingents of th=
e Provincial fleet. In the 12th century the Emperors depended on the navy o=
f Venice, which they paid by commercial privileges.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_555">The dromonds or biremes were of different size=
s and builds. Thus the largest size might be manned by a crew of 300 or 290=
. Those of a medium size might hold, like the old Greek triremes, about 200=
 men. There were still smaller ones, which, besides a hundred oarsmen who p=
ropelled them, contained only a few officers, steersmen, &amp;c. (perhaps t=
wenty in all). Then there were a special kind of biremes, distinguished by =
build, not by size, called Pamphylians, and probably remarkable for their s=
wiftness. The Emperor Leo in his Tactics directs that the admiral=E2=80=99s=
 ship should be very large and swift and of Pamphylian build.<a href=3D"htt=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_559">All unprejudiced investigators now admit the c=

 there was a very large Slavonic element in the population of the Peloponne=
sus<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-dec=

0214-09_footnote_nt_797_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> Th=
e Slavonic settlements began in the latter half of the sixth century, and i=
n the middle of the eighth century the depopulation caused by the great pla=
gue invited the intrusion of large masses. The general complexion of the pe=
ninsula was so Slavonic that it was called Sclavonia. The only question to =
be determined is, how were these strangers distributed, and what parts of t=
he Peloponnesus were Slavised? For answering these questions, the names of =
places are our chief evidence. Here, as in the Slavonic districts which bec=
ame part of Germany, the Slavs ultimately gave up their own language and ex=
erted hardly any sensible influence on the language which they adopted; but=
 they introduced new local names which survived. It was just the reverse, a=
s has been well remarked by Philippson, in the case of the Albanese settler=
s, who in the fourteenth century brought a new ethnical element into the Pe=
loponnesus. The Albanians preserved their own language, but the old local n=
ames were not altered.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_560">Now we find Slavonic names scattered about in =
all parts of the Peloponnesus; but they are comparatively few on the Easter=
n side, in Argolis and Eastern Laconia. They are numerous in Arcadia and Ac=
haia, in Elis, Messenia and Western Laconia. But the existence of Slavonic =
settlements does not prove that the old Hellenic inhabitants were abolished=
 in these districts. In fact we can only say that a large part of Elis, the=
 slopes of Taygetus, and a district in the south of Laconia, were exclusive=
ly given over to the Slavs. Between Megalopolis and Sparta there was an imp=
ortant town, which has completely disappeared, called Veligosti; and this r=
egion was probably a centre of Slavonic settlers.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_561">See the impartial investigation of Dr. A. Phil=
ippson, Zur Ethnographie des Peloponnes in Petermann=E2=80=99s Mittheilunge=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_562">The conversion and Hellenisation of the Slavs =
went on together from the ninth century, and, with the exception of the set=
tlements in Taygetus and the Arcadian mountains, were completed by the twel=
fth century. At the time of the conquest of the Peloponnesus by Villehardou=
in, four ethnical elements are distinguished by Philippson: (1) Remains of =
the old Hellenes, mixed with Slavs, in Maina and Tzakonia, (2) Byzantine Gr=
eeks (<i>i.e.,</i> Byzantinised Hellenes, and settlers from other parts of =
the Empire) in the towns. (3) Greek-speaking Slavo-Greeks (sprung from unio=
ns of Slavs and Greeks). (4) Almost pure Slavs in Arcadia and Taygetus. The=
 2nd and 3rd classes tend to coalesce and ultimately become indistinguishab=
le (except in physiognomy).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_563">The old Greek element lived on purest perhaps =
in the district between Mt. Parnon and the Sea =E2=80=94 Eastern Laconia. T=
he inhabitants came to be called Tzakones and the district Tzakonia; and th=
ey developed a remarkable dialect of their own. They were long supposed to =
be Slavs. See A. Thumb, Die ethnographische Stellung der Zakonen (Indogerm.=
 Forschungen, iv. 195 <i>sqq.,</i> 1894).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-09_564">Fallmerayer, in harmony with his Slavonic theo=
ry, proposed to derive the name <i>Morea</i> from the Slavonic <i>more,</i>=
 sea. This etymology defied the linguistic laws of Slavonic word-formation.=
 Other unacceptable derivations have been suggested, but we have at last go=
t back to the old mulberry, but in a new sense. =E1=BD=81 =CE=9C=CE=BF=CF=
=81=CE=AD=CE=B1=CF=82 is formed from =CE=BC=CE=BF=CF=81=CE=AD=CE=B1, =E2=80=

f mulberry trees=E2=80=9D (=3D =CE=BC=CE=BF=CF=81=CE=B5=CF=8E=CE=BD). We fi=
nd the name first applied to Elis, whence it spread to the whole Peloponnes=
us; and it is a memorial of the extensive cultivation of mulberries for the=
 manufacture of silk. This explanation is due to the learned and scientific=
 Greek philologist, M. G. N. Hatzidak=C3=AAs (Byz. Zeitsch. vol. 2, p. 283 =
<i>sqq.,</i> and vol. 5, p. 341, <i>sqq.</i>).</p>

 Hudson, Geograph. Minor. tom. i.), Diodorus Siculus (tom. i. l. ii. p. 159=

22-1132 [c. 4, 5 <i>sqq.</i>], from Artemidorus), Dionysius (Periegesis, 92=
7-969), Pliny (Hist. Natur. v. 12, vi. 32), and Ptolemy (Descript. et Tabul=

 of Pocock (Specimen Hist. Arabum, p. 125-128), from the Geography of the S=

the Arabia of Abulfeda, the most copious and correct account of the peninsu=

 i. p. 1-248), and Sale (Preliminary Discourse, p 33-56), had accurately st=

he allegiance of the Chagan, but were under the immediate government of loc=
al princes (like the queen of Bokh=C4=81r=C4=81, the tarkhan of Sogdiana). =
At the time of Kutaiba=E2=80=99s conquest, there was an insurrectionary mov=
ement in Transoxiana, of the poor against the rich. (Cp. Cahun, <i>op. cit.=
</i> p. 133-4) The Saracen conquerors most skilfully took advantage of the =
two elements of disunion =E2=80=94 the race hatred between Ir=C4=81n and T=
=C5=ABr=C4=81n, and the political faction; and Kutaiba=E2=80=99s conquest w=
as due as much to intrigue as to force. It must also be observed that to th=
e Nestorian Christians of Transoxiana, Islam (with its ancient history foun=
ded on the Jewish Scripture) was less obnoxious than fire-worship. The chie=
f danger which Kutaiba had to fear was succour to the enemy from the Turks =
of Altai; and a Turkish force actually came in 706; but he managed, by play=
ing upon the credulity of the tarkhan of Sogdiana, to get rid of the formid=
able warriors without fighting a battle. The conquest of Farghana cost more=
 blows than the conquest of Sogdiana. Here the Saracens came into contact w=
ith the Tibetan Buddhists, who had recently revolted against the Emperor of=
 China. Bands of these Tibetan mountaineers crossed the great southern pass=
 to plunder in the lands of the Oxus and Jaxartes. They formed friendly rel=
ations with the Saracens, who in their turn reconnoitred in Kashgharia. It =
would have been a matter of great importance to the Saracens to hold the so=
uthern gate of China, and thus create and command a new route of commerce f=
rom east to west. But this would have taken away the occupation of the Turk=
s, who had hitherto been the intermediates between China and Western Asia, =
holding the northern gate and hindering any one else from holding the south=
ern. Accordingly the Turkish Chagan interfered, and forcibly recalled the T=
ibetans to their allegiance to the Emperor of China. The advance to K=C4=81=

mon Metaphrastes are described by Hankius (de Scriptoribus Byzant. p. 410-4=
60). This biographer of the saints indulged himself in a loose paraphrase o=
f the sense or nonsense of more ancient acts. His Greek rhetoric is again p=
araphrased in the Latin version of Surius, and scarcely a thread can be now=
 visible of the original texture. [The most recent investigations of Vasili=
evski and Ehrhard as to the date of Symeon Metaphrastes confirm the notice =
in the text. He flourished about the middle and second half of the 10th cen=
tury; his hagiographical work was suggested by Constantine Porphyrogennetos=
 and was probably composed during the reign of Nicephorus Phocas. Symeon is=
 doubtless to be identified with Symeon Magister, the chronicler; see above=
, vol. viii. Appendix, p. 404. (Cp. Krumbacher, Gesch. der byz. Litt. p. 20=
0.) Symeon=E2=80=99s work was not original composition; he collected and ed=
ited older works, lives of saints and acts of martyrs; he paraphrased them,=
 improved their style, and adapted them to the taste of his contemporaries,=
 but he did not invent new stories. His Life of Abercius has been strikingl=
y confirmed by the discovery of the original inscription quoted in that lif=
e. The collection of Symeon was freely interpolated and augmented by new li=
ves after his death, and the edition of Migne, P G. 114, 115, 116, does not=
 represent the original work. To determine the compass of that original wor=

as certain from the investigations of Labarte and Bieliaev. There were two =
ways from the Chrysotriklinos (see below, n. 36) to the Hippodrome. By the =
northern part of the palace, the emperor could reach the cathisma at the no=
rth of the Hippodrome; but the (probably) shorter way led through the south=

=80=9D The Justinian opened into the Skyla (a vestibule), from which there =
was a door into the Hippodrome (eastern side); and, as the Justinian ran fr=
om east to west, we can conclude that the Chrysotriklinos, the chief throne=

 was <i>east</i> of the Hippodrome. The other way, which the Emperor follow=

ough the palace of Theophilus (the Trikonchon, see below) and the palace of=
 Daphne. We know the names of all the rooms, &amp;c., through which he pass=

wns represented in the paintings are not high or pyramidal. The diadems of =
the Empresses had not the cross or the pearl pendants. As Gibbon says, it w=
as only the crown and the red boots which distinguished the Emperor; there =
were no distinctively Imperial robes. (1) On great state occasions the Empe=
ror wore a long tunic (not necessarily purple) called a <i>divetesion</i> (=
=CE=B4=CE=B9=CE=B2=CE=B7=CF=84=CE=AE=CF=83=CE=B9=CE=BF=CE=BD); and over it =

=CE=BB=CF=89=CC=82=CF=81=CE=BF=CF=82) wound over the shoulders and round th=
e arms. (2) As a sort of half-dress costume and always when he was riding t=
he Emperor wore a different tunic, simpler and more convenient, called the =
<i>scaramangion</i> (=CF=83=CE=BA=CE=B1=CF=81=CE=B1=CE=BC=CE=AC=CE=B3=CE=B3=
=CE=B9=CE=BF=CE=BD) and over it a lighter cloak (=CF=83=CE=B1=CE=B3=CE=AF=

 (=CE=BA=CE=BF=CE=BB=CF=8C=CE=B2=CE=B9=CE=BF=CE=BD), a tunic with short sle=
eves to the elbow or no sleeves at all, which he wore on some occasions. Al=
