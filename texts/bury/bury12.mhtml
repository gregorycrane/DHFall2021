 Philip, duke of Burgundy, entertained, at Lisle in Flanders, an assembly o=

ustice, which they delivered to the prefect of the city. But every Roman pr=
ejudice was awakened by the name, the language, and the manners of a Barbar=
ian lord. The C=C3=A6sars of Saxony or Franconia were the chiefs of a feuda=
l aristocracy; nor could they exercise the discipline of civil and military=
 power, which alone secures the obedience of a distant people, impatient of=
 servitude, though perhaps incapable of freedom. Once, and once only, in hi=
s life, each emperor, with an army of Teutonic vassals, descended from the =
Alps. I have described the peaceful order of his entry and coronation; but =
that order was commonly disturbed by the clamour and sedition of the Romans=
, who encountered their sovereign as a foreign invader: his departure was a=
lways speedy, and often shameful; and, in the absence of a long reign, his =
authority was insulted, and his name was forgotten. The progress of indepen=
dence in Germany and Italy undermined the foundations of the Imperial sover=
eignty, and the triumph of the popes was the deliverance of Rome.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-12_212">Of her two sovereigns, the emperor had precari=
ously reigned by the right of conquest; but the authority of the pope was f=
ounded on the soft, though more solid, basis of opinion and habit. The remo=
val of a foreign influence restored and endeared the shepherd to his flock.=
 Instead of the arbitrary or venal nomination of a German court, the vicar =
of Christ was freely chosen by the college of cardinals, most of whom were =
either natives or inhabitants of the city. The applause of the magistrates =
and people confirmed his election; and the ecclesiastical power that was ob=
eyed in Sweden and Britain had been ultimately derived from the suffrage of=
 the Romans. The same suffrage gave a prince, as well as a pontiff, to the =
capital. It was universally believed that Constantine had invested the pope=
s with the temporal dominion of Rome; and the boldest civilians, the most p=
rofane <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page=

</span> sceptics, were satisfied with disputing the right of the emperor an=
d the validity of his gift. The truth of the fact, the authenticity of his =
donation, was deeply rooted in the ignorance and tradition of four centurie=
s; and the fabulous origin was lost in the real and permanent effects. The =
name of <i>Dominus,</i> or Lord, was inscribed on the coin of the bishops; =
their title was acknowledged by acclamations and oaths of allegiance; and, =
with the free or reluctant consent of the German C=C3=A6sars, they had long=
 exercised a supreme or subordinate jurisdiction over the city and patrimon=
y of St. Peter. The reign of the popes, which gratified the prejudices, was=
 not incompatible with the liberties of Rome; and a more critical inquiry w=
ould have revealed a still nobler source of their power: the gratitude of a=
 nation, whom they had rescued from the heresy and oppression of the Greek =
tyrant. In an age of superstition, it should seem that the union of the roy=
al and sacerdotal characters would mutually fortify each other, and that th=
e keys of paradise would be the surest pledge of earthly obedience. The san=
ctity of the office might indeed be degraded by the personal vices of the m=
an; but the scandals of the tenth century were obliterated by the austere a=
nd more dangerous virtues of Gregory the Seventh and his successors; and, i=
n the ambitious contests which they maintained for the rights of the church=
, their sufferings or their success must equally tend to increase the popul=
ar veneration. They sometimes wandered in poverty and exile, the victims of=
 persecution; and the apostolic zeal with which they offered themselves to =
martyrdom must engage the favour and sympathy of every Catholic breast. And=
 sometimes, thundering from the Vatican, they created, judged, and deposed =
the kings of the world; nor could the proudest Roman be disgraced by submit=
ting to a priest whose feet were kissed, and whose stirrup was held, by the=
 successors of Charlemagne.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bur=

No criminals were so powerful as to brave, so obscure as to elude, the just=

 provoked for their sake, the Romans were excited to depose and imprison th=
eir benefactor; nor would his life have been spared, if Bologna had not pos=
sessed a pledge for his safety. Before his departure, the prudent senator h=
ad required the exchange of thirty hostages of the noblest families of Rome=

strictly guarded; and Bologna, in the cause of honour, sustained the thunde=

pare the present with the past; and Brancaleone was conducted from the pris=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-12_225">Ambition is a weed of quick and early vegetati=
on in the vineyard of Christ. Under the first Christian princes, the chair =
of St. Peter was disputed by the votes, the venality, the violence, of a po=
pular election; the sanctuaries of Rome were polluted with blood; and, from=
 the third to the twelfth century, the church was distracted by the mischie=
f of frequent schisms. As long as the final appeal was determined by the ci=
vil magistrate, these mischiefs were transient and local; the merits were t=
ried by equity or favour; nor could the unsuccessful competitor long distur=
b the triumph of his rival. But, after the emperors had been divested of th=
eir prerogatives, after a maxim had been established that the vicar of Chri=
st is amenable to no earthly tribunal, each vacancy of the holy see might i=
nvolve Christendom in controversy and war. The claims of the cardinals and =
inferior clergy, of the nobles and people, were vague and litigious; the fr=
eedom of choice was over-ruled by the tumults of a city that no longer owne=
d or obeyed a superior. On the decease of a pope, two factions proceeded, i=
n different churches, to a double election: the number and weight of votes,=
 the priority of time, the merit of the candidates, might balance each othe=
r; the most respectable of the clergy were divided; and the distant princes=
 who bowed before the spiritual throne could not distinguish the spurious f=
rom the legitimate idol. The emperors were often the authors of the schism,=
 from the political motive of opposing a friendly to an hostile pontiff; an=
d each of the competitors was reduced to suffer the insults of his enemies,=
 who were not awed by conscience, and to purchase the support of his adhere=

 a nocturnal assembly of an hundred citizens on Mount Aventine, the first s=
tep to their execution. After an oath of secrecy and aid, he represented to=
 the conspirators the importance and facility of their enterprise; that the=
 nobles, without union or resources, were strong only in the fear of their =
imaginary strength; that all power, as well as right, was in the hands of t=
he people; that the revenues of the apostolical chamber might relieve the p=
ublic distress; and that the pope himself would approve their victory over =
the common enemies of government and freedom. After securing a faithful ban=
d to protect his first declaration, he proclaimed through the city, by soun=
d of trumpet, that on the evening of the following day all persons should a=
ssemble without arms before the church of St. Angelo, to provide for the re=
-establishment of the good estate. The whole night was employed in the cele=
bration of thirty masses of the Holy Ghost; and in the morning, Rienzi, bar=
e-headed, but in complete armour, issued from the church, encompassed by th=
e hundred conspirators. The pope=E2=80=99s vicar, the simple bishop of Orvi=
eto, who had been persuaded to sustain a part in this singular ceremony, ma=
rched on his right hand; and three great standards were borne aloft as the =
emblems of their design. In the first, the banner of <i>liberty,</i> Rome w=
as seated on two lions, with a palm in one hand and a globe in the other; S=
t. Paul, with a drawn sword, was delineated in the banner of <i>justice;</i=
> and in the third, St. Peter held the keys of <i>concord</i> and <i>peace.=
</i> Rienzi was encouraged by the presence and applause of an innumerable c=
rowd, who understood little and hoped much; and the procession slowly rolle=
d forwards from the castle of St. Angelo to the Capitol. His triumph was di=
sturbed by some secret emotion, which he laboured to suppress: he ascended =
without opposition, and with seeming confidence, the citadel of the republi=
c; harangued the people from the balcony; and received the most flattering =
confirmation <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current=

</span></span> of his acts and laws. The nobles, as if destitute of arms an=
d counsels, beheld in silent consternation this strange revolution; and the=
 moment had been prudently chosen, when the most formidable, Stephen Colonn=
a, was absent from the city. On the first rumour he returned to his palace,=
 affected to despise this plebeian tumult, and declared to the messenger of=
 Rienzi that at his leisure he would cast the madman from the windows of th=
e Capitol. The great bell instantly rang an alarm, and so rapid was the tid=
e, so urgent was the danger, that Colonna escaped with precipitation to the=
 suburb of St. Lawrence; from thence, after a moment=E2=80=99s refreshment,=
 he continued the same speedy career, till he reached in safety his castle =
of Palestrina, lamenting his own imprudence, which had not trampled the spa=
rk of this mighty conflagration. A general and peremptory order was issued =
from the Capitol to all the nobles, that they should peaceably retire to th=
eir estates: they obeyed; and their departure secured the tranquillity of t=
he free and obedient citizens of Rome.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-12_236">But such voluntary obedience evaporates with t=
he first transports of zeal; and Rienzi felt the importance of justifying h=
is usurpation by a regular form and a legal title. At his own choice, the R=

ns was the essence of that sacred office; and they were ignorant that it ha=
d never been invested with any share in the legislative or executive powers=
 of the republic. In this character, and with the consent of the Romans, th=
e tribune enacted the most salutary laws for the restoration and maintenanc=
e of the good estate. By the first he fulfils the <span class=3D"pb"><span =
class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket"=
>[</span>134<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> wish of honesty and ine=
xperience, that no civil suit should be protracted beyond the term of fifte=
en days. The danger of frequent perjury might justify the pronouncing again=
st a false accuser the same penalty which his evidence would have inflicted=
; the disorders of the times might compel the legislator to punish every ho=
micide with death and every injury with equal retaliation. But the executio=
n of justice was hopeless till he had previously abolished the tyranny of t=
he nobles. It was formerly provided that none, except the supreme magistrat=
e, should possess or command the gates, bridges, or towers of the state; th=
at no private garrisons should be introduced into the towns or castles of t=
he Roman territory; that none should bear arms or presume to fortify their =
houses in the city or country; that the barons should be responsible for th=
e safety of the highways and the free passage of provisions; and that the p=
rotection of malefactors and robbers should be expiated by a fine of a thou=
sand marks of silver. But these regulations would have been impotent and nu=
gatory, had not the licentious nobles been awed by the sword of the civil p=
ower. A sudden alarm from the bell of the Capitol could still summon to the=
 standard above twenty thousand volunteers; the support of the tribune and =
the laws required a more regular and permanent force. In each harbour of th=
e coast, a vessel was stationed for the assurance of commerce; a standing m=
ilitia of three hundred and sixty horse and thirteen hundred foot was levie=
d, clothed, and paid in the thirteen quarters of the city; and the spirit o=
f a commonwealth may be traced in the grateful allowance of one hundred flo=
rins, or pounds, to the heirs of every soldier who lost his life in the ser=
vice of his country. For the maintenance of the public defence, for the est=
ablishment of granaries, for the relief of widows, orphans, and indigent co=
nvents, Rienzi applied, without fear of sacrilege, the revenues of the apos=
tolic chamber; the three branches of hearth-money, the salt-duty, and the c=

e forces and finances of the republic, the tribune recalled the nobles from=
 their solitary independence; required their personal appearance in the Cap=
itol; and imposed an oath of allegiance to the new government and of submis=
sion to the laws of the good estate. Apprehensive for their safety, but sti=
ll more apprehensive of the danger of a refusal, the princes and barons ret=
urned to their houses at Rome, in the garb of simple and peaceful citizens;=
 the Colonna and Ursini, the Savelli and Frangipani, were confounded before=
 the tribunal of a plebeian, of the vile buffoon whom they had so often der=
ided, and their disgrace was aggravated by the indignation which they vainl=
y struggled to disguise. The same oath was successively pronounced by the s=
everal orders of society, the clergy and gentlemen, the judges and notaries=
, the merchants and artisans, and the gradual descent was marked by the inc=
rease of sincerity and zeal. They swore to live and die with the republic a=
nd the church, whose interest was artfully united by the nominal associatio=
n of the bishop of Orvieto, the pope=E2=80=99s vicar, to the office of trib=
une. It was the boast of Rienzi that he had delivered the throne and patrim=
ony of St. Peter from a rebellious aristocracy; and Clement the Sixth, who =
rejoiced in its fall, affected to believe the professions, to applaud the m=
erits, and to confirm the title of his trusty servant. The speech, perhaps =
the mind, of the tribune was inspired with a lively regard for the purity o=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-12_237">Never, perhaps, has the energy and effect of a=
 single mind been more remarkably felt than in the sudden, though transient=
, reformation of Rome by the tribune Rienzi. A den of robbers was converted=
 to the discipline of a camp or convent: patient to hear, swift to redress,=
 inexorable to punish, his tribunal was always accessible to the poor and s=
tranger; nor could birth or dignity or the immunities of the church protect=
 the offender or his accomplices. The privileged houses, the private sanctu=
aries in Rome, on which no officer of justice would presume to trespass, we=
re abolished; and he applied the timber and iron of their barricades in the=
 fortifications of the Capitol. The venerable father of the Colonna was exp=
osed in his own palace to the double shame of being desirous, and of being =
unable, to protect a criminal. A mule, with a jar of oil, had been stolen n=
ear Capranica; and the lord of the Ursini family was condemned to restore t=
he damage, and to discharge a fine of four hundred florins for his negligen=
ce in guarding the highways. Nor were the persons of the barons more inviol=
ate than their lands or houses; and, either from accident or design, the sa=
me impartial rigour was exercised against the heads of the adverse factions=
. Peter Agapet Colonna, who had himself been senator of Rome, was arrested =
in the street for injury or debt; and justice was appeased by the tardy exe=
cution of Martin Ursini, who, among his various acts of violence and rapine=
, had pillaged a shipwrecked vessel at the mouth of the Tiber.<a href=3D"ht=

 were disregarded by the inflexible tribune, who had chosen his victim. The=
 public officers dragged him from his palace and nuptial bed: his trial was=
 short and satisfactory; the bell of the Capitol convened the people; strip=
t of his mantle, on his knees, with his hands bound behind his back, he hea=
rd the sentence of death; and, after a brief confession, Ursini was led awa=
y to the gallows. After such an example, none who were conscious of guilt c=
ould hope for impunity, and the flight of the wicked, the licentious, and t=
he idle soon purified the city and territory of Rome. In this time (says th=
e historian) the woods began to rejoice that they were no longer infested w=
ith robbers; the oxen began to plough; the pilgrims visited the sanctuaries=
; the roads and inns were replenished with travellers; trade, plenty, and g=
ood faith were restored in the markets; and a purse of gold might be expose=
d without danger in the midst of the highway. As soon as the life and prope=
rty of the subject are secure, the labours and rewards of industry spontane=
ously revive: Rome was still the metropolis of the Christian world; and the=
 fame and fortunes of the tribune were diffused in every country by the str=
angers who had enjoyed the blessings of his government.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-12_238">The deliverance of his country inspired Rienzi=
 with a vast, and perhaps visionary, idea of uniting Italy in a great feder=
ative republic, of which Rome should be the ancient and lawful head, and th=
e free cities and princes the members and associates. His pen was not less =
eloquent than his tongue; and his numerous epistles were delivered to swift=
 and trusty messengers. On foot, with a white wand in their hand, they trav=

 sacred security of ambassadors; and reported, in the style of flattery or =
truth, that the highways along their passage were lined with kneeling multi=
tudes, who implored Heaven for the success of their undertaking. Could pass=

the Barbarians of the North.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bu=

uch ignominious servitude. In the morning they understood their sentence fr=
om the visit of a confessor and the tolling of the bell. The great hall of =
the Capitol had been decorated for the bloody scene with red and white hang=

 executioners were unsheathed; and the barons were interrupted in their dyi=

 to usurp the temporal government of the city. They rose in arms, selected =
seven governors of the republic and a constable of the Capitol; imprisoned =
the pope=E2=80=99s nephews; besieged his person in the palace; and shot vol=

 constancy was exhausted by a rebellion of five months. Under the tyranny o=

hurch; and their repentance was unanimous and effectual. The troops of St. =
Peter again occupied the Capitol; the magistrates departed to their homes; =
the most guilty were executed or exiled; and the legate, at the head of two=
 thousand foot and four thousand horse, was saluted as the father of the ci=

 prolonged his absence: he was received by a submissive people; but the pon=

 The election was annual; a severe scrutiny was instituted into the conduct=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-12_255">It is an obvious truth that the times must be =
suited to extraordinary characters, and that the genius of Cromwell or Retz=
 might now expire in obscurity. The political enthusiasm of Rienzi had exal=
ted him to a throne; the same enthusiasm, in the next century, conducted hi=
s imitator to the gallows. The birth of Stephen Porcaro was noble, his repu=
tation spotless; his tongue was armed with eloquence, his mind was enlighte=
ned with learning; and he aspired, beyond the aim of vulgar ambition, to fr=
ee his country and immortalise his name. The dominion of priests is most od=
ious to a liberal spirit: every scruple was removed by the recent knowledge=
 of the fable and forgery of Constantine=E2=80=99s donation; Petrarch was n=
ow the oracle of the Italians; and, as often as Porcaro revolved the ode wh=
ich describes the patriot and hero of Rome, he applied to himself the visio=
ns of the prophetic bard. His first trial of the popular feelings was at th=
e funeral of Eugenius the Fourth: in an elaborate speech, he called the Rom=
ans to liberty and arms; and they listened with apparent pleasure, till Por=
caro was interrupted and answered by a grave advocate, who pleaded for the =
church and state. By every law the seditious orator was guilty of treason; =
but the benevolence of the new pontiff, who viewed his character with pity =
and esteem, attempted, by an honourable office, to convert the patriot into=
 a friend. The inflexible Roman returned from Anagni with an increase of re=
putation and zeal; and on the first opportunity, the games of the place Nav=
ona, he tried to inflame the casual dispute of some boys and mechanics into=
 a general rising of the people. Yet the humane Nicholas was still averse t=
o accept the forfeit of his life; and the traitor was removed from the scen=
e of temptation to Bologna, with a liberal <span class=3D"pb"><span class=
=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</s=
pan>173<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> allowance for his support, a=
nd the easy obligation of presenting himself each day before the governor o=
f the city. But Porcaro had learned from the younger Brutus that with tyran=
ts no faith or gratitude should be observed: the exile declaimed against th=
e arbitrary sentence; a party and a conspiracy were gradually formed; his n=
ephew, a daring youth, assembled a band of volunteers; and on the appointed=
 evening a feast was prepared at his house for the friends of the republic.=
 Their leader, who had escaped from Bologna, appeared among them in a robe =
of purple and gold: his voice, his countenance, his gestures, bespoke the m=
an who had devoted his life or death to the glorious cause. In a studied or=
ation, he expatiated on the motives and the means of their enterprise; the =
name and liberties of Rome; the sloth and pride of their ecclesiastical tyr=
ants; the active or passive consent of their fellow-citizens; three hundred=
 soldiers and four hundred exiles, long exercised in arms or in wrongs; the=
 licence of revenge to edge their swords, and a million of ducats to reward=
 their victory. It would be easy (he said) on the next day, the festival of=
 the Epiphany, to seize the pope and his cardinals before the doors, or at =
the altar, of St. Peter=E2=80=99s; to lead them in chains under the walls o=
f St. Angelo; to extort by the threat of their instant death a surrender of=
 the castle; to ascend the vacant Capitol; to ring the alarm-bell; and to r=
estore in a popular assembly the ancient republic of Rome. While he triumph=
ed, he was already betrayed. The senator, with a strong guard, invested the=
 house; the nephew of Porcaro cut his way through the crowd; but the unfort=
unate Stephen was drawn from a chest, lamenting that his enemies had antici=
pated by three hours the execution of his design. After such manifest and r=
epeated guilt, even the mercy of Nicholas was silent. Porcaro, and nine of =
his accomplices, were hanged without the benefit of the sacraments; and, am=
idst the fears and invectives of the papal court, the Romans pitied, and al=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-12_256">But the independence of the nobles, which was =
fomented by discord, survived the freedom of the commons, which must be fou=
nded in union. A privilege of rapine and oppression was long maintained by =
the barons of Rome; their houses were a fortress and a sanctuary; and the f=
erocious train of banditti and criminals whom they protected from the law r=
epaid the hospitality with the service of their swords and daggers. The pri=
vate interest of the pontiffs, or their nephews, sometimes involved them in=
 these domestic feuds. Under the reign of Sixtus the Fourth, Rome was distr=
acted by the battles and sieges of the rival houses; after the conflagratio=
n of his palace, the proto-notary Colonna was tortured and beheaded; and Sa=
velli, his captive friend, was murdered on the spot, for refusing to join i=

duce a short inquiry into the general causes and effects. 1. Two hundred ye=

a description of Rome.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the=

their fall.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-12_263">After a diligent inquiry, I can discern four p=

 hostile attacks of the Barbarians and Christians. III. The use and abuse o=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-12_264">I. The art of man is able to construct monumen=

 is more accessible to injury and decay; and the silent lapse of time is of=

r can the damage be restored either by the public care of government or the=
 activity of private interest. Yet two causes may be alleged, which render =
the calamity of fire more destructive to a flourishing than a decayed city.=
 I. The more combustible materials of brick, timber, and metals are first m=

naked walls and massy arches that have been despoiled of their ornaments. 2=

 the greater edifices which have resisted or escaped are left as so many is=
lands in a state of solitude and safety. From her situation, Rome is expose=
d to the danger of frequent inundations. Without excepting the Tiber, the r=

all former measure of time and place, destroyed all the buildings that were=
 situate below the hills of Rome. According to the variety of ground, the s=

Empire: the greatest, perhaps, and most awful scene in the history of manki=
nd. The various causes and progressive effects are connected with many of t=
he events most interesting in human annals: the artful policy of the C=C3=
=A6sars, who long maintained the name and image of a free republic; the dis=
order of military despotism; the rise, establishment, and sects of Christia=
nity; the foundation of Constantinople; the division of the monarchy; the i=
nvasion and settlements of the Barbarians of Germany and Scythia; the insti=
tutions of the civil law; the character and religion of Mahomet; the tempor=
al sovereignty of the popes; the restoration and decay of the Western empir=
e of Charlemagne; the crusades of the Latins in the East; the conquests of =
the Saracens and Turks; the ruin of the Greek empire; the state and revolut=
ions of Rome in the middle age. The historian may applaud the importance an=
d variety of his subject; but, while he is conscious of his own imperfectio=
ns, he must often accuse the deficiency of his materials. It was among the =
ruins of the Capitol that I first conceived the idea of a work which has am=
used and exercised near twenty years of my life, and which, however inadequ=
ate to my own wishes, I finally deliver to the curiosity and candour of the=
 public.</p>

enough to our knowledge of facts. The description of the siege does not beg=
in till the middle of the Third book. In the First book there is an account=
 of the battle of Varna, and much about the ecclesiastical antagonism of th=
e Greeks and Latins. The Second begins with the death of John Palacologus a=
nd the accession of Constantine, and contains a virulent description of the=
 moral degeneration of the people of Constantinople (v. 117 <i>sqq.</i>): =

itobulus (i. 60 <i>ad fin.</i>). North of the Porta Charseae, south of the =

lled the Kerkoporta by Ducas (wrongly?), and was always kept shut, but had =
been opened by Giustiniani=E2=80=99s orders for the purpose of a possible s=

 and fifty Turks followed them, as they neglected to shut the gate. More Tu=

 to the gate, and set up the Ottoman standards on the walls. The retreat of=
 the Greeks, who were outside the inner wall, by the Kerkoporta was now cut=
 off, and seeing the flags of the foe on the battlements they thronged back=
 through the Porta Charseae, which was then left undefended, so that the Tu=

istributes his own observations into twenty days, he should have styled the=
m weeks, or months, of his visits to the different parts of the city (Diari=
um Italicum, c. 8-20, p. 104-301). That learned Benedictine reviews the top=
ographers of ancient Rome; the first efforts of Blondus, Fulvius, Martianus=
, and Faunus, the superior labours of Pyrrhus Ligorius, had his learning be=
en equal to his labours; the writings of Onuphrius Panvinius, qui omnes obs=
curavit, and the recent but imperfect books of Donatus and Nardini Yet Mont=
faucon still sighs for a more complete plan and description of the old city=
, which must be attained by the three following methods: 1. The measurement=
 of the space and intervals of the ruins. 2. The study of inscriptions and =
the places where they were found. 3. The investigation of all the acts, cha=
rters, diaries of the middle ages, which name any spot or building of Rome.=
 The laborious work, such as Montfaucon desired, must be promoted by prince=
ly or public munificence; but the great modern plan of Nolli (<span class=
=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 1748) would furnish a so=
lid and accurate basis for the ancient topography of Rome. [We have now Lan=
