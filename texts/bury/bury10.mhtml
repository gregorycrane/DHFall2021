<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_268"><span class=3D"csc">In</span> the profession o=
f Christianity, the variety of national characters may be clearly distingui=
shed. The natives of Syria and Egypt abandoned their lives to lazy and cont=
emplative devotion; Rome again aspired to the dominion of the world; and th=
e wit of the lively and loquacious Greeks was consumed in the disputes of m=
etaphysical theology. The incomprehensible mysteries of the Trinity and Inc=
arnation, instead of commanding their silent submission, were agitated in v=
ehement and subtle controversies, which enlarged their faith, at the expens=
e, perhaps, of their charity and reason. From the council of Nice to the en=
d of the seventh century, the peace and unity of the church was invaded by =
these spiritual wars; and so deeply did they affect the decline and fall of=
 the empire that the historian has too often been compelled to attend the s=
ynods, to explore the creeds, and to enumerate the sects of this busy perio=
d of ecclesiastical annals. From the beginning of the eighth century to the=
 last ages of the Byzantine empire the sound of controversy was seldom hear=
d; curiosity was exhausted, zeal was fatigued, and, in <span class=3D"pb"><=
span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bra=
cket">[</span>2<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> the decrees of six c=
ouncils, the articles of the Catholic faith had been irrevocably defined. T=
he spirit of dispute, however vain and pernicious, requires some energy and=
 exercise of the mental faculties; and the prostrate Greeks were content to=
 fast, to pray, and to believe, in blind obedience to the patriarch and his=
 clergy. During a long dream of superstition, the Virgin and the Saints, th=
eir visions and miracles, their relics and images, were preached by the mon=
ks and worshipped by the people; and the appellation of people might be ext=
ended without injustice to the first ranks of civil society. At an unseason=
able moment the Isaurian emperors attempted somewhat rudely to awaken their=
 subjects: under their influence, reason might obtain some proselytes, a fa=
r greater number was swayed by interest or fear; but the Eastern world embr=
aced or deplored their visible deities, and the restoration of images was c=
elebrated as the feast of orthodoxy. In this passive and unanimous state th=
e ecclesiastical rulers were relieved from the toil, or deprived of the ple=
asure, of persecution. The Pagans had disappeared; the Jews were silent and=
 obscure; the disputes with the Latins were rare and remote hostilities aga=
inst a national enemy; and the sects of Egypt and Syria enjoyed a free tole=
ration, under the shadow of the Arabian caliphs. About the middle of the se=
venth century, a branch of Manich=C3=A6ans was selected as the victims of s=
piritual tyranny: their patience was at length exasperated to despair and r=
ebellion; and their exile has scattered over the West the seeds of reformat=
ion. These important events will justify some inquiry into the doctrine and=
 story of the <span class=3D"csc">Paulicians:</span><a href=3D"https://oll.=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_270">Of the ecclesiastical chain, many links have b=
een broken by the Paulician reformers; and their liberty was enlarged, as t=
hey reduced the number of masters at whose voice profance reason must bow t=
o mystery and miracle. The early separation of the Gnostics had preceded th=
e establishment of the Catholic worship; and against the gradual innovation=
s of discipline and doctrine they were as strongly guarded by habit and ave=
rsion as by the silence of St. Paul and the evangelists. The objects which =
had been transformed by the magic of superstition appeared to the eyes of t=
he Paulicians in their genuine and naked colours. An image made without han=
ds was the common workmanship of a mortal artist, to whose skill alone the =
wood and canvas must be indebted for their merit or value. The miraculous r=
elics were an heap of bones and ashes, destitute of life or virtue, or of a=
ny relation, perhaps, with the person to whom they were ascribed. The true =
and vivifying cross was a piece of sound or rotten timber; the body and blo=
od of Christ, a loaf of bread and a cup of wine, the gifts of nature and th=
e symbols of grace. The mother of God was degraded from her celestial honou=
rs and immaculate virginity; and the saints and angels were no longer solic=
ited to exercise the laborious office of mediation in heaven and ministry u=
pon earth. In the practice, or at least in the theory, of the sacraments, t=
he Paulicians were inclined to abolish all visible objects of worship, and =
the words of the gospel were, in their judgment, the baptism and communion =
of the faithful. They indulged a convenient latitude for the interpretation=
 of scripture; and, as often as they were pressed by the literal sense, the=
y could escape to the intricate mazes of figure and allegory. Their <span c=

 class=3D"bracket">[</span>7<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> utmost =
diligence must have been employed to dissolve the connection between the Ol=
d and the New Testament; since they adored the latter as the oracles of God=
, and abhorred the former as the fabulous and absurd invention of men or de=
mons. We cannot be surprised that they should have found in the gospel the =
orthodox mystery of the Trinity; but, instead of confessing the human natur=
e and substantial sufferings of Christ, they amused their fancy with a cele=
stial body that passed through the virgin like water through a pipe; with a=
 fantastic crucifixion that eluded the vain and impotent malice of the Jews=
. A creed thus simple and spiritual was not adapted to the genius of the ti=

 and the rational Christian, who might have been contented with the light y=
oke and easy burthen of Jesus and his apostles, was justly offended that th=
e Paulicians should dare to violate the unity of God, the first article of =
natural and revealed religion. Their belief and their trust was in the Fath=
er of Christ, of the human soul, and of the invisible world. But they likew=

riends and enemies in one common description; and the picture may be height=
ened by some strokes from their contemporaries of the tenth century. Except=
 the merit and fame of military prowess, all that is valued by mankind appe=
ared vile and contemptible to these Barbarians, whose native fierceness was=
 stimulated by the consciousness of numbers and freedom. The tents of the H=
ungarians were of leather, their garments of fur; they shaved their hair an=

aty perfidious; and they shared the common reproach of Barbarians, too igno=

span> to conceive the importance of truth, too proud to deny or palliate th=
e breach of their most solemn engagements. Their simplicity has been praise=
d; yet they abstained only from the luxury they had never known; whatever t=
hey saw, they coveted; their desires were insatiate, and their sole industr=
y was the hand of violence and rapine. By the definition of a pastoral nati=
on, I have recalled a long description of the economy, the warfare, and the=
 government that prevail in that stage of society; I may add that to fishin=
g as well as to the chase the Hungarians were indebted for a part of their =
subsistence; and, since they <i>seldom</i> cultivated the ground, they must=
, at least in their new settlements, have sometimes practised a slight and =
unskilful husbandry. In their emigrations, perhaps in their expeditions, th=
e host was accompanied by thousands of sheep and oxen, which increased the =
cloud of formidable dust, and afforded a constant and wholesome supply of m=
ilk and animal food. A plentiful command of forage was the first care of th=
e general, and, if the flocks and herds were secure of their pastures, the =
hardy warrior was alike insensible of danger and fatigue. The confusion of =
men and cattle that overspread the country exposed their camp to a nocturna=
l surprise, had not a still wider circuit been occupied by their light cava=
lry, perpetually in motion to discover and delay the approach of the enemy.=
 After some experience of the Roman tactics, they adopted the use of the sw=
ord and spear, the helmet of the soldier, and the iron breast-plate of his =
steed; but their native and deadly weapon was the Tartar bow; from the earl=
iest infancy, their children and servants were exercised in the double scie=
nce of archery and horsemanship; their arm was strong; their aim was sure; =
and, in the most rapid career, they were taught to throw themselves backwar=
ds, and to shoot a volley of arrows into the air. In open combat, in secret=
 ambush, in flight or pursuit, they were equally formidable; an appearance =
of order was maintained in the foremost ranks, but their charge was driven =
forwards by the impatient pressure of succeeding <span class=3D"pb"><span c=
lass=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">=
[</span>42<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> crowds. They pursued, hea=
dlong and rash, with loosened reins and horrific outcries; but if they fled=
, with real or dissembled fear, the ardour of a pursuing foe was checked an=
d chastised by the same habits of irregular speed and sudden evolution. In =
the abuse of victory, they astonished Europe, yet smarting from the wounds =
of the Saracen and the Dane; mercy they rarely asked, and more rarely besto=
wed; both sexes were accused as equally inaccessible to pity, and their app=
etite for raw flesh might countenance the popular tale that they drank the =
blood and feasted on the hearts of the slain. Yet the Hungarians were not d=
evoid of those principles of justice and humanity which nature has implante=
d in every bosom. The licence of public and private injuries was restrained=
 by laws and punishments; and in the security of an open camp theft is the =
most tempting and most dangerous offence. Among the Barbarians, there were =
many whose spontaneous virtue supplied their laws and corrected their manne=

depends on the existence of danger; and that danger must be estimated by th=
e twofold consideration of the malice <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"dec=
oration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>201=
<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> and the power of our enemies. A per=
nicious tenet has been imputed to the Mahometans, the duty of <i>extirpatin=
g</i> all other religions by the sword. This charge of ignorance and bigotr=
y is refuted by the Koran, by the history of the Musulman conquerors, and b=
y their public and legal toleration of the Christian worship. But it cannot=
 be denied that the Oriental churches are depressed under their iron yoke; =
that, in peace and war, they assert a divine and indefeasible claim of univ=
ersal empire; and that, in their orthodox creed, the unbelieving nations ar=
e continually threatened with the loss of religion or liberty. In the eleve=
nth century, the victorious arms of the Turks presented a real and urgent a=
pprehension of these losses. They had subdued, in less than thirty years, t=
he kingdoms of Asia, as far as Jerusalem and the Hellespont; and the Greek =
empire tottered on the verge of destruction. Besides an honest sympathy for=
 their brethren, the Latins had a right and interest in the support of Cons=
tantinople, the most important barrier of the West; and the privilege of de=
fence must reach to prevent, as well as to repel, an impending assault. But=
 this salutary purpose might have been accomplished by a moderate succour; =
and our calmer reason must disclaim the innumerable hosts and remote operat=
ions which overwhelmed Asia and depopulated Europe. II. Palestine could add=
 nothing to the strength or safety of the Latins; and fanaticism alone coul=
d pretend to justify the conquest of that distant and narrow province. The =
Christians affirmed that their inalienable title to the promised land had b=
een sealed by the blood of their divine Saviour: it was their right and dut=
y to rescue their inheritance from the unjust possessors, who profaned his =
sepulchre and oppressed the pilgrimage of his disciples. Vainly would it be=
 alleged that the pre-eminence of Jerusalem and the sanctity of Palestine h=
ave been abolished with the Mosaic law; that the God of the Christians is n=
ot a local deity; and that the recovery of Bethlehem or Calvary, his cradle=
 or his tomb, will not atone for the violation of the moral precepts of <sp=
an class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><=
span class=3D"bracket">[</span>202<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> t=
he gospel. Such arguments glance aside from the leaden shield of superstiti=
on; and the religious mind will not easily relinquish its hold on the sacre=
d ground of mystery and miracle. III. But the holy wars which have been wag=
ed in every climate of the globe, from Egypt to Livonia, and from Peru to H=
indostan, require the support of some more general and flexible tenet. It h=
as been often supposed, and sometimes affirmed, that a difference of religi=
on is a worthy cause of hostility; that obstinate unbelievers may be slain =
or subdued by the champions of the cross; and that grace is the sole founta=
in of dominion as well as of mercy. Above four hundred years before the fir=
st crusade, the Eastern and Western provinces of the Roman empire had been =
acquired about the same time, and in the same manner, by the Barbarians of =
Germany and Arabia. Time and treaties had legitimated the conquests of the =
<i>Christian</i> Franks: but, in the eyes of their subjects and neighbours,=
 the Mahometan princes were still tyrants and usurpers, who, by the arms of=
 war or rebellion, might be lawfully driven from their unlawful possession.=

of the monks; some sins are enumerated which innocence could not have suspe=

s of fornication and adultery, of perjury and sacrilege, of rapine and murd=
er, were expiated by a penance which, according to the various circumstance=
s, was prolonged from forty days to seven years. During this term of mortif=
ication, the patient was healed, the criminal was absolved, by a salutary r=
egimen of fasts and prayers; the disorder of his dress was expressive of gr=
ief and remorse; and he humbly abstained from all the business and pleasure=
 of social life. But the rigid execution of these laws would have depopulat=
ed the palace, the camp, and the city; the Barbarians of the West believed =
and trembled; but nature often rebelled against principle; and the magistra=
te laboured without effect to enforce the jurisdiction of the priest. A lit=

not the sole, that in <i>some</i> it was not the leading, principle of acti=

rresistible to impel, the stream of national manners. Against the private w=
ars of the Barbarians, their bloody tournaments, licentious loves, and judi=
cial duels, the popes and synods might ineffectually thunder. It is a more =
easy task to provoke the metaphysical disputes of the Greeks, to drive into=
 the cloister the victims of anarchy or despotism, to sanctify the patience=
 of slaves and cowards, or to assume the merit of the humanity and benevole=
nce of modern Christians. War and exercise were the reigning passions of th=
e Franks or Latins; they were enjoined, as a penance, to gratify those pass=

of the East. Their victory, or even their attempt, would immortalise the na=
mes of the intrepid heroes of the cross; and the purest piety could not be =
insensible to the most splendid prospect of military glory. In the petty qu=
arrels of Europe, they shed the blood of their friends and countrymen, for =
the acquisition perhaps of a castle or a village. They could march with ala=
crity against the distant and hostile nations who were devoted to their arm=

e have singly computed their weight on the mind of each individual, we must=
 add the infinite series, the multiplying powers of example and fashion. Th=

it, and the recompense of their holy vow; and the most reluctant hearers we=
re insensibly drawn within the whirlpool of persuasion and authority. The m=
artial youths were fired by the reproach or suspicion of cowardice; the opp=
ortunity of visiting with an army the sepulchre of Christ was embraced by t=
he old and infirm, by women and children, who consulted rather their zeal t=
han their strength; and those who in the evening had derided the folly of t=
heir companions were the most eager, the ensuing day, to tread in their foo=
tsteps. The ignorance, which magnified the hopes, diminished the perils, of=
 the enterprise. Since the Turkish conquest, the paths of pilgrimage were o=
bliterated; the chiefs themselves had an imperfect notion of the length of =
the way and the state of their enemies; and such was the stupidity of the p=
eople that, at the sight of the first city or castle beyond the limits of t=
heir knowledge, they were ready to ask, whether that was not the Jerusalem,=
 the term and object of their labours. Yet the more prudent of the crusader=
s, who were not sure that they should be fed from heaven with a shower of q=
uails or manna, provided themselves with those precious metals which, in ev=
ery country, are the representatives of every commodity. To defray, accordi=
ng to their rank, the expenses of the road, princes alienated their provinc=
es, nobles their lands and castles, peasants their cattle and the instrumen=
ts of husbandry. The value of property was depreciated by the eager competi=
tion of multitudes; while the price of arms and horses was raised to an exo=

ich it was lawful for him to endure. But superstition mingled in every publ=
ic and private action of life; in the holy wars, it sanctified the professi=
on of arms; and the order of chivalry was assimilated in its rights and pri=
vileges to the sacred orders of priesthood. The bath and white garment of t=
he novice were an indecent copy of the regeneration of baptism; his sword, =
which he offered on the altar, was blessed by the ministers of religion; hi=
s solemn reception was preceded by fasts and vigils; and he was created a k=
night, in the name of God, of St. George, and of St. Michael the archangel.=
 He swore to accomplish the duties of his profession; and education, exampl=

 champion of God and the ladies (I blush to unite such discordant names), h=
e devoted himself to speak the truth; to maintain the right; to protect the=
 distressed; to practise <i>courtesy,</i> a virtue less familiar to the anc=
ients; to pursue the infidels; to despise the allurements of ease and safet=
y; and to vindicate in every perilous adventure the honour of his character=
. The abuse of the same spirit provoked the illiterate knight to disdain th=
e arts of industry and peace; to esteem himself the sole judge and avenger =
of his own injuries; and proudly to neglect the laws of civil society and m=
ilitary discipline. Yet the benefits of this institution, to refine the tem=
per of Barbarians, and to infuse some principles of faith, justice, and hum=

 The skill and strength that were exerted in wrestling and boxing bear a di=
stant and doubtful relation to the merit of a soldier; but the tournaments,=
 as they were invented in France and eagerly adopted both in the East and W=
est, presented a lively image of the business of the field. The single comb=
ats, the general skirmish, the defence of a pass or castle, were rehearsed =
as in actual service; and the contest, both in real and mimic war, was deci=
ded by the superior management of the horse and lance. The lance was the pr=
oper and peculiar weapon of the knight; his horse was of a large and heavy =
breed; but this charger, till he was roused by the approaching danger, was =
usually led by an attendant, and he quietly rode a pad or palfrey of a more=
 easy pace. His helmet and sword, his greaves and buckler, it would be supe=
rfluous to describe; but I may remark that at the period of the crusades th=
e armour was less ponderous than in later times; and that, instead of a mas=
sy cuirass, his breast was defended by an hauberk or coat of mail. When the=
ir long lances were fixed in the rest, the warriors furiously spurred their=
 horses against the foe; and the light cavalry of the Turks and Arabs could=
 seldom stand against the direct and impetuous weight of their charge. Each=

and four, or five, or six soldiers were computed as the furniture of a comp=

oly Land, the duties of the feudal tenure no longer subsisted; the voluntar=
y service of the knights and their followers was either prompted by zeal or=
 attachment, or purchased with rewards and promises; and the numbers of eac=

rom the banks of the Meuse and the Moselle, Godfrey of Bouillon followed th=
e direct way of Germany, Hungary, and Bulgaria; and, as long as he exercise=
d the sole command, every step afforded some proof of his prudence and virt=
ue. On the confines of Hungary he was stopped three weeks by a Christian pe=
ople, to whom the name, or at least the abuse, of the cross was justly odio=
us. The Hungarians still smarted with the wounds which they had received fr=
om the first pilgrims; in their turn they had abused the right of defence a=

ero of the same nation, and who was engaged in the same cause. But, after w=
eighing the motives and the events, the virtuous duke was content to pity t=
he crimes and misfortunes of his worthless brethren; and his twelve deputie=
s, the messengers of peace, requested in his name a free passage and an equ=
al market. To remove their suspicions, Godfrey trusted himself, and afterwa=
rds his brother, to the faith of Carloman, king of Hungary, who treated the=
m with a simple but hospitable entertainment: the treaty was sanctified by =
their common gospel; and a proclamation, under pain of death, restrained th=

 and the proximity of Carloman, who hovered on their flanks with his numero=

own. They reached the banks of the Save; and no sooner had they passed the =
river than the king of Hungary restored the hostages and saluted their depa=
rture with the fairest wishes for the success of their enterprise. With the=
 same conduct and discipline, Godfrey pervaded the woods of Bulgaria and th=

atrimony of the Roman emperor; and his ancient and perpetual claim still em=
braced the kingdoms of Syria and Egypt. In his enthusiasm, Alexius indulged=
, or affected, the ambitious hope of leading his new allies to subvert the =
thrones of the East; but the calmer dictates of reason and temper dissuaded=
 him from exposing his royal person to the faith of unknown and lawless Bar=
barians. His prudence, or his pride, was content with extorting from the Fr=
ench princes an oath of homage and fidelity, and a solemn promise that they=
 would either restore, or hold, their Asiatic conquests as the humble and l=
oyal vassals of the Roman empire. Their independent spirit was fired at the=
 mention of this foreign and voluntary servitude; they successively yielded=
 to the dextrous application of gifts and flattery; and the first proselyte=

 every human consideration was subordinate to the glory of God and the succ=

despised; and sermons and edicts were alike fruitless against those scandal=

.=E2=80=9D The pope=E2=80=99s legate, the bishop of Puy, affected to listen=
 with coldness and distrust; but the revelation was eagerly accepted by Cou=

the third day, after a due preparation of prayer and fasting, the priest of=
 Marseilles introduced twelve trusty spectators, among whom were the count =
and his chaplain; and the church doors were barred against the impetuous mu=
ltitude. The ground was opened in the appointed place; but the workmen, who=
 relieved each other, dug to the depth of twelve feet without discovering t=
he object of their search. In the evening, when Count Raymond had withdrawn=
 to his post, and the weary assistants began to murmur, Bartholemy, in his =
shirt and without his shoes, boldly descended into the pit; the darkness of=
 the hour and of the place enabled him to secrete and deposit the head of a=
 Saracen lance, and the first sound, the first gleam, of the steel was salu=

in a veil of silk and gold, and exposed to the veneration of the crusaders;=
 their anxious suspense burst forth in a general shout of joy and hope, and=
 the desponding troops were again inflamed with the enthusiasm of valour. W=
hatever had been the arts, and whatever might be the sentiments of the chie=

ice; the tumult of battle allowed no time for doubt or scrutiny; and the we=
lcome apparition dazzled the eyes or the imagination of a fanatic army. In =
the season of danger and triumph, the revelation of Bartholemy of Marseille=
s was unanimously asserted; but, as soon as the temporary service was accom=
plished, the personal dignity and liberal alms which the count of Toulouse =
derived from the custody of the holy lance provoked the envy, and awakened =
the reason, of his rivals. A Norman clerk presumed to sift, with a philosop=
hic spirit, the truth of the legend, the circumstances of the discovery, an=
d the character of the prophet; and the pious Bohemond ascribed their deliv=
erance to the merits and intercession of Christ alone. For a while the prov=

God. A pile of faggots, four feet high and fourteen feet long, was erected =
in the midst of the camp; the flames burnt fiercely to the elevation of thi=
rty cubits; and a narrow path of twelve inches was left for the perilous tr=
ial. The unfortunate priest of Marseilles traversed the fire with dexterity=
 and speed: but his thighs and belly were scorched by the intense heat; he =
expired the next day, and the logic of believing minds will pay some regard=
 to his dying protestations of innocence and truth. Some efforts were made =
by the provincials to substitute a cross, a ring, or a tabernacle in the pl=
ace of the holy lance, which soon vanished in contempt and oblivion.<a href=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_370">The justice and freedom of the constitution we=
re maintained by two tribunals of unequal dignity, which were instituted by=
 Godfrey of Bouillon after the conquest of Jerusalem. The king, in person, =
presided in the upper court, the court of the barons. Of these the four mos=

all the nobles, who held their lands immediately of the crown, were entitle=
d and bound to attend the king=E2=80=99s court; and each baron exercised a =
similar jurisdiction in the subordinate assemblies of his own feudatories. =
The connection of lord and vassal was honourable and voluntary: reverence w=
as due to the benefactor, protection to the dependant; but they mutually pl=
edged their faith to each other, and the obligation on either side might be=
 suspended by neglect or dissolved by injury. The cognisance of marriages a=
nd testaments was blended with religion and usurped by the clergy; but the =
civil and criminal causes of the nobles, the inheritance and tenure of thei=
r fiefs, formed the proper occupation of the supreme court. Each member was=
 the judge and guardian both of public and private rights. It was his duty =
to assert with his tongue and sword the lawful claims of the lord; but, if =
an unjust superior presumed to violate the freedom or property of a vassal,=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_371">The trial by battle was established in all cri=
minal cases which affected the life or limb or honour of any person; and in=
 all civil transactions of or above the value of one mark of silver. It app=
ears that in criminal cases the combat was the privilege of the accuser, wh=
o, except in a charge of treason, avenged his personal injury or the death =
of those persons whom he had a right to represent; but, wherever, from the =
nature of the charge, testimony could be obtained, it was necessary for him=
 to produce witnesses of the fact. In civil cases, the combat was not allow=

the witness with an attempt by perjury to take away his right. He came, the=
refore, to be in the same situation as the appellant in criminal cases. It =

ery case the right to offer battle was founded on the right to pursue by ar=
ms the redress of an injury; and the judicial combat was fought on the same=
 principle, and with the same spirit, as a private duel. Champions were onl=
y allowed to women, and to men maimed or past the age of sixty. The consequ=
ence of a defeat was death to the person accused, or to the champion or wit=
ness, as well as to the accuser himself; but in civil cases the demandant w=
as punished with infamy and the loss of his suit, while his witness and cha=
mpion suffered an ignominious death. In many cases, it was in the option of=
 the judge to award or to refuse the combat; but two are specified in which=
 it was the inevitable result of the challenge: if a faithful vassal gave t=
he lie to his compeer, who unjustly claimed any portion of their lord=E2=80=
=99s demesnes; or if an unsuccessful suitor presumed to impeach the judgmen=
t and veracity of the court. He might impeach them, but the terms were seve=
re and perilous: in the same day he successively fought <i>all</i> the memb=
ers of the tribunal, even those who had been absent; a single defeat was fo=
llowed by death and infamy; and, where none could hope for victory, it is h=
ighly probable that none would adventure the trial. In the Assise of Jerusa=

elude, than to facilitate, the judicial combat, which he derives from a pri=

dina. Saladin condescended to complain; rejoiced in the denial of justice; =
and, at the head of fourscore thousand horse and foot, invaded the Holy Lan=

 Tripoli, to whom it belonged; and the king of Jerusalem was persuaded to d=

the mercy of the conqueror, and to their first suppliant deputation that me=

long-suffering of the Moslems; the hour of forgiveness was elapsed, and the=
 moment was now arrived to expiate in blood, the innocent blood which had b=
een spilt by Godfrey and the first crusaders.=E2=80=9D But a desperate and =
successful struggle of the Franks admonished the sultan that his triumph wa=
s not yet secure; he listened with reverence to a solemn adjuration in the =
name of the common Father of mankind; and a sentiment of human sympathy mol=
lified the rigour of fanaticism and conquest. He consented to accept the ci=
ty, and to spare the inhabitants. The Greek and Oriental Christians were pe=
rmitted to live under his dominion; but it was stipulated, that in forty da=
ys all the Franks and Latins should evacuate Jerusalem, and be safely condu=
cted to the sea-ports of Syria and Egypt; that ten pieces of gold should be=
 paid for each man, five for each woman, and one for every child; and that =
those who were unable to purchase their freedom should be detained in perpe=
tual slavery. Of some writers it is a favourite and invidious theme to comp=
are the humanity of Saladin with the massacre of the first crusade. The dif=
ference would be merely personal; but we should not forget that the Christi=
ans had offered to capitulate, and that the Mahometans of Jerusalem sustain=
ed the last extremities of an assault and storm. Justice is indeed due to t=
he fidelity with which the Turkish conqueror fulfilled the conditions of th=
e treaty; and he may be deservedly praised for the glance of pity which he =
cast on the misery of the vanquished. Instead of a rigorous exaction of his=
 debt, he accepted a sum of thirty thousand byzants, for the ransom of seve=
n thousand poor; two or three thousand more were dismissed by his gratuitou=
s clemency; and the number of slaves was reduced to eleven or fourteen thou=
sand persons. In his interview with the queen, his words, and even his tear=
s, suggested the kindest consolations; his liberal alms were distributed am=
ong those who had been made orphans or widows by the fortune of war; and, w=
hile the knights of the hospital were in arms against him, he allowed their=
 more pious brethren to continue, <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decorat=

 service of the sick. In these acts of mercy, the virtue of Saladin deserve=
s our admiration and love: he was above the necessity of dissimulation; and=
 his stern fanaticism would have prompted him to dissemble, rather than to =
affect, this profane compassion for the enemies of the Koran. After Jerusal=
em had been delivered from the presence of the strangers, the sultan made h=
is triumphant entry, his banners waving in the wind, and to the harmony of =
martial music. The great mosch of Omar, which had been converted into a chu=
rch, was again consecrated to one God and his prophet Mahomet; the walls an=
d pavement were purified with rose-water; and a pulpit, the labour of Noure=
ddin, was erected in the sanctuary. But, when the golden cross that glitter=
ed on the dome was cast down, and dragged through the streets, the Christia=
ns of every sect uttered a lamentable groan, which was answered by the joyf=
ul shouts of the Moslems. In four ivory chests the patriarch had collected =
the crosses, the images, the vases, and the relics of the holy place: they =
were seized by the conqueror, who was desirous of presenting the caliph wit=
h the trophies of Christian idolatry. He was persuaded, however, to entrust=
 them to the patriarch and prince of Antioch; and the pious pledge was rede=

we are no longer describing an irruption of the Northern savages; and, howe=

scope was allowed to their avarice, which was glutted, even in the holy wee=

y promise or treaty, had confiscated the public and private wealth of the G=
reeks; and every hand, according to its size and strength, might lawfully e=
xecute the sentence, and seize the forfeiture. A portable and universal sta=
ndard of exchange was found in the coined and uncoined metals of gold and s=
ilver, which each captor at home or abroad might convert into the possessio=

and luxury had accumulated, the silks, velvets, furs, the gems, spices, and=
 rich moveables, were the most precious, as they could not be procured for =
money in the ruder countries of Europe. An order of rapine was instituted; =
nor was the share of each individual abandoned to industry or chance. Under=
 the tremendous penalties of perjury, excommunication, and death, the Latin=
s were bound to deliver their plunder into the common stock: three churches=
 were selected for the deposit and distribution of the spoil; a single shar=
e was allowed to a foot soldier; two for a serjeant on horseback; four to a=
 knight; and larger proportions according to the rank and merit of the baro=
ns and princes. For violating this sacred engagement, a knight, belonging t=
o the count of St. Paul, was hanged, with his shield and coat of arms round=
 his neck: his example <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Editio=

the Greeks for ever wept over the ruins of their country; and their real ca=

 the conquerors from the three fires which annihilated so vast a portion of=
 the buildings and riches of the city? What a stock of such things as could=
 neither be used or transported was maliciously or wantonly destroyed! How =
much treasure was idly wasted in gaming, debauchery, and riot! And what pre=

 of the soldiers, whose reward was stolen by the base industry of the last =
of the Greeks! These alone who had nothing to lose might derive some profit=
 from the revolution; but the misery of the upper ranks of society is stron=

ce had been reduced to ashes in the second conflagration; and the senator, =
with his family and friends, found an obscure shelter in another house whic=

habitation that his friend, the Venetian merchant, guarded, in the disguise=
 of a soldier, till Nicetas could save, by a precipitate flight, the relics=
 of his fortune and the chastity of his daughter. In a cold wintry season t=
hese fugitives, nursed in the lap of prosperity, departed on foot; his wife=
 was with child; the desertion of their slaves compelled them to carry thei=
r baggage on their own shoulders; and their women, whom they placed in the =
centre, were exhorted to conceal their beauty with dirt, instead of adornin=
g it with paint and jewels. Every step was exposed to insult and danger; th=
e threats of the strangers were less painful than the taunts of the plebe=

safety till their mournful pilgrimage was concluded at Selymbria, above for=

he Erscheinungen in Armenien.=E2=80=9D This investigation, although it is i=
ll arranged and leads to no satisfactory conclusion, has yet been of great =
use in opening up the whole question, as well as by publishing out-of-the-w=
ay evidence on various obscure Armenian sects. While Gieseler held that the=
 treatise of the =E2=80=9CAbbot Peter=E2=80=9D was simply an extract from t=
he work of Peter Sikeliotes, Ter-Mkrttschian tries to prove that the Abbot =
Peter is the oldest of our existing sources =E2=80=94 the source of George =
Monachus, and Photius (Bk. 1 (<i>a</i>)). [The Armenian scholar further pro=
pounded (p. 122 <i>sqq.</i>) the impossible theory that Peter Sikeliotes wr=
ote in the time of Alexius Comnenus =E2=80=94 when the Paulician and Bogomi=
l question was engaging the attention of the court and the public. It is im=
possible, because the date of the Vatican MS. of the treatise of Peter is e=
arlier. As to the Pseudo-Photian account, Ter-Mkrttschian holds that its au=
thor utilised the work of Euthymius Zigabenus (p. 8-9).]</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_424">After Ter-Mkrttschian came J. Friedrich (Der u=
rspr=C3=BCngliche bei Georgios Monachos nur theilweise erhaltene Bericht =
=C3=BCber die Paulikianer, published in the Sitzungsberichte of the Bavaria=
n Academy, 1896, p. 67 <i>sqq.</i>). Friedrich denied that the Abbot Peter=
=E2=80=99s tract was the source used by George Monachus; and he published (=
p. 70-81), as the original source of all the extant accounts, the passage o=
f George Monachus as it appears in the Madrid MS. of the chronicle. In this=
 MS. the passage is more than twice as long as in other MSS., the additiona=
l matter consisting chiefly of directions to Christians how they were to re=
fute a Paulician heretic when they met one. According to Friedrich, the wor=
k of the Abbot Peter is an extract from this treatise, preserved in the Mad=
rid MS.; and the accounts in the other MSS. of George Monachus are likewise=
 extracts.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_425">But the view of Friedrich has been upset concl=
usively by C. de Boor, the only scholar who is thoroughly master of the fac=
ts about the MSS. of George Monachus. In a short paper in the Byzantinische=
 Zeitschrift, vii. p. 40 <i>sqq.</i> (1898), de Boor has shown that the add=
itional matter in the Madrid MS. comes from an interpolator. George seems t=
o have made a second version of his chronicle, and in revising it he consul=
ted his sources, or some of them, again. This seems to be the only hypothes=
is on which the peculiarities of one MS., Coislin. 305, can be explained. I=
n the case of the Paulician passage, de Boor points out that in the first f=
orm of his work (represented by Coislin. 305) he used an original source; f=
rom which he again drew at more length on a second revision (represented by=
 the other MSS.). It is therefore the second revision which we must compare=
 with the work of the Abbot Peter in order to determine whether the Abbot P=
eter is the original source. De Boor does not decide this; but calls attent=
ion to two passages which might seem to show that the Abbot used the second=
 revision of George the Monk, and one passage which rather points to the in=
dependence of the Abbot. On the whole, the second alternative seems more pr=
obable.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_426">The present state of the question may be summe=
d up as follows: The (1) original sketch of the Paulician heresy, its origi=
n and history =E2=80=94 whereon all our extant accounts ultimately depend =
=E2=80=94 is lost. This original work was used by (2) George the Monk (in t=
he 9th century) for his chronicle; (<i>a</i>) in Coislin. 305 we have a sho=
rter extract, (<i>b</i>) in the other MSS. (and Muralt=E2=80=99s text) we h=
ave a fuller extract. (3) The tract of the Abbot Peter was either taken fro=
m the second edition of George the Monk, or was independently extracted fro=
m the original work; but it was not the original work itself. (4) It is not=
 quite certain whether the treatise of Photius was derived from the derivat=
ive work of the Abbot Peter (so Ter-Mkrttschian; and this is also the opini=
on of Ehrhard, <i>ap.</i> Krumbacher=E2=80=99s Byz. Litt. p. 76; but <span =
class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><spa=
n class=3D"bracket">[</span>389<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> Frie=
drich argues against this view, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 85-6); perhaps it is mor=
e likely that Photius also used the original work. (5) The position of Pete=
r Sikeliotes is quite uncertain (see below). (6) The interpolation in the M=
adrid MS. of George the Monk (see above) was added not later than the 10th =
century, in which period the MS. was written. Then come (7) Euthymius Zigab=
enus in the Panoplia, c. 1100 <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">=
ad</span>,</span> and (8) Pseudo-Photius.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_427">The unsolved problem touching Peter Sikeliotes=
 would have no historical importance, except for his statements about his o=
wn mission to Tephrice, and the intention of the Paulicians of the east to =
send missionaries to Bulgaria, and the dedication of his work to an Archbis=
hop of Bulgaria. He says that he himself was sent to Tephrice by Michael II=
I. for the ransom of captives. But the title of the treatise is curious: =

=80=CE=BF=CE=B9=CE=B7=CE=B8=CE=B5=CE=B9=CC=91=CF=83=CE=B1 suggests that the=
 historical setting of the treatise is fictitious. In denying the historica=
l value of this evidence as to the propagation of Paulicianism in Bulgaria =
at such an early date, Ter-Mkrttschian (p. 13 <i>sqq.</i>) and Friedrich (p=
. 101-2) are agreed. According to the life of St. Clement of Bulgaria (ed. =
Miklorich, p. 34) the heresy did not enter the country till after Cement=E2=
=80=99s death in <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></sp=
an> 916 (Friedrich, <i>ib.</i>).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_428">Ter-Mkrttschian endeavours to prove that the P=
aulicians were simply Marcionites. Friedrich argues against this view, on t=
he ground of some statements in the text which he published from the Madrid=
 MS., where the creator of the visible world is identified with the devil. =
But these statements may have been interpolated in the tenth century from a=
 Bogomil source.</p>

estament, and laid weight on a number of old apocryphal works. (2) They hel=
d two principles, equal in age and power: one good (a triune being =3D God)=
; the other bad (=3D Satan); who created the visible world, caused the Fall=
, governed the world during the period of the Old Testament. (3) The body o=
f Christ the Redeemer was only an apparent, not a real body (for everything=
 corporeal is the work of Satan); Mary was an angel. The sacraments are cor=
poreal, and therefore Satanic, symbols. (4) They rejected the use of crucif=
ixes and icons, and regarded churches as the abodes of evil spirits. (5) On=
ly adults were received into their church; the ceremony consisted of fastin=
g and prayer =E2=80=94 not baptism, for water is created by Satan. (6) They=
 had no hierarchy; but an executive, consisting of a senior or bishop, and =
two grades of Apostles. (7) Besides the ordinary Christians there was a spe=
cial order of the Perfect or the Good, who renounced all earthly possession=
s, marriage, and the use of animal food. These chosen few dressed in black,=
 lived like hermits, and were not allowed to speak to an unbeliever except =
for the purpose of converting him. (8) No Bogomil was allowed to drink wine=

rayed whenever they crossed a bridge or entered a village. They had no holy=
 days. (10) They had a death-bed ceremony (called in the west <i>la convene=
nsa</i>). Whoever died without the advantage of this ceremony went to hell,=
 the ultimate a bode of all unbelievers. They did not believe in a purgator=
y.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_431">We cannot, however, feel certain that this is =
a fair presentation of the Bogomil doctrines. It is unfortunate that none o=
f their books of ritual, &amp;c., are known to exist.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_432">As early as the tenth century a schism arose i=
n the Bogomil church. A view was promulgated that Satan was not coeval with=
 God, but only a later creation, a fallen angel. This view prevailed in the=
 Bulgarian church, but the Dragovi=C4=8Di clung to the old dualism. The mod=
ified doctrine was adopted for the most part by the Bogomils of the west (A=
lbigenses, &amp;c.) except at Toulouse and Albano on Lake Garda (Jire=C4=8D=
ek, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 213).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_433">The kinship of the Bogomil doctrines to the Pa=
ulician is obvious. But it has not been proved that they are historically d=
erived from the Paulician; though there are historical reasons for supposin=
g Paulician influence.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_434">Since the above was written, Mr. Conybeare pub=
lished (1898) the Armenian text and an English translation of the book of t=
he Paulicians of Thonrak in Armenia. This book is entitled the Key of Truth=
 and seems to have been drawn up by the beginning of the ninth century. Thi=
s liturgy considerably modifies our views touching the nature of Pauliciani=
sm, which appears to have had nothing to do with Marcionism, but to have be=
en a revival of the old doctrine of Adoptionism according to which Jesus wa=
s a man and nothing more until in his thirtieth year he was baptised by Joh=
n and the Spirit of God came down and entered into him; then and thereby he=
 became the Son of God. Of this Adoptionist view we have two ancient monume=
nts, the <i>Shepherd of Hermas</i> and the <i>Acts of Archelaus.</i> The do=
ctrine survived in Spain until the 8th and 9th centuries; and this fact sug=
gests the conjecture that it also lingered on in southern France, so that t=
he heresy of the Cathars and Albigenses would not have been a mere imported=
 Bogomilism, but an ancient local survival. Mr. Conybeare thinks that it li=
ved on from early times in the Balkan peninsula =E2=80=9Cwhere it was proba=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_435">There can be no doubt that Mr. Conybeare=E2=80=
=99s discovery brings us nearer to the true nature of Paulicianism. In this=
 book the Paulicians speak for themselves, and free themselves from the cha=
rges of Manichaeism and dualism which have been always brought against them=
. Mr. Conybeare thinks that <i>Paulician,</i> the Armenian form of <i>Pauli=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_436">Bulgaria and Russia are Slavonic countries, Bu=
lgarian and Russian are Slavonic languages; but it is an important historic=
al fact that the true Bulgarians and the true Russians, who created these S=
lavonic states, were not Slavs themselves and did not speak Slavonic tongue=
s. The Russian invader was a Teuton; he belonged, at all events, to the sam=
e Indo-European family as the Slavs whom he conquered. But the Bulgarian in=
vader was a Tartar, of wholly different ethnic affinities from the people w=
hom he subdued. In both cases the conqueror was assimilated, gradually forg=
ot his own tongue, and learned the language of his subjects; in both cases =
he gave the name of his own race to the state which he founded. And both ca=
ses point to the same truth touching the Slavs: their strong power of assim=
ilation, and their lack of the political instinct and force which are neces=
sary for creating and organising a political union. Both Bulgaria and Russi=
a were made by strangers.</p>

We saw also (above, vol. vii. Appendix 7) that they were closely connected =
with the tribes of the Uturgurs and Kotrigurs. (3) The next important event=

is break-up they themselves assisted. In the reign of Heraclius, the Bulgar=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_446">The last three reigns cause a difficulty, when=
 we compare them with the notices of Nicephorus (p. 69 and p. 70, ed. de Bo=
or) and Theophanes (<span class=3D"sc">a.m.</span> 6254 and 6256). There se=
ems to be no room for a reign of 7 years between Kormiso=C5=A1 and Telec; i=
t is indeed considered uncertain whether <i>vinech</i> represents the name =
of a prince or belongs closely to the preceding <i>vichtun.</i> The murder =
of Telec happened, according to Nicephorus and Theophanes, in <span class=
=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 762 (after his defeat by=
 Constantine V. in June of that year); but Theophanes relates the elevation=
 of Telec under the same year. Then, according to the Greek historians, Sab=
inos, son-in-law of Kormiso=C5=A1, is elected prince; he makes peace with C=
onstantine, but is presently deposed and flies to Constantinople, Paganos (=
=3D Baian) being elevated in his place. We then find Umar set up by Sabinos=
, as a rival of Baian apparently, and deposed by the Bulgarians, who set up=
 in his stead Toktu, brother of Baian, in <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D=
"entity ad">ad</span></span> 764 =E2=80=94 Baian being apparently dead; thi=
s is the account of Nicephorus. But Theophanes says nothing of Umar; but br=
ings Baian (Paganos) to Constantinople, where Constantine and Sabinos recei=
ve him. Both the Greek writers agree that Constantine invaded Bulgaria in t=
his year, but Nicephorus implies that it was in the interests of Sabinos an=
d Umar. Now in the Bulgarian list Sabinos and Baian do not appear.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_447">The Greek historians are far more likely to ha=
ve made a mistake in regard to these events than the Bulgarian list. The co=
nfusion probably arises from the simultaneous reigns of rival princes. If V=
inech was the natural successor of Kormiso=C5=A1, his reign, lasting seven =
years from the death of Kormiso=C5=A1, was mainly titular; and the three ye=
ars of Telec were synchronous with part of the seven years of Vinech, and a=
lso with the reign of Baian, an usurper whom the list entirely omits.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_448">It would then turn out that <i>Sabinos</i> of =
the Greek historians corresponds to <i>Vinech</i> of the list. As Sabinos r=
aised up Umar (of his own Ukil family) to take his place as prince in <span=
 class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 764, the seven yea=
rs of Sabinos would come to an end in that year and we should place the dea=
th of Kormiso=C5=A1 in 758. As the years of the Bulgarian list need not all=
 be full years, and as Tervel may have died in 719 (he was still alive in 7=
18-19, see Theophanes, <i>sub ann.</i>), there is no difficulty in this sup=
position. We thus get: =E2=80=94</p>

hould be founded and Constantine should be the first bishop. If Ignatius ha=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_466">The great achievement of Constantine or Cyril =
was the invention of a Slavonic alphabet. His immediate missionary work was=
 in Moravia; but by framing an alphabet and translating the gospels into Sl=

ople. He did what Ulfilas did for the Goths, what Mesrob did for the Armeni=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_471">As to their ethnical position, are the Hungari=

wings in the course of their subsequent wanderings. For the latter theory i=

 time dwelled in Jugria, in the regions of the Irtish, where they were neig=
hbours of the Voguls. They migrated southward and in the beginning of the 9=
th century they had taken up their abode within the empire of the Chazars, =
and they amalgamated with themselves a Chazaric tribe called the Kabars (Co=
nst. Porph. c. 39), who became part of the Hungarian nation. These Kabars, =
according to Constantine, taught the Hungarians the tongue of the Chazars. =
Hence the upholders of the Finnic origin of the Turks can explain the Turki=

 the Dnieper in Lebedia, or had already left Lebedia and found a new home i=
n the land between the Dnieper and Dniester. But it must have been about th=

ungarians out of Lebedia and the Hungarians established themselves in Atelk=
uzu, as they called the land between Dnieper and Danube, where they abode a=
bout half a century. Here they came under Slavonic influence; and it was he=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_474">The same enemies, who had driven the Hungarian=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_487">It is agreed by most competent critics of the =
present century that Godfrey of Bouillon neither drew up the Assises of Jer=
usalem as they have come down to us nor put into writing any code of law wh=
atever. This is the opinion of such special students of the Crusades as Wil=
ken, Sybel, Stubbs, Kugler, and Prutz; and recently it has been very forcib=
ly put by M. Gaston Dodu in his Histoire des Institutions monarchiques dans=
 le royaume Latin de J=C3=A9rusalem <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decor=
ation">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>404<s=
pan class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> 1099-1291 (1894). In the first place,=
 we find no mention of such a code in contemporary sources; the earliest au=
thorities who mention it are Ibelin and Philip of Novara in the 13th centur=
y. Then, supposing such a code had been compiled, it is hard to understand =
why it should have been placed in the Holy Sepulchre and why the presence o=
f nine persons should have been necessary to consult it. For the purpose of=
 a code is that it should be referred to without difficulty. Thirdly, the r=
emark of William of Tyre as to the experience of Baldwin III. in judicial m=
atters makes distinctly against the existence of a code. He says: juris con=
suetudinarii, quo regnum regebatur Orientale, plenam habens experientiam: i=
ta ut in rebus dubiis etiam seniores regni principes eius consulerent exper=
ientiam et consulti pectoris eruditionem mirarentur (xvi. 2, cp. on Amalric=
 i. xix. 2). The expression =E2=80=9Cthe customary law by which the kingdom=
 was governed=E2=80=9D suggests that no code existed.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_488">Fourthly, if the code existed, what became of =
it? Ibelin and Philip of Novara say that it was lost when Jerusalem was tak=
en by Saladin in 1187. But the circumstances of that capture are inconsiste=
nt with the probability of such a loss. There were no military excesses and=
 Saladin allowed the inhabitants a delay of forty days to sell or save thei=
r property before he entered the city (Ernoul, c. 18; cp. Dodu, p. 45). It =
is highly unlikely that the Christians would have failed to rescue a posses=
sion so valuable and portable as their Code. The Patriarch could not have o=
verlooked it when he carried forth the treasures of the churches (as Ibn al=
-Ath=C4=ABr mentions). And, if it were unaccountably forgotten, we should h=
ave to suppose that Saladin caused it to be destroyed afterwards when it wa=
s found. And had he done so, it is highly unlikely that the act would not h=
ave been mentioned by some of the Frank chroniclers.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_489">The conclusion is that the kings of Jerusalem =
in the twelfth century did not give decisions according to a code drawn up =
at the time of the foundation of the kingdom, but themselves helped to buil=
d up a structure of Customary Law, which in the following century was colle=
cted and compiled in the book of the Assises by John Ibelin, <span class=3D=
"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 1255.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_490">This book of Ibelin has not come down to us in=
 its original form. There were two redactions: (1) at Nicosia in Cyprus in =
1368 under the direction of an assembly of Cypriote lords, and (2) in the s=
ame place in 1531, by a commission appointed by the Venetian government. Bo=
th these rehandlings introduced a number of corrections into the <i>Assise =
de la haute cour.</i></p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_491">The <i>Assises de la cour des bourgeois</i> st=
and on a different footing. This work seems to have existed perhaps from th=
e end of the twelfth century. It was not <i>supposed</i> to have been destr=
oyed in 1187; it was not, so far as we know, edited by Ibelin; nor was it r=
evised at Nicosia in 1368. (Cp. Dodu, p. 54, 55.)</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-10_492">The study of the Assises of Jerusalem may now =

 iron, brave, cruel, and unscrupulous; and Basil was determined not merely =
to save Eastern, but to conquer Western, Bulgaria. In the first war (976-98=

r=E2=80=99s baptism and marriage; and both the tradition and the gates are =
still preserved at Novogorod. Yet an observing traveller transports the bra=
zen gates from Magdeburg in Germany (Coxe=E2=80=99s Travels into Russia, &a=
mp;c. vol. i. p. 452), and quotes an inscription, which seems to justify hi=
s opinion. The modern reader must not confound this old Cherson of the Taur=
ic or Crim=C3=A6an peninsula [situated on the southern shore of the bay of =
Sebastopol] with a new city of the same name, which had arisen near the mou=
th of the Borysthenes, and was lately honoured by the memorable interview o=
f the empress of Russia with the emperor of the West. [Till recently, the d=
ate of the marriage and conversion of Vladimir was supposed to be <span cla=
ss=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 988. The authority is =
the Russian chronicle of =E2=80=9CNestor,=E2=80=9D which contains the fulle=
st (partly legendary) account (c. 42). Vladimir captured Cherson, and sent =
an embassy, demanding the hand of the princess Anne, and threatening to att=
ack Constantinople if it were refused. Vasilievski showed (in a paper in th=
e Zhurnal Min., 184 (1876), p. 156) from the notice in Leo Diaconus (p. 175=
, ed. Bonn), and the Baron von Rosen (in his book of extracts from the anna=

sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 989 (c. June); and it follow=
s that the marriage and conversion cannot have been celebrated before the a=
utumn of 989. The fragment which is sometimes called =E2=80=9CNotes of the =
Greek toparch of Gothia,=E2=80=9D which was published by Hase (notes to Leo=
 Diaconus, p. 496 <i>sqq.</i> ed. Bonn), does not belong to this period nor=

happened on the lower Don in the early part of the 10th century. This expla=

 1889 (see Schlumberger, L=E2=80=99=C3=A9pop=C3=A9e Byzantine, p. 767, note=

araphrased by the abbot Guibert, a contemporary historian. The Greek text n=

t incorporates the substance of this letter, Recueil, H. Occ. iv. p. 131 <i=
>sqq.</i> The best edition of the text (preserved only in Latin) is that of=
 the Count de Riant (1877 and again 1879). A controversy has raged over the=
 genuineness of the document. Riant rejects it as spurious (like Wilken, Ra=
umer, and others). But it was accepted as genuine by Sybel, and has been de=
fended more recently by Vasilievski (Zhurn. Min. Nar. Prosv. 164, p. 325 <i=
>sqq.</i> 1872) and Hagenmeyer (Byz. Ztsch. vi. 1 <i>sqq.</i> 1897). It is =
doubtless genuine. The objections brought against it are not weighty; and t=
he critics who condemn it have offered no theory of its origin that is in t=
he least probable. It is perfectly incredible that it was composed as a del=
iberate forgery in the year 1098-9 in the camp of the Crusaders, as Riant t=
ries to establish. Its contents are absolutely inconsistent with this theor=
y. It was probably written long <i>before</i> the First Crusade; and Hagenm=
eyer is probably right in assigning it to 1088, when the Empire was in dang=
er from the Patzinaks, and some months after the personal interview of Alex=
ius with Robert of Flanders at Berr=C5=93a. The letter, of course, has suff=
ered seriously in the process of its translation into Latin.]</p></div>

 second four, who were born in Palestine, the effects of the climate and th=
e infection of Oriental habits were sadly apparent; of these four three wer=
e minors at the time of their accession, and one was a leper. The noble fam=
ilies which were not recruited, as the royal family was, with fresh members=
 from Europe, fell more early into weakness and corruption. . . . The moral=
 degradation of the Franks need not have entailed destruction from enemies =
not less degraded; and their inferiority in numbers would have been more th=
an compensated by the successions of pilgrims. . . . But the shortness and =
precariousness of life was an evil without remedy and in its effects irrepa=
rable. Of these the most noticeable was perhaps one which would have arisen=
 under any system, the difficulty of carrying on a fixed policy whilst the =
administrators were perpetually changing; but scarcely second to this was t=
he influence in successions which was thrown into the hands of women. The E=
uropean women were less exposed than the men to the injurious climate or to=
 the fatigues of military service; and many of them having been born in Pal=
estine were in a measure acclimatised. The feudal rights and burdens of hei=
ress-ship, marriage, and dower were strictly observed; consequently most of=
 the heiresses lived to have two or three husbands and two or three familie=

tual, not merely formal, dependence of Venice on Constantinople up to about=
 the years 836-40 (Das Verh=C3=A4ltniss Venedigs zu Byzanz; Th. i., Venedig=
 als byzantinische Provinz, 1891). About that time the weakness of the East=
ern Empire enabled Venice gradually to work her way to a position of indepe=
ndence. By military expeditions, undertaken on her own account, against the=
 Slavonic pirates of the Adriatic and the Saracens who carried their depred=
ations to Dalmatia and the northern part of the Eastern Riviera, and by ent=
ering into independent compacts with the neighbouring cities of Italy, Veni=
ce changed her condition from that of a province to that of a responsible p=
ower, and, when the Eastern Empire regained strength under Basil, it was im=
practicable to recall her to her former subordinate position, and the Emper=
ors were perforce content with a nominal subjection. The man whose policy a=
chieved this result was the Doge Peter Tradonicus. (Lentz, Der allm=C3=A4hl=
iche Uebergang Venedigs von faktischer zu nomineller Abh=C3=A4ngigkeit von =
Byzanz, in Byz. Zeitsch. iii. p. 64 <i>sqq.,</i> 1894.) The earliest indepe=
ndent treaty made by Venice was the Pactum Lotharii of 840: a treaty not wi=
th the Emperor Lothar, but with a number of Italian cities under the auspic=
es of Lothar (see A. Fanta, Die Vertr=C3=A4ge der Kaiser mit Venedig bis ru=

in work, de Bello Constantinopolitano et Imperatoribus Comnenis per Gallos =

 narrative with Greek and Latin materials, and we are indebted to him for a=
