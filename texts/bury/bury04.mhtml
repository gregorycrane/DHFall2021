es of this fatal mandate. Most of the auxiliaries, who engaged their volunt=
ary service, had stipulated that they should never be obliged to pass the A=
lps. The public faith of Rome and the personal honour of Julian had been pl=
edged for the observance of this condition. Such an act of treachery and op=
pression would destroy the confidence, and excite the resentment, of the in=
dependent warriors of Germany, who considered truth as the noblest of their=
 virtues, and freedom as the most valuable of their possessions. The legion=
aries, who enjoyed the title and privileges of Romans, were enlisted for th=
e general defence of the republic; but those mercenary troops heard with co=
ld indifference the antiquated names of the Republic and of Rome. Attached,=
 either from birth or long habit, to the climate and manners of Gaul, they =
loved and admired Julian; they despised, and perhaps hated, the emperor; th=
ey dreaded the laborious march, the Persian arrows, and the burning deserts=
 of Asia. They claimed as their own the country which they had saved; and e=
xcused their want of spirit by pleading the sacred and more immediate duty =
of protecting their families and friends. The apprehensions of the Gauls we=
re derived from the knowledge of the impending and inevitable danger. As so=

to whom the public calamities would be imputed, must find himself, after a =
vain resistance, either a prisoner in the camp of the Barbarians or a crimi=
nal in the palace of Constantius. If Julian complied with the orders which =
he had received, he subscribed his own destruction, and that of a people wh=
o deserved his affection. But a positive refusal was an act of rebellion an=
d a declaration of war. The inexorable jealousy of the emperor, the perempt=
ory, and perhaps insidious, nature of his commands, left not any room for a=
 fair apology or candid interpretation; and the dependent station of the C=
=C3=A6sar scarcely allowed him to pause or to deliberate. Solitude increase=

and Picts; and Florentius was occupied at Vienna by the assessment of the t=
ribute. The latter, a crafty and corrupt statesman, declining to assume a r=
esponsible part on this dangerous occasion, eluded the pressing and repeate=
d invitations of Julian, who represented to him that in every important mea=
sure, the presence of the prefect was indispensable in the council of the p=
rince. In the meanwhile the C=C3=A6sar was oppressed by the rude and <span =

nable to resist, unwilling to comply, Julian expressed, in the most serious=
 terms, his wish, and even his intention, of resigning the purple, which he=
 could not preserve with honour, but which he could not abdicate with safet=
y.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-04_212">After a painful conflict, Julian was compelled=
 to acknowledge that obedience was the virtue of the most eminent subject, =
and that the sovereign alone was entitled to judge of the public welfare. H=

onstantius; a part of the troops began their march for the Alps; and the de=

infants in their arms, accused the desertion of their husbands, in the mixe=

from tent to tent with more boldness and effect, prepared their minds for t=

C=C3=A6sar to hasten the departure of the troops: but they imprudently reje=

liar attention, Julian addressed himself in a studied oration to the surrou=
nding multitude: he celebrated their exploits with grateful applause: encou=
raged them to accept, with alacrity, the honour of serving under the eyes o=
f a powerful and liberal monarch; and admonished them that the commands of =
Augustus required an instant and cheerful obedience. The soldiers, who were=
 apprehensive of offending their general by an indecent clamour, or of bely=
ing their sentiments by false and venal acclamations, maintained an obstina=
te silence, and, after a short pause, were dismissed to their quarters. The=
 principal officers were entertained by the C=C3=A6sar, who professed, in t=
he warmest language of friendship, his desire and his inability to reward, =
according to their deserts, the brave companions of his victories. They ret=
ired from the feast, full of grief and perplexity; and lamented the hardshi=
p of their fate, which tore them from their beloved general and their nativ=
e country. The only expedient which could prevent their separation was bold=
ly agitated and approved; the popular resentment was insensibly moulded int=

passion, and their passions were inflamed by wine; as, on the eve of their =

wn election, while he justifies, in some measure, the resentment and violen=
ce of the troops which had extorted his reluctant consent. He allows the su=
premacy of his brother Constantius; and engages to send him an annual prese=
nt of Spanish horses, to recruit his army with a select number of Barbarian=
 youths, and to accept from his choice a Pr=C3=A6torian prefect of approved=
 discretion and fidelity. But he reserves for himself the nomination of his=
 other civil and military officers, with the troops, the revenue, and the s=
overeignty of the provinces beyond the Alps. He admonishes the emperor to c=
onsult the dictates of justice; to distrust the arts of those venal flatter=
ers who subsist only by the discord of princes; and to embrace the offer of=
 a fair and honourable treaty, equally advantageous to the republic and to =
the house of Constantine. In this negotiation Julian claimed no more than h=
e already possessed. The delegated authority which he had long exercised ov=
er the provinces of Gaul, Spain, and Britain was still obeyed under a name =
more independent and august. The soldiers and the people rejoiced in a revo=
lution which was not stained even with the blood of the guilty. Florentius =
was a fugitive; Lupicinus a prisoner. The persons who were disaffected to t=
he new government were disarmed and secured; and the vacant offices were di=
stributed, according to the recommendation of merit, by a prince who despis=

ns of Europe. The arts of persuasion, so diligently cultivated by the first=
 C=C3=A6sars, were neglected by the military ignorance, and Asiatic pride, =
of their successors; and, if they condescended to harangue the soldiers, wh=
om they feared, they treated with silent disdain the senators, whom they de=
spised. The assemblies of the senate, which Constantius had avoided, were c=
onsidered by Julian as the place where he could exhibit, with the most prop=
riety, the maxims of a republican and the talents of a rhetorician. He alte=
rnately practised, as in a school of declamation, the several modes of prai=
se, of censure, of exhortation; and his friend Libanius has remarked that t=
he study of Homer taught him to imitate the simple, concise style of Menela=
us, the copiousness of Nestor, whose words descended like the flakes of a w=
inter=E2=80=99s snow, or the pathetic and forcible eloquence of Ulysses. Th=
e functions of a judge, which are sometimes incompatible with those of a pr=
ince, were exercised by Julian, not only as a duty, but as an amusement: an=
d, although he might have trusted the integrity and discernment of his Pr=
=C3=A6torian prefects, he often placed himself by their side on the seat of=
 judgment. The acute penetration of his mind was agreeably occupied in dete=
cting and defeating the chicanery of the advocates, who laboured to disguis=
e the truth of facts and to pervert the sense of the laws. He sometimes for=
got the gravity of his station, asked indiscreet or unseasonable questions,=
 and betrayed, by the loudness of his voice and the agitation of his body, =
the earnest vehemence with which he maintained his opinion <span class=3D"p=

prompted him to encourage, and even to solicit, the reproof of his friends =
and ministers; and, whenever they ventured to oppose the irregular sallies =
of his passions, the spectators could observe the shame, as well as the gra=
titude, of their monarch. The decrees of Julian were almost always founded =
on the principles of justice; and he had the firmness to resist the two mos=
t dangerous temptations which assault the tribunal of a sovereign under the=
 specious forms of compassion and equity. He decided the merits of the caus=
e without weighing the circumstances of the parties; and the poor, whom he =
wished to relieve, were condemned to satisfy the just demands of a noble an=
d wealthy adversary. He carefully distinguished the judge from the legislat=
or;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/gibbon-the-history-of-the-d=

 the lowest rank of society, without a hope of emerging from their obscurit=

s fortune. Whatever had been his choice of life, by the force of intrepid c=
ourage, lively wit, and intense application, he would have obtained, or at =
least he would have deserved, the highest honours of his profession; and Ju=
lian might have raised himself to the rank of minister, or general, of the =

 the portrait of Julian, something seems wanting to the grace and perfectio=
n of the whole figure. His genius was less powerful and sublime than that o=
f C=C3=A6sar; nor did he possess the consummate prudence of Augustus. The v=
irtues of Trajan appear more steady and natural, and the philosophy of Marc=
us is more simple and consistent. Yet Julian sustained adversity with firmn=
ess, and prosperity with moderation. After an interval of one hundred and t=
wenty years from the death of Alexander Severus, the Romans beheld an emper=
or who made no distinction between his duties and his pleasures; who labour=
ed to relieve the distress, and to revive the spirit, of his subjects; and =
who endeavoured always to connect authority with merit, and happiness with =
virtue. Even faction, and religious faction, was constrained to acknowledge=
 the superiority of his genius, in peace as well as in war; and to confess,=
 with a sigh, that the apostate Julian was a lover of his country, and that=

 the mind of Julian was penetrated with sincere, deep, and unalterable enth=
usiasm; though he might sometimes exhibit the vicissitudes of pious fraud a=

learn from his faithful friend, the orator Libanius, that he lived in a per=
petual intercourse with the gods and goddesses; that they descended upon ea=

him of every impending danger, and conducted him, by their infallible wisdo=

 These sleeping or waking visions, the ordinary effects of abstinence and f=
anaticism, would almost degrade the emperor to the level of an Egyptian mon=

 occupations. Julian could break from the dream of superstition to arm hims=

 of female dancers, who were dedicated to the service of the temple, it was=

perty of the soil. The Pagans, who had been flattered with the hopes of fre=

Athanasius from the city: and he was pleased to suppose that this act of ju=
stice would be highly agreeable to his pious subjects. The pressing solicit=

he multitude rendered Julian still more inexorable: he was alarmed by the d=
anger of leaving at the head of a tumultuous city a daring and popular lead=

l fortified, surrounded with a double wall, almost encompassed by a branch =
of the Euphrates, and defended by the valour of a numerous garrison. The ex=
hortations of Hormisdas were repulsed with contempt; and the ears of the Pe=
rsian prince were wounded by a just reproach that, unmindful of his royal b=
irth, he conducted an army of strangers against his king and country. The A=
ssyrians maintained their loyalty by a skilful, as well as vigorous, defenc=
e; till, the lucky stroke of a battering-ram having opened a large breach b=
y shattering one of the angles of the wall, they hastily retired into the f=
ortifications of the interior citadel. The soldiers of Julian rushed impetu=
ously into the town, and, after the full gratification of every military ap=
petite, Perisabor was reduced to ashes; and the engines which assaulted the=
 citadel were planted on the ruins of the smoking houses. The contest was c=
ontinued by an incessant and mutual discharge of missile weapons; and the s=
uperiority which the Romans might derive from the mechanical powers of thei=
r balist=C3=A6 and catapult=C3=A6 was counterbalanced by the advantage of t=
he ground on the side of the besieged. But as soon as an <i>Helepolis</i> h=
ad been constructed, which could engage on equal terms with the loftiest ra=
mparts, the tremendous aspect of a moving turret, that would leave no hope =
of resistance or of mercy, terrified the defenders of the citadel into an h=

tted to retire: the plentiful magazines of corn, of arms, and of splendid f=
urniture were partly distributed among the troops, and partly reserved for =
the public service: the useless stores were destroyed by fire or thrown int=
o the stream of the Euphrates; and the fate of Amida was revenged by the to=
tal ruin of Perisabor.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-04_276">The city, or rather fortress, of Maogamalcha, =
which was defended by sixteen large towers, a deep ditch, and two strong an=
d solid walls of brick and bitumen, appears to have been constructed at the=
 distance of eleven miles, as the safeguard of the capital of Persia. The e=
mperor, apprehensive of leaving such an important fortress in his rear, imm=
ediately formed the siege of Maogamalcha; and the Roman army was distribute=
d, for that purpose, into three divisions. Victor, at the head of the calva=
ry, and of a detachment of heavy-armed foot, was ordered to clear the count=
ry as far as the banks of the Tigris and the suburbs of Ctesiphon. The cond=
uct of the attack was assumed by Julian himself, who seemed to place his wh=
ole dependence in the military engines which he erected against the walls; =
while he secretly contrived a more efficacious method of introducing his tr=
oops into the heart of the city. Under the direction of Nevitta and Dagalai=
phus, the trenches were opened at a considerable distance, and gradually pr=
olonged as far as the edge of the ditch. The ditch was speedily filled with=
 earth; and, by the incessant labour of the troops, a mine was carried unde=
r the foundations of the walls, and sustained, at sufficient intervals, by =
props of timber. Three chosen cohorts, advancing in a single file, silently=
 explored the dark and dangerous passage; till their intrepid leader whispe=
red back the intelligence that he was ready to issue from his confinement i=
nto the streets of the hostile city. Julian checked their ardour that he mi=
ght ensure their success; and immediately diverted the attention of the gar=
rison, by the tumult and clamour of a general assault. <span class=3D"pb"><=

from their walls contemptuously beheld the progress of an impotent attack, =
celebrated, with songs of triumph, the glory of Sapor; and ventured to assu=
re the emperor that he might ascend the starry mansion of Ormusd, before he=
 could hope to take the impregnable city of Maogamalcha. The city was alrea=
dy taken. History has recorded the name of a private soldier, the first who=
 ascended from the mine into a deserted tower. The passage was widened by h=
is companions, who pressed forwards with impatient valour. Fifteen hundred =
enemies were already in the midst of the city. The astonished garrison aban=
doned the walls, and their only hope of safety; the gates were instantly bu=
rst open; and the revenge of the soldier, unless it were suspended by lust =
or avarice, was satiated by an undistinguishing massacre. The governor, who=
 had yielded on a promise of mercy, was burnt alive, a few days afterwards,=
 on a charge of having uttered some disrespectful words against the honour =
of prince Hormisdas. The fortifications were razed to the ground; and not a=
 vestige was left that the city of Maogamalcha had ever existed. The neighb=
ourhood of the capital of Persia was adorned with three stately palaces, la=
boriously enriched with every production that could gratify the luxury and =
pride of an Eastern monarch. The pleasant situation of the gardens along th=
e banks of the Tigris was improved, according to the Persian taste, by the =
symmetry of flowers, fountains, and shady walks: and spacious parks were en=
closed for the reception of the bears, lions, and wild boars, which were ma=
intained at a considerable expense for the pleasure of the royal chase. The=
 park-walls were broke down, the savage game was abandoned to the darts of =
the soldiers, and the palaces of Sapor were reduced to ashes, by the comman=
d of the Roman emperor. Julian, on this occasion, shewed himself ignorant, =
or careless, of the laws of civility, which the prudence and refinement of =
polished ages have established between hostile princes. Yet these wanton ra=
vages need not excite in our breasts any vehement emotions <span class=3D"p=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-04_283">As long as the Romans seemed to advance into t=

These detachments were, however, supported by a much greater force; and the=
 heads of the columns were no sooner pointed towards the Tigris than a clou=
d of dust arose on the plain. The Romans, who now aspired only to the permi=
ssion of a safe and speedy retreat, endeavoured to persuade themselves that=
 this formidable appearance was occasioned by a troop of wild asses, or per=
haps by the approach of some friendly Arabs. They halted, pitched their ten=
ts, fortified their camp, passed the whole night in continual alarms; and d=
iscovered, at the dawn of day, that they were surrounded by an army of Pers=
ians. This army, which might be considered only as the van of the Barbarian=

nued their march, their long array, which was forced to bend, or divide, ac=

 either killed or wounded; and the emperor himself, who, on all occasions o=

ad neglected to secure the future execution of his designs by the timely an=
d judicious nomination of an associate and successor. But the royal race of=
 Constantius Chlorus was reduced to his own person; and, if he entertained =
any serious thoughts of investing with the purple the most worthy among the=
 Romans, he was diverted from his resolution by the difficulty of the choic=
e, the jealousy of power, the fear of ingratitude, and the natural presumpt=
ion of health, of youth, and of prosperity. His unexpected death left the e=
mpire without a master and without an heir, in a state of perplexity and da=
nger, which, in the space of fourscore years, had never been experienced, s=
ince the election of Diocletian. In a government which had almost forgotten=
 the distinction of pure and noble blood, the superiority of birth was of l=
ittle moment; the claims of official rank were accidental and precarious; a=
nd the candidates who might aspire to ascend the vacant throne could be sup=
ported only by the consciousness of personal merit, or by the hopes of popu=
lar favour. But the situation of a famished army, encompassed on all sides =
by an host of Barbarians, shortened the moments of grief and deliberation. =
In this scene of terror and distress, the body <span class=3D"pb"><span cla=

 consequences might be apprehended from the discord of two factions, so opp=

erhaps in their religious principles. The superior virtues of Sallust could=
 alone reconcile their divisions and unite their suffrages; and the venerab=

was more strictly proscribed; but the emperor admitted a formal distinction=
 to protect the ancient methods of divination, which were approved by the s=

human mind the latent and deadly principle of fanaticism. But this truce of=

supported their arguments by invectives; and their invectives were sometime=
s followed by blows. Athanasius still reigned at Alexandria; the thrones of=
 Constantinople and Antioch were occupied by Arian prelates, and every epis=
copal vacancy was the occasion of a popular tumult. The Homoousians were fo=

conscience to the direction of his ecclesiastical guides, and promoted, by =
the influence of his authority, the re-union of the <i>Athanasian heretics<=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-04_312">When the suffrage of the generals and of the a=

his reputation in arms, his military skill and experience, and his rigid at=
tachment to the forms, as well as spirit, of ancient discipline were the pr=
incipal motives of their judicious choice. The eagerness of the troops who =
pressed him to nominate his colleague was justified by the dangerous situat=
ion of public affairs; and Valentinian himself was conscious that the abili=
ties of the most active mind were unequal to the defence of the distant fro=
ntiers of an invaded monarchy. As soon as the death of Julian had relieved =
the Barbarians from the terror of his name, the most sanguine hopes of rapi=

he South. Their inroads were often vexatious, and sometimes formidable; but=
, during the twelve years of the reign of Valentinian, his firmness and vig=

ermany. In the unsuspicious moment of a Christian festival, Rando, a bold a=
nd artful chieftain, who had long meditated his attempt, suddenly passed th=
e Rhine; entered the defenceless town, and retired with a multitude of capt=

 whole body of the nation. Count Sebastian, with the bands of Italy and Ill=
yricum, was ordered to invade their country, most probably on the side of R=
h=C3=A6tia. The emperor in person, accompanied by his son Gratian, passed t=

 the modern duchy of Wirtemberg, and resolutely expected the approach of th=

 was obliged to leave behind him his armour-bearer, and his helmet, magnifi=

petition of public misfortunes, the notary Palladius was sent from the cour=

e rigid impartiality of Palladius was easily disarmed: he was tempted to re=
serve for himself a part of the public treasure which he brought with him f=

his own guilt, he could no longer refuse to attest the innocence and merit =

special commission to discover and prosecute the authors of this impious co=

could procure any certain intelligence that the emperor of the West had fix=

 with a small band of veterans, had landed near Igilgilis, or Gigeri, on th=

 crafty Jugurtha. He attempted to deceive, by an apparent submission, the v=
igilance of the Roman general; to seduce the fidelity of his troops; and to=
 protract the duration of the war, by successively engaging the independent=
 tribes of Africa to espouse his quarrel or to protect his flight. Theodosi=
us imitated the example, and obtained the success, of his predecessor Metel=
lus. When Firmus, in the character of a suppliant, accused his own rashness=
 and humbly solicited the clemency of the emperor, the lieutenant of Valent=
inian received and dismissed him with a friendly embrace; but he diligently=
 required the useful and substantial pledges of a sincere repentance; nor c=
ould he be persuaded, by the assurances of peace, to suspend, for an instan=
t, the operations of an active war. A dark conspiracy was detected by the p=
enetration of Theodosius; and he satisfied, without much reluctance, the pu=
blic indignation, which he had secretly excited. Several of the guilty acco=
mplices of Firmus were abandoned, according to ancient custom, to the tumul=

s mingled with respectful admiration. Amidst the boundless plains of Getuli=
a, and the innumerable valleys of Mount Atlas, it was impossible to prevent=
 the escape of Firmus; and, if the usurper could have tired the patience of=
 his antagonist, he would have secured his person in the depth of some remo=
te solitude, and expected the hopes of a future revolution. He was subdued =
by the perseverance of Theodosius; who had formed an inflexible determinati=
on that the war should end only by the death of the tyrant, and that every =
nation of Africa which presumed to support his cause should be involved in =
his ruin. At the head of a small body of troops, which seldom exceeded thre=

etrayed. The hopes of the Armenians were sometimes raised by the presence o=
f their natural sovereign; and the ministers of Valens were satisfied that =
they preserved the integrity of the public faith, if their vassal was not s=
uffered to assume the diadem and title of King. But they soon repented of t=
heir own rashness. They were confounded by the reproaches and threats of th=
e Persian monarch. They found reason to distrust the cruel and inconstant t=
emper of Para himself, who sacrificed, to the slightest suspicions, the liv=
es of his most faithful servants; and held a secret and disgraceful corresp=
ondence with the assassin of his father and the enemy of his country. Under=
 the specious pretence of consulting with the emperor on the subject of the=
ir common interest, Para was persuaded to descend from the mountains of Arm=
enia, where his party was in arms, and to trust his independence and safety=
 to the discretion of a perfidious court. The king of Armenia, for such he =
appeared in his own eyes and in those of his nation, was received with due =
honours by the governors of the provinces through which he passed; but, whe=
n he arrived at Tarsus in Cilicia, his progress was stopped under various p=
retences; his motions were watched with respectful vigilance; and he gradua=
lly discovered that he was a prisoner in the hands of the Romans. Para supp=
ressed his indignation, dissembled his fears, and, after secretly preparing=
 his escape, mounted on horseback with three hundred of his faithful follow=
ers. The officer stationed at the door of his apartment immediately communi=
cated his flight to the consular of Cilicia, who overtook him in the suburb=
s, and endeavoured, without success, to dissuade him from prosecuting his r=
ash and dangerous design. A legion was ordered to pursue the royal fugitive=
; but the pursuit of infantry could not be very alarming to a body of light=
 cavalry; and upon the first cloud of arrows that was discharged into the a=
ir they retreated with precipitation to the gates of Tarsus. After an inces=
sant march of two days and <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Ed=
ition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>244<span class=
=3D"bracket">]</span></span> two nights, Para and his Armenians reached the=
 banks of the Euphrates; but the passage of the river, which they were obli=
ged to swim, was attended with some delay and some loss. The country was al=
armed; and the two roads, which were only separated by an interval of three=
 miles, had been occupied by a thousand archers on horseback, under the com=
mand of a count and a tribune. Para must have yielded to superior force, if=
 the accidental arrival of a friendly traveller had not revealed the danger=
, and the means of escape. A dark and almost impervious path securely conve=
yed the Armenian troop through the thicket; and Para had left behind him th=
e count and the tribune, while they patiently expected his approach along t=
he public highways. They returned to the Imperial court to excuse their wan=
t of diligence or success: and seriously alleged that the king of Armenia, =
who was a skilful magician, had transformed himself and his followers, and =
passed before their eyes under a borrowed shape. After his return to his na=
tive kingdom, Para still continued to profess himself the friend and ally o=
f the Romans; but the Romans had injured him too deeply ever to forgive, an=
d the secret sentence of his death was signed in the council of Valens. The=
 execution of the bloody deed was committed to the subtle prudence of Count=
 Trajan; and he had the merit of insinuating himself into the confidence of=
 the credulous prince, that he might find an opportunity of stabbing him to=
 the heart. Para was invited to a Roman banquet, which had been prepared wi=

they perceived, by the hostile state of the country, that the civil and mil=

indignantly threw down their arms at the feet of the conqueror, who offered=
 them food and chains; the numerous captives were distributed in all the ci=

the attention of posterity, except as the preliminary steps of the approach=

ny and Scythia to the banks of the Danube, or even to the gates of Constant=
inople, the aged monarch of the Goths resigned to the brave Athanaric the d=
anger and glory of a defensive war, against an enemy who wielded with a fee=
ble hand the powers of a mighty state. A bridge of boats was established up=
on the Danube; the presence of Valens animated his troops; and his ignoranc=
e of the art of war was compensated by personal bravery and a wise deferenc=
e to the advice of Victor and Arintheus, his masters-general of the cavalry=
 and infantry. The operations of the campaign were conducted by their skill=
 and experience; but they found it impossible to drive the Visigoths from t=
heir strong posts in the mountains: and the devastation of the plains oblig=
ed the Romans themselves to repass the Danube on the approach of winter. Th=
e incessant rains, which swelled the waters of the river, produced a tacit =
suspension of arms, and confined the emperor Valens, during the whole cours=
e of the ensuing summer, to his camp of Marcianopolis. The third year of th=
e war was <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; P=
age: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>250<span class=3D"bracket">]</s=
pan></span> more favourable to the Romans and more pernicious to the Goths.=
 The interruption of trade deprived the Barbarians of the objects of luxury=
 which they already confounded with the necessaries of life; and the desola=
tion of a very extensive tract of country threatened them with the horrors =
of famine. Athanaric was provoked, or compelled, to risk a battle, which he=
 lost, in the plains; and the pursuit was rendered more bloody by the cruel=
 precaution of the victorious generals, who had promised a large reward for=
 the head of every Goth that was brought into the Imperial camp. The submis=
sion of the Barbarians appeased the resentment of Valens and his council; t=
he emperor listened with satisfaction to the flattering and eloquent remons=
trance of the senate of Constantinople, which assumed, for the first time, =
a share in the public deliberations; and the same generals, Victor and Arin=
theus, who had successfully directed the conduct of the war, were empowered=
 to regulate the conditions of peace. The freedom of trade, which the Goths=
 had hitherto enjoyed, was restricted to two cities on the Danube; the rash=
ness of their leaders was severely punished by the suppression of their pen=
sions and subsidies; and the exception, which was stipulated in favour of A=
thanaric alone, was more advantageous than honourable to the Judge of the V=
isigoths. Athanaric, who, on this occasion, appears to have consulted his p=
rivate interest, without expecting the orders of his sovereign, supported h=
is own dignity, and that of his tribe, in the personal interview which was =
proposed by the ministers of Valens. He persisted in his declaration that i=
t was impossible for him, without incurring the guilt of perjury, ever to s=
et his foot on the territory of the empire; and it is more than probable th=
at his regard for the sanctity of an oath was confirmed by the recent and f=
atal examples of Roman treachery. The Danube, which separated the dominions=
 of the two independent nations, was chosen for the scene of the conference=
. The emperor of the East and the Judge of the <span class=3D"pb"><span cla=

an equal number of armed followers, advanced in their respective barges to =
the middle of the stream. After the ratification of the treaty, and the del=
ivery of hostages, Valens returned in triumph to Constantinople; and the Go=
ths remained in a state of tranquillity about six years; till they were vio=
lently impelled against the Roman empire by an innumerable host of Scythian=

perior merit. He affected, however, to receive the modest application of Ga=
binius, king of the Quadi, with some attention and regard; but this artful =
civility concealed a dark and bloody design, and the credulous prince was p=
ersuaded to accept the pressing invitation of Marcellinus. I am at a loss h=
ow to vary the narrative of similar crimes; or how to relate that, in the c=
ourse of the same year, but in remote parts of the empire, the inhospitable=
 table of two Imperial generals was stained with the royal blood of two gue=
sts and allies, inhumanly murdered by their order and in their presence. Th=
e fate of Gabinius and of Para was the same: but the cruel death of their s=
overeign was resented in a very different manner by the servile temper of t=
he Armenians and the free and daring spirit of the Germans. The Quadi were =
much declined from that formidable power which, in the time of Marcus Anton=
inus, had spread terror to the gates of Rome. But they still possessed arms=
 and courage; their courage was animated by despair, and they obtained the =
usual reinforcement of the cavalry of their Sarmatian allies. So improviden=
t was the assassin Marcellinus that he chose the moment when the bravest ve=
terans had been drawn away to suppress the revolt of Firmus; and the whole =
province was exposed, with a very feeble defence, to the rage of the exaspe=
rated Barbarians. They invaded Pannonia in the season of harvest; unmercifu=
lly destroyed every object of plunder which they could not easily transport=
; and either disregarded or demolished the empty fortifications. The prince=

o had innocently supported the revolt of Procopius, was now the destined wi=
fe of the heir of the Western empire. She traversed the peaceful province w=
ith a splendid and unarmed train. Her person was saved from danger, and the=
 republic from disgrace, by the active zeal of Messalla, governor of the pr=
ovinces. As soon as he was informed that the village, where she stopped onl=
y to dine, was almost encompassed by the Barbarians, he hastily placed her =
in his own chariot, and drove full speed till he reached the gates of Sirmi=
um, which were at the disstance of six and twenty miles. Even Sirmium might=
 not have been secure, if the Quadi and Sarmatians had diligently advanced =
during the general consternation of the magistrates and people. Their delay=
 allowed Probus, the Pr=C3=A6torian prefect, sufficient time to recover his=
 own spirits and to revive the courage of the citizens. He skilfully direct=
ed their strenuous efforts to repair and strengthen the decayed fortificati=

rchers, to protect the capital of the Illyrian provinces. Disappointed in t=
heir attempts against the walls of Sirmium, the indignant Barbarians turned=
 their arms against the master-general of the frontier, to whom they unjust=

ket">]</span></span> which are disguised by the arts of European refinement=
 are exhibited, in their naked and most disgusting simplicity, in the tent =
of a Tartarian shepherd. The ox or the sheep are slaughtered by the same ha=
nd from which they were accustomed to receive their daily food; and the ble=
eding limbs are served, with very little preparation, on the table of their=
 unfeeling murderer. In the military profession, and especially in the cond=
uct of a numerous army, the exclusive use of animal food appears to be prod=
uctive of the most solid advantages. Corn is a bulky and perishable commodi=
ty; and the large magazines, which are indispensably necessary for the subs=
istence of our troops, must be slowly transported by the labour of men or h=
orses. But the flocks and herds, which accompany the march of the Tartars, =
afford a sure and increasing supply of flesh and milk; in the far greater p=
art of the uncultivated waste, the vegetation of the grass is quick and lux=
uriant; and there are few places so extremely barren that the hardy cattle =
of the North cannot find some tolerable pasture. The supply is multiplied a=
nd prolonged by the undistinguishing appetite and patient abstinence of the=
 Tartars. They indifferently feed on the flesh of those animals that have b=
een killed for the table or have died of disease. Horse-flesh, which in eve=
ry age and country has been proscribed by the civilised nations of Europe a=
nd Asia, they devour with peculiar greediness; and this singular taste faci=
litates the success of their military operations. The active cavalry of Scy=
thia is always followed, in their most distant and rapid incursions, by an =
adequate number of spare horses, who may be occasionally used, either to re=
double the speed, or to satisfy the hunger, of the Barbarians. Many are the=
 resources of courage and poverty. When the forage round a camp of Tartars =
is almost consumed, they slaughter the greatest part of their cattle, and p=
reserve the flesh either smoked or dried in the sun. On the sudden emergenc=
y of a hasty march, they provide themselves with a sufficient quantity of l=
ittle balls of cheese, or <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edi=
tion: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>265<span class=
=3D"bracket">]</span></span> rather of hard curd, which they occasionally d=
issolve in water; and this unsubstantial diet will support, for many days, =
the life, and even the spirits, of the patient warrior. But this extraordin=
ary abstinence, which the Stoic would approve and the hermit might envy, is=
 commonly succeeded by the most voracious indulgence of appetite. The wines=
 of a happier climate are the most grateful present, or the most valuable c=
ommodity, that can be offered to the Tartars; and the only example of their=
 industry seems to consist in the art of extracting from mares=E2=80=99 mil=
k a fermented liquor, which possesses a very strong power of intoxication. =
Like the animals of prey, the savages, both of the old and new world, exper=
ience the alternate vicissitudes of famine and plenty; and their stomach is=
 enured to sustain, without much inconvenience, the opposite extremes of hu=
nger and of intemperance.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-04_336">II. In the ages of rustic and martial simplici=
ty, a people of soldiers and husbandmen are dispersed over the face of an e=
xtensive and cultivated country, and some time must elapse before the warli=
ke youth of Greece or Italy could be assembled under the same standard, eit=
her to defend their own confines or to invade the territories of the adjace=
nt tribes. The progress of manufactures and commerce insensibly collects a =
large multitude within the walls of a city; but these citizens are no longe=
r soldiers; and the arts which adorn and improve the state of civil society=
 corrupt the habits of a military life. The pastoral manners of the Scythia=
ns seem to unite the different advantages of simplicity and refinement. The=
 individuals of the same tribe are constantly assembled, but they are assem=
bled in a camp; and the native spirit of these dauntless shepherds is anima=
ted by mutual support and emulation. The houses of the Tartars are no more =
than small tents, of an oval form, which afford a cold and dirty habitation=
 for the promiscuous youth of both sexes. The palaces of the rich consist o=
f wooden huts, of such a size that they may be conveniently fixed on large =
waggons and drawn <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: cu=
rrent; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>266<span class=3D"brack=
et">]</span></span> by a team perhaps of twenty or thirty oxen. The flocks =
and herds, after grazing all day in the adjacent pastures, retire, on the a=
pproach of night, within the protection of the camp. The necessity of preve=
nting the most mischievous confusion, in such a perpetual concourse of men =
and animals, must gradually introduce, in the distribution, the order, and =
the guard of the encampment, the rudiments of the military art. As soon as =
the forage of a certain district is consumed, the tribe, or rather army, of=
 shepherds makes a regular march to some fresh pastures; and thus acquires,=
 in the ordinary occupations of the pastoral life, the practical knowledge =
of one of the most important and difficult operations of war. The choice of=
 stations is regulated by the difference of the seasons: in the summer, the=
 Tartars advance towards the North, and pitch their tents on the banks of a=
 river, or, at least, in the neighbourhood of a running stream. But in the =
winter they return to the South, and shelter their camp behind some conveni=
ent eminence, against the winds which are chilled in their passage over the=
 bleak and icy regions of Siberia. These manners are admirably adapted to d=
iffuse, among the wandering tribes, the spirit of emigration and conquest. =
The connection between the people and their territory is of so frail a text=
ure that it may be broken by the slightest accident. The camp, and not the =
soil, is the native country of the genuine Tartar. Within the precincts of =
that camp, his family, his companions, his property, are always included; a=
nd in the most distant marches he is still surrounded by the objects which =
are dear, or valuable, or familiar in his eyes. The thirst of rapine, the f=
ear or the resentment of injury, the impatience of servitude, have, in ever=
y age, been sufficient causes to urge the tribes of Scythia boldly to advan=
ce into some unknown countries, where they might hope to find a more plenti=
ful subsistence or a less formidable enemy. The revolutions of the North ha=
ve frequently determined the fate of the South; and, in the conflict of hos=
tile nations, the victor and the vanquished have alternately drove and been=
 driven, <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Pa=

pan class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> cattle, their own leisure is seldom d=
isturbed by any servile and assiduous cares. But this leisure, instead of b=
eing devoted to the soft enjoyments of love and harmony, is usefully spent =
in the violent and sanguinary exercise of the chase. The plains of Tartary =
are filled with a strong and serviceable breed of horses, which are easily =
trained for the purposes of war and hunting. The Scythians of every age hav=
e been celebrated as bold and skilful riders; and constant practice had sea=
ted them so firmly on horseback that they were supposed by strangers to per=
form the ordinary duties of civil life, to eat, to drink, and even to sleep=
, without dismounting from their steeds. They excel in the dexterous manage=
ment of the lance; the long Tartar bow is drawn with a nervous arm; and the=
 weighty arrow is directed to its object with unerring aim and irresistible=
 force. These arrows are often pointed against the harmless animals of the =
desert, which increase and multiply in the absence of their most formidable=
 enemy: the hare, the goat, the roebuck, the fallow-deer, the stag, the elk=
, and the antelope. The vigour and patience both of the men and horses are =
continually exercised by the fatigues of the chase; and the plentiful suppl=
y of game contributes to the subsistence, and even luxury, of a Tartar camp=
. But the exploits of the hunters of Scythia are not confined to the destru=
ction of timid or innoxious beasts; they boldly encounter the angry wild bo=
ar, when he turns against his pursuers, excite the sluggish courage of the =
bear, and provoke the fury of the tiger, as he slumbers in the thicket. Whe=
re there is danger, there may be glory; and the mode of hunting which opens=
 the fairest field to the exertions of valour may justly be considered as t=
he image and as the school of war. The general hunting-matches, the pride a=
nd delight of the Tartar princes, compose an instructive exercise for their=
 numerous cavalry. A circle is drawn, of many miles in circumference, to en=
compass the game of an extensive district; and the troops that form the cir=
cle regularly advance towards a common centre; where the captive animals, s=
urrounded <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; P=
age: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>269<span class=3D"bracket">]</s=
pan></span> on every side, are abandoned to the darts of the hunters. In th=
is march, which frequently continues many days, the cavalry are obliged to =
climb the hills, to swim the rivers, and to wind through the valleys, witho=
ut interrupting the prescribed order of their gradual progress. They acquir=
e the habit of directing their eye, and their steps, to a remote object; of=
 preserving their intervals; of suspending, or accelerating, their pace, ac=
cording to the motions of the troops on their right and left; and of watchi=
ng and repeating the signals of their leaders. Their leaders study, in this=
 practical school, the most important lesson of the military art: the promp=
t and accurate judgment of ground, of distance, and of time. To employ agai=
nst a human enemy the same patience and valour, the same skill and discipli=
ne, is the only alteration which is required in real war; and the amusement=

uccessive generations, has been propagated from the same original stock. Th=
e meanest and most ignorant of the Tartars preserve, with conscious pride, =
the inestimable treasure of their genealogy; and, whatever distinctions of =

 range themselves and their followers under the formidable standard of a co=

or of power. He was raised to the throne by the acclamations of his equals;=
 and the title of <i>Khan</i> expresses, in the language of the North of As=

of the emperor would permit them to cultivate the waste lands of Thrace, th=
ey should ever hold themselves bound, by the strongest obligations of duty =
and gratitude, to obey the laws, and to guard the limits, of the republic. =
These assurances were confirmed by the ambassadors of the Goths, who impati=
ently expected, from the mouth of Valens, an answer that must finally deter=
mine the fate of their unhappy countrymen. The emperor of the East was no l=
onger guided by the wisdom and authority of his elder brother, whose death =
happened towards the end of the preceding year: and, as the distressful sit=
uation of the Goths required an instant and peremptory decision, he was dep=
rived of the favourite resource of feeble and timid minds; who consider the=
 use of dilatory and ambiguous measures as the most admirable efforts of co=
nsummate prudence. As long as the same passions and interests subsist among=
 mankind, the questions of war and peace, of justice and policy, which were=
 debated in the councils of antiquity, will frequently present themselves a=
s the subject of modern deliberation. But the most experienced statesman of=
 Europe has never been summoned to consider the propriety or the danger of =
admitting or rejecting an innumerable multitude of Barbarians, who are driv=
en by despair and hunger to solicit a settlement on the territories of a ci=
vilised nation. When that important proposition, so essentially connected w=
ith the public safety, was referred to the ministers of Valens, they were p=
erplexed and divided; but they soon acquiesced in the flattering sentiment =
which seemed the most favourable to the pride, the indolence, and the avari=
ce of their sovereign. The slaves, who were decorated with the titles of pr=
efects and generals, dissembled or disregarded the terrors of this national=
 emigration, so extremely different from the partial and accidental colonie=
s which had been received on the extreme limits of the empire. But they app=
lauded the liberality of fortune, which had conducted, from the most distan=
t countries of the globe, a numerous and <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"=

 defend the throne of Valens; who might now add to the royal treasures the =
immense sums of gold supplied by the provincials to compensate their annual=
 proportion of recruits. The prayers of the Goths were granted, and their s=
ervice was accepted by the Imperial court: and orders were immediately desp=
atched to the civil and military governors of the Thracian diocese, to make=
 the necessary preparations for the passage and subsistence of a great peop=
le, till a proper and sufficient territory could be allotted for their futu=
re residence. The liberality of the emperor was accompanied, however, with =
two harsh and rigorous conditions, which prudence might justify on the side=
 of the Romans but which distress alone could extort from the indignant Got=
hs. Before they passed the Danube, they were required to deliver their arms=
; and it was insisted that their children should be taken from them and dis=
persed through the provinces of Asia, where they might be civilised by the =
arts of education and serve as hostages to secure the fidelity of their par=

the markets were filled with the flesh of dogs, and of unclean animals, who=

, the merit of their patient and dutiful behaviour; and loudly complained o=
f the inhospitable treatment which they had received from their new allies.=
 They beheld around them the wealth and plenty of a fertile province, in th=

 separate quarters of cantonment through the interior provinces. As they we=

 Lupicinus had invited the Gothic chiefs to a splendid entertainment; and t=

 noise and brutal intemperance, Lupicinus was informed, by a secret messeng=

as he was already inflamed by wine and oppressed by sleep, he issued a rash=
 command that their death should be revenged by the massacre of the guards =

 soldier, of the life-guards of Gratian, was of the nation of the Alemanni,=
 and of the tribe of the Lentienses, who dwelt beyond the lake of Constance=
. Some domestic business obliged him to request a leave of absence. In a sh=
ort visit to his family and friends, he was exposed to their curious inquir=
ies; and the vanity of the loquacious soldier tempted him to display his in=
timate acquaintance with the secrets of the state and the designs of his ma=
ster. The intelligence that Gratian was preparing to lead the military forc=
e of Gaul and of the West to the assistance of his uncle Valens pointed out=
 to the restless spirit of the Alemanni the moment, and the mode, of a succ=
essful invasion. The enterprise of some light detachments, who, in the mont=
h of February, passed the Rhine upon the ice, was the prelude of a more imp=
ortant war. The boldest hopes of rapine, perhaps of conquest, outweighed th=
e consideration of timid prudence or national faith. Every forest and every=
 village poured forth a band of hardy adventurers; and the great army of th=
e Alemanni, which, on their approach, was estimated at forty thousand men b=

king of the Franks. His rival Priarius, king of the Alemanni, was guided, o=

an unsuccessful war. After this signal victory, which secured the peace of =

 the confines of the Alemanni, he suddenly inclined to the left, surprised =

another, till they were satisfied, by repeated trials, of the power and per=

 of their young sovereign, the prospect of a long and auspicious reign. Whe=

ith the flexible and obsequious eloquence of a courtier, represented every =
precaution and every measure that implied a doubt of immediate victory as u=
nworthy of the courage and majesty of their invincible monarch. The ruin of=
 Valens was precipitated by the deceitful arts of Fritigern and the prudent=
 admonitions of the emperor of the West. The advantages of negotiating in t=
he midst of war were perfectly understood by the general of the Barbarians;=
 and a Christian ecclesiastic was despatched, as the holy minister of peace=
, to penetrate, and to perplex, the councils of the enemy. The misfortunes,=
 as well as the provocations, of the Gothic nation were forcibly and truly =

 defence of the empire if he could secure, for his wandering countrymen, a =
tranquil settlement on the waste lands of Thrace and a sufficient allowance=
 of corn and cattle. But he added, in a whisper of confidential friendship,=
 that the exasperated Barbarians were averse to these reasonable conditions=
; and that Fritigern was doubtful whether he could accomplish the conclusio=
n of the treaty, unless he found himself supported by the presence and terr=
ors of an Imperial army. About the same time Count Richomer returned from t=
he West, to announce the defeat and submission of the Alemanni; to inform V=

 surrounded, and cut in pieces. The most skilful evolutions, the firmest co=
urage, are scarcely sufficient to extricate a body of foot, encompassed, on=
 an open plain, by superior numbers of horse; but the troops of Valens, opp=
ressed by the weight of the enemy and their own fears, were crowded into a =
narrow space, where it was impossible for them to extend their ranks, or ev=
en to use, with effect, their swords and javelins. In the midst of tumult, =
of slaughter, and of dismay, the emperor, deserted by his guards and wounde=
d, as it was supposed, with an arrow, sought protection among the Lancearii=
 and the Mattiarii, who still maintained their ground with some appearance =
of order and firmness. His faithful generals, Trajan and Victor, who percei=

 emperor could be saved. Some troops, animated by their exhortation, advanc=

 the support of a sinking world. A formidable tempest of the Barbarians of =
Germany seemed ready to burst over the provinces of Gaul; and the mind of G=

 his fidelity to a distant benefactor; and the Imperial council embraced th=

ighty state, which has been reared by the labours of successive ages, could=
 not be overturned by the misfortune of a single day, if the fatal power of=
 the imagination did not exaggerate the real measure of the calamity. The l=

have been soon recruited in the populous provinces of the East, which conta=

be the cheapest, and most common, quality of human nature; and sufficient s=
kill to encounter an undisciplined foe might have been speedily taught by t=

horses, and equipped with the armour, of their vanquished enemies, the nume=

alry; the thirty-four arsenals of the empire were plentifully stored with m=
agazines of offensive and defensive arms; and the wealth of Asia might stil=

hich were produced by the battle of Hadrianople on the minds of the Barbari=

of the latter, far beyond the limits of a single day. A Gothic chief was he=

E. Nestle, Byz. Zeitschrift, iv. p. 319-345, who makes it probable that the=
 original Helena legend was in Syriac, and prints the oldest Greek version =
extant from a Sinai MS. of the eighth century copied by Mr. Rendel Harris. =

=E2=80=9D [There is no question that the Acta (in Act. Sanct. 23rd April) a=
re apocryphal and legendary. They are remarkable for the horrible descripti=
ons of scenes of martyrdom, which might serve as a text to elucidate the pi=
ctures on the walls of the curious round Church of San Stefano on the Esqui=
line.] G=C3=B6rres arrives at practically the same conclusion as Tillemont =
(M=C3=A9m. eccl., v. 185-9, 658-60). All the details of St. George=E2=80=99=
s martyrdom are uncertain; but St. George existed and suffered as a martyr =
in the East in some pre-Constantinian persecution. Tillemont established th=
e reality of St. George by the existence of his cult (he was a =CE=BC=CE=B5=
=CE=B3=CE=B1=CE=BB=CF=8C=CE=BC=CE=B1=CF=81=CF=84=CF=85=CF=82) in the sixth =
century; G=C3=B6rres proves that it already existed in the fifth century. (=
1) The round Church of St. George at Thessalonica is not younger than the f=
ifth century and possibly belongs to the fourth; (2) Venantius (Carm. ii. 1=
2, p. 41, ed. M.H.G.) mentions a Gallic basilica to St. George, founded by =
Sidonius Apollinaris; (3) the decree of Pope Gelasius <i>de libris non reci=
piendis,</i> at end of fifth century, condemns the Acta of St. George as ap=
ocryphal, but confesses his historical existence.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-04_367">The connection of his name with a dragon-slayi=
ng legend does not relegate him to the region of myth. For over against the=
 fabulous Christian dragonslayer, Theodore of the Bithynian Heraclea, we ca=
n set Agapetus of Synnada and Arsacius, who though celebrated as dragon-sla=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-04_368">Gibbon=E2=80=99s theory which identifies St. G=
eorge with George of Cappadocia has nothing to be said for it; but G=C3=B6r=
res points out that it is not open to any objection on the ground that Geor=
ge of Cappadocia was an Arian. For there are examples of Arians admitted in=
to the Martyrologium: he cites Agapetus of Synnada and Auxentius, afterward=
s bishop of Mopsuestia. (It is to be noted that one recension of the Acta S=

=80=94 (<span class=3D"ptr">P. 75</span>)</h2>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-04_369">In regard to Constantine=E2=80=99s Churches at=
 Jerusalem it may be said, without entering upon the question as to the tru=
e positions of Golgotha and the Holy Sepulchre, that it is certain that the=
se Churches =E2=80=94 (1) the round Church of the Anastasis which contained=
 the Sepulchre, and the (2) adjacent Basilica, dedicated to the Cross =E2=
=80=94 stood on the site of the present Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Injur=
ed by the Persians (614 <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</sp=
an></span>) they were restored some years later, and a plan of the building=
s drawn up, towards the end of the seventh century, by the pilgrim Arculfus=
 is extant, and is of great importance for the topography. Some traces of t=
he old buildings still remain. =E2=80=9CThe relative position of the Church=
es is the same; the circular Church of the Anastasis has preserved its form=
; the south wall of the Basilica can be traced from =E2=80=98Calvary=E2=80=
=99 eastward, and one of the large cisterns constructed by Constantine has =
been discovered=E2=80=9D (Sir C. Wilson, in Smith=E2=80=99s Dict. of the Bi=
ble, new ed., 1893, p. 1654). Mr. Fergusson=E2=80=99s theory which identifi=
ed the Church of the Resurrection with the mosque known as Kubbet-es-Sakhra=
h, the Dome of the Rock (within the so-called =E2=80=9CHaram area=E2=80=9D)=
, is now quite exploded.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-04_370">The Dome of the Rock has its own question, but=
 has nothing to do with Constantine. Is it of Saracenic origin dating from =
the end of the seventh century =E2=80=94 built perhaps by a Greek architect=
? or was it originally a Christian Church, and converted into a mosque? It =
has been identified by Professor Sepp with a Church of St. Sophia built by =
Justinian. Sir C. Wilson thinks that it stands on the site of St. Sophia, w=
hich was destroyed by the Persians; =E2=80=9Cthat it was rebuilt with the o=
ld material by Abdul-Melik who covered it with a dome, and that it was agai=
n repaired and redecorated by El Mam=C3=BBn=E2=80=9D (<i>ib.,</i> p. 1657).=
</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-04_371">The adjacent mosque el-Aksa occupies the site =
of the mosque of Omar. It was built by Abd al Malik, =E2=80=9Cout of the ru=
ins of Justinian=E2=80=99s Church of St. Mary=E2=80=9D (Wilson, <i>ib.</i>)=
, which is fully described by Procopius; but there is a difference of opini=
on whether the Church was on the same site as the mosque or (so Fergusson a=
nd others) in the south-eastern corner of the =E2=80=9CHaram area,=E2=80=9D=
 where there are vaults apparently of the Justinianean age.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-04_373">The recent publication of a geographical descr=
iption of Mesopotamia and Baghd=C4=81d by an Arabic writer, Ibn Serapion, o=
f whom nothing is known except that he wrote in the early years of the tent=

enda in July, and 1896, October), is of considerable importance.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-04_374">It shows that since the tenth century great al=
terations have taken place in the course of the Tigris and Euphrates, and s=
hows what these alterations were; it gives a clear account of the canal sys=
tem which drew the overflow of the Euphrates into the Tigris; and it suppli=
es most important data for the reconstruction of the topography of Baghd=C4=
=81d.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-04_375">Before the Caliphate, the River Tigris followe=
d its present course, from K=C5=ABt-al-Amarah (about 100 miles below Baghd=
=C4=81d) flowing in a south-easterly direction to its junction with the Eup=
hrates. But during the middle ages =E2=80=94 in the tenth century for examp=
le =E2=80=94 it flowed almost due south, =E2=80=9Crunning down the channel =
now known as the Sha<i>tt</i>-al-Hay, and passing through the city of W=C4=
=81si<i>t</i>=E2=80=9D (Le Strange, <i>ib.,</i> Jan., p. 3). The changes in=
 the Euphrates are thus summed up by Mr. Le Strange (p. 4): A little above =
Al-K=C5=ABfa =E2=80=9Cthe stream bifurcated. The branch to the right =E2=80=
=94 considered then as the main stream of the Euphrates, but now known as t=
he Hindiyya Canal =E2=80=94 ran down past Al-K=C5=ABfa, and a short distanc=
e below the city became lost in the western part of the great Swamp,=E2=80=
=9D which also swallowed up the waters of the Tigris. =E2=80=9CThe stream t=
o the left or eastward called the S=C5=ABr=C4=81 Canal =E2=80=94 which, in =
its upper reach, follows the line of the modern Euphrates =E2=80=94 ran a s=
hort course and then split up into numerous canals whose waters for the mos=
t part flowed out into the Tigris above W=C4=81si<i>t.</i>=E2=80=9D The gre=
at Swamp in which the streams of both Tigris and Euphrates lost themselves =
was drained by the Tidal Estuary which reached the sea at Abbad=C4=81n, =E2=
=80=9Ca town which, on account of the recession of the Persian Gulf, now li=
es nearly twenty miles distant from the present shore-line.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-04_376">It should be carefully remembered in reading t=
he account of the events after Julian=E2=80=99s death that the Tigris has a=
lso altered its course to the north of Ctesiphon since the tenth century. F=
rom a point below Samarr=C4=81 to a point above Baghd=C4=81d, it followed a=
 shorter and more westerly channel than at the present day.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-04_377">As to the canal Nahr-al-Malik (see above, p. 1=
37), Mr. Le Strange says (<i>ib.,</i> Jan., p. 75), that =E2=80=9Croughly s=
peaking it followed the line of the modern Radhw=C4=81niyya Canal.=E2=80=9D=
</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-04_378">It may be added that the geographical work of =
Abu-l-Fid=C4=81, mentioned by Gibbon, p. 127, n. 54, is not very valuable, =
being neither good nor early. The authoritative Arabic text is that of Rein=
aud, 1840, and there is a French translation by S. Guyard, 1883. On early g=

 Clemens =E2=80=94 the first distinctly Christian Latin poet =E2=80=94 was =
a Spaniard by birth (born <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</=
span></span> 348). He gave up a secular career at the age of fifty-seven an=
d spent the remainder of his life in composing Christian poetry. For histor=
ical purposes his most important work is the <i>Contra Symmachum</i> in two=
 Books, on the question of the Altar of Victory. It is important to determi=
ne the date of this work. It seems decisive (as Birt has observed in his Pr=
eface to Claudian) that in Bk. ii. Prudentius sings of the victory over Ala=
ric at Pollentia but does not mention the triumph of Verona (see below, vol=
. v. Appendix 9). It follows that the work <i>Contra Symmachum</i> appeared=
 between May 402 and August 403; another inference is that Symmachus was al=
ive (cp. Gibbon, chap. xxviii. n. 22) in the year 402-3. (Birt points out a=
 number of verbal echoes which show that the muse of the Christian poet was=
 stimulated by the =E2=80=9CGothic War=E2=80=9D of the pagan.) It seems hig=
hly probable that this controversial poem was called forth by an actual per=
mission granted by Honorius to restore the Altar of Victory in <span class=

admirable chapter on the book) =E2=80=9Cone of our most valuable sources of=
 information as to the inner life of the dying Empire and the moral charact=
er of its foes.=E2=80=9D Salvian was a presbyter of Massilia. He was marrie=
d, but after the birth of a daughter he and his wife took a vow of chastity=
 for life. He seems to have been born c. 400 and was still living in 480. H=
e wrote his book before the middle of the century.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-04_480">The purpose of this book was to answer the gre=
at problem which at that time was perplexing thoughtful people: Why is civi=
lised society dissolving and breaking up before the barbarians, if there is=
 a Divine governance of the world? This question had been dealt with before=
 by Augustine in the De Civitate Dei, and by Orosius in the Hist. adversus =
Paganos. Their various answers have been well compared by Mr. Hodgkin. Augu=
stine=E2=80=99s answer was merely negative: the evils which had come upon R=
ome were not the effect of the introduction of Christianity. Orosius denied=
 the existence of the evils. But a good deal had happened between 417 and 4=
40; and in 440 even Orosius could hardly have ventured to maintain his thes=
is. Salvian=E2=80=99s answer was: these evils are the effects of our vices.=
 He draws a vivid and highly exaggerated contrast between Roman vices and T=

enty years as a monk on the Mount of Olives. During this period he became a=
cquainted with Bacurius the first Christian king of the Iberians, and with =
Oedesius the companion of Frumentius, the apostle of the Ethiopians. He ret=
urned to Italy in 397 and spent the later part of his life at Aquileia. Thi=

 The controversy arose out of certain references to Jerome in the Preface t=

ty of Jerome=E2=80=99s name to cover heretical doctrines of Origen. The mos=
t important works of Rufinus are his Ecclesiastical History in two Books, b=

by Mr. Wylie (at Sir H. Howorth=E2=80=99s request) and published in the thi=
rd and fourth volumes of the Journal of the Anthropol. Institute. Sir H. Ho=
worth wrote a preface, arguing that the Hiung-Nu cannot be identified with =
the Huns. His argument is: the Hiung-Nu were Turks; the Huns were Ugrians; =
therefore the Huns were not Hiung-Nu. =E2=80=9CThe Huns, as I have elsewher=
e argued, were a race of Ugrians led by a caste of another race now represe=
nted by some of the Lesghian tribes of the Caucasus. The Hiung-Nu were not =
Ugrians. It was Klaproth, whose grasp of the whole subject of the ethnograp=
hy of Northern Asia was most masterly, and who, notwithstanding some failur=
es, I hold to have been <i>facile princeps</i> among Asiatic ethnologists, =
first proved that the Hiung-Nu were Turks, and his conclusions were endorse=
d by the very competent authority of Abel Remusat, and since by other schol=
ars.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-04_506">That the Hiung-Nu were a Turkic race (the corr=
ect way of stating it is: the Turks were Hiung-Nu) may indeed be regarded a=
s certain; but so much cannot be said of Sir H. Howorth=E2=80=99s other pre=
miss, that the Huns were Ugrians.</p>
<span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </spa=

>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-04_507">For Klaproth=E2=80=99s proof that the Huns wer=
e Lesghians, see his Tableaux historiques de l=E2=80=99Asie, and Howorth, J=
ournal Anth. Inst. iii. p. 453-4. His comparative list of Hunnic and Lesghi=
an names presents such strikingly close resemblances that it is hard to res=
ist his conclusions; and his identification of the Hunnic <i>var</i> =E2=80=
=9Criver=E2=80=9D (Jordanes, <i>Get.</i> 52) with Lesghian <i>or, ouor,</i>=
 is plausible. While admitting that the Huns may be connected with this Cau=
casian race, I cannot follow Sir H. Howorth in his further speculations, or=
 admit that an affinity has been proved with the Finno-Ugrian languages. Si=
r H. Howorth=E2=80=99s comparative table of Hunnic with Hungarian names (p.=
 470) is quite unconvincing.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-04_508">On the other hand I cannot accept as proven, o=
r as more than a brilliant conjecture, the identification of the Huns with =
the Hiung-Nu. The thesis has been recently defended by Mr. E. H. Parker, a =
Chinese scholar, whose work I have used and referred to in additional footn=
otes on Gibbon=E2=80=99s account of the Hiung-Nu in this volume. In =E2=80=
=9CA Thousand Years of the Tartars,=E2=80=9D p. 99, Mr. Parker puts it thus=
: The Northern Hiung-Nu, unable to maintain their ground against various en=
emies, =E2=80=9Cdisappeared far away to the North, many of them no doubt fi=
nding their way by the upper waters of the Selinga and the Irtysh to Isseku=
l, the Aral, and the Caspian, struggling with the Bashkirs, the Alans, and =
the unknown tribes then occupying Russia into Europe.=E2=80=9D And again in=
 an article on =E2=80=9CThe Origin of the Turks=E2=80=9D in the English His=
t. Review, July, 1896, p. 434, he defends the view that =E2=80=9Cthe Hiung-=
Nu were in fact the Huns, who afterwards appeared as the Hunni in Europe.=
=E2=80=9D</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-04_509">While I am not convinced that on the ethnograp=
hical side there is any a priori objection to the identification of the Hun=
s with the =E2=80=9CHiung=E2=80=9D slaves =E2=80=94 Mr. Parker observes tha=
t to this day Hiung =E2=80=9Cis in some parts of China still pronounced <i>=
Hiln</i>=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 I cannot, from the historical side, see the jus=
tification for asserting the identity. The resemblance of the name is in fa=
ct the only proof. It is a mortal leap from the kingdom of the northern Zen=
ghi to the steppes of Russia, and he who takes it is supported on the wings=
 of fancy, not on the ground of fact. On this question research in the Chin=
ese annals has added nothing to the data which were so ably manipulated by =
Deguignes.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-04_510">The Geougen, who will be more important afterw=
ards in connection with the Turks (see chapter xlii.), were wrongly identif=
ied with the Avars by Deguignes. Mr. Parker (Eng. Hist. Rev. <i>loc. cit.</=
i> p. 435) is unable to decide whether they were of Hunnic or Tungusic orig=
in, and suspects a mixture of both races.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-04_511">The close connection of the Huns and Avars see=
ms clear. Professor V=C3=A1mb=C3=A9ry in his <i>A Magyarok Eredete</i> (188=
2), p. 415 <i>sqq.,</i> has collected the Hun and Avar words and names that=
 can be gleaned from literature, and attempted to interpret them by the hel=
p of Turkish. His list however is not complete.</p>

9, 39). His triumph over two emperors (the first fabulous, the second histo=
rical) is diffusely celebrated by Chrysostom (tom. ii. p. 536-579, edit. Mo=

qq.</i>), who uncovers a nest of errors in the account of Gibbon. (1) From =
Sozomen, v. 20, it is clear that persecutions intervened between the proces=

ong in stating that the fire broke out =E2=80=9Cduring the night which term=

ian=E2=80=99s uncle, Count Julian (Soz. v. 8; Ruinart, Acta Mart. Sinc. p. =
605 <i>sqq.</i>). (3) Ammian=E2=80=99s expression <i>levissimus rumor</i> r=
elates not to the charge against Christians, but to the story that the fire=
 was accidentally caused by the philosopher Asclepiades. Gibbon wrongly con=
nected <i>hac ex causa</i> with the preceding sentence: Amm. 22, 13, 3. (4)=
 Babylas, removed by Julian=E2=80=99s orders, was placed in his former <i>m=
