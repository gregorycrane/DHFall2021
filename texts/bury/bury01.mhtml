w. e. h. lecky</span></p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_397"><span class=3D"csc">The</span> history of Gibb=
on has been described by John Stuart Mill as the only eighteenth-century hi=
story that has withstood nineteenth-century criticism; and whatever objecti=
ons modern critics may bring against some of its parts, the substantial jus=
tice of this verdict will scarcely be contested. No other history of that c=
entury has been so often reprinted, annotated, and discussed, or remains to=
 the present day a capital authority on the great period of which it treats=
. As a composition it stands unchallenged and conspicuous among the masterp=
ieces of English literature, while as a history it covers a space of more t=
han twelve hundred years, including some of the most momentous events in th=
e annals of mankind.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_398">Gibbon was born at Putney, Surrey, April 27, 1=
737. Though his father was a member of Parliament and the owner of a modera=
te competence, the author of this great work was essentially a self-educate=
d man. Weak health and almost constant illness in early boyhood broke up hi=
s school life, =E2=80=94 which appears to have been fitfully and most imper=
fectly conducted, =E2=80=94 withdrew him from boyish games, but also gave h=
im, as it has given to many other shy and sedentary boys, an early and inve=
terate passion for reading. His reading, however, was very unlike that of a=
n ordinary boy. He has given a graphic picture of the ardour with which, wh=
en he was only fourteen, he flung himself into serious but unguided study; =
which was at first purely desultory, but <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"=
decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>=
xviii<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> gradually contracted into hist=
oric lines, and soon concentrated itself mainly on that Oriental history wh=
ich he was one day so brilliantly to illuminate. =E2=80=9CBefore I was sixt=
een,=E2=80=9D he says, =E2=80=9CI had exhausted all that could be learned i=
n English of the Arabs and Persians, the Tartars and Turks; and the same ar=
dour led me to guess at the French of D=E2=80=99Herbelot, and to construe t=
he barbarous Latin of Pocock=E2=80=99s =E2=80=98Abulfaragius.=E2=80=99=E2=
=80=9D</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_399">His health, however, gradually improved, and w=
hen he entered Magdalen College, Oxford, it might have been expected that a=
 new period of intellectual development would have begun; but Oxford had at=
 this time sunk to the lowest depth of stagnation, and to Gibbon it proved =
extremely uncongenial. He complained that he found no guidance, no stimulus=
, and no discipline, and that the fourteen months he spent there were the m=
ost idle and unprofitable of his life. They were very unexpectedly cut shor=
t by his conversion to the Roman Catholic faith, which he formally adopted =
at the age of sixteen.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_400">This conversion is, on the whole, the most sur=
prising incident of his calm and uneventful life. The tendencies of the tim=
e, both in England and on the Continent, were in a wholly different directi=
on. The more spiritual and emotional natures were now passing into the reli=
gious revival of Wesley and Whitefield, which was slowly transforming the c=
haracter of the Anglican Church and laying the foundations of the great Eva=
ngelical party. In other quarters the predominant tendencies were towards u=
nbelief, scepticism, or indifference. Nature seldom formed a more sceptical=
 intellect than that of Gibbon, and he was utterly without the spiritual in=
sight, or spiritual cravings, or overmastering enthusiasms, that produce an=
d explain most religious changes. Nor was he in the least drawn towards Cat=
holicism on its =C3=A6sthetic side. He had never come in contact with its w=
orship or its professors; and to his unimaginative, unimpassioned, and prof=
oundly intellectual temperament, no ideal type could be <span class=3D"pb">=
<span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"br=
acket">[</span>xix<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> more uncongenial =
than that of the saint. He had, however, from early youth been keenly inter=
ested in theological controversies. He argued, like Lardner and Paley, that=
 miracles are the Divine attestation of orthodoxy. Middleton convinced him =
that unless the Patristic writers were wholly undeserving of credit, the gi=
ft of miracles continued in the Church during the fourth and fifth centurie=
s; and he was unable to resist the conclusion that during that period many =
of the leading doctrines of Catholicism had passed into the Church. The wri=
tings of the Jesuit Parsons, and still more the writings of Bossuet, comple=
ted the work which Middleton had begun. Having arrived at this conclusion, =
Gibbon acted on it with characteristic honesty, and was received into the C=
hurch on the 8th of June, 1753.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_401">The English universities were at this time pur=
ely Anglican bodies, and the conversion of Gibbon excluded him from Oxford.=
 His father judiciously sent him to Lausanne to study with a Swiss pastor n=
amed Pavilliard, with whom he spent five happy and profitable years. The th=
eological episode was soon terminated. Partly under the influence of his te=
acher, but much more through his own reading and reflections, he soon disen=
tangled the purely intellectual ties that bound him to the Church of Rome; =
and on Christmas Day, 1754, he received the sacrament in the Protestant chu=
rch of Lausanne.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_402">His residence at Lausanne was very useful to h=
im. He had access to books in abundance, and his tutor, who was a man of gr=
eat good sense and amiability but of no remarkable capacity, very judicious=
ly left his industrious pupil to pursue his studies in his own way. =E2=80=
=9CHiving wisdom with each studious year,=E2=80=9D as Byron so truly says, =
he speedily amassed a store of learning which has seldom been equalled. His=
 insatiable love of knowledge, his rare capacity for concentrated, accurate=
, and fruitful study, guided by a singularly sure and masculine judgment, s=
oon made him, in the true sense of the word, one of the best scholars of hi=
s time. His learning, <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition=
: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>xx<span class=3D"br=
acket">]</span></span> however, was not altogether of the kind that may be =
found in a great university professor. Though the classical languages becam=
e familiar to him, he never acquired or greatly valued the minute and finis=
hed scholarship which is the boast of the chief English schools; and carefu=
l students have observed that in following Greek books he must have very la=
rgely used the Latin translations. Perhaps in his capacity of historian thi=
s deficiency was rather an advantage than the reverse. It saved him from th=
e exaggerated value of classical form, and from the neglect of the more cor=
rupt literatures, to which English scholars have been often prone. Gibbon a=
lways valued books mainly for what they contained, and he had early learned=
 the lesson which all good historians should learn: that some of his most v=
aluable materials will be found in literatures that have no artistic merit;=
 in writers who, without theory and almost without criticism, simply relate=
 the facts which they have seen, and express in unsophisticated language th=
e beliefs and impressions of their time.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_403">Lausanne and not Oxford was the real birthplac=
e of his intellect, and he returned from it almost a foreigner. French had =
become as familiar to him as his own tongue; and his first book, a somewhat=
 superficial essay on the study of literature, was published in the French =
language. The noble contemporary French literature filled him with delight,=
 and he found on the borders of the Lake of Geneva a highly cultivated soci=
ety to which he was soon introduced, and which probably gave him more real =
pleasure than any in which he afterwards moved. With Voltaire himself he ha=
d some slight acquaintance, and he at one time looked on him with profound =
admiration; though fuller knowledge made him sensible of the flaws in that =
splendid intellect. I am here concerned with the life of Gibbon only in as =
far as it discloses the influences that contributed to his master work, and=
 among these influences the foreign element holds a prominent place. There =
was little in Gibbon that was distinctively <span class=3D"pb"><span class=
=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</s=
pan>xxi<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> English; his mind was essent=
ially cosmopolitan. His tastes, ideals, and modes of thought and feeling tu=
rned instinctively to the Continent.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_404">In one respect this foreign type was of great =
advantage to his work. Gibbon excels all other English historians in symmet=
ry, proportion, perspective, and arrangement, which are also the pre=C3=ABm=
inent and characteristic merits of the best French literature. We find in h=
is writing nothing of the great miscalculations of space that were made by =
such writers as Macaulay and Buckle; nothing of the awkward repetitions, th=
e confused arrangement, the semi-detached and disjointed episodes that mar =
the beauty of many other histories of no small merit. Vast and multifarious=
 as are the subjects which he has treated, his work is a great whole, admir=
ably woven in all its parts. On the other hand, his foreign taste may perha=
ps be seen in his neglect of the Saxon element, which is the most vigorous =
and homely element in English prose. Probably in no other English writer do=
es the Latin element so entirely predominate. Gibbon never wrote an unmeani=
ng and very seldom an obscure sentence; he could always paint with sustaine=
d and stately eloquence an illustrious character or a splendid scene: but h=
e was wholly wanting in the grace of simplicity, and a monotony of glitter =
and of mannerism is the great defect of his style. He possessed, to a degre=
e which even Tacitus and Bacon had hardly surpassed, the supreme literary g=
ift of condensation, and it gives an admirable force and vividness to his n=
arrative; but it is sometimes carried to excess. Not unfrequently it is att=
ained by an excessive allusiveness, and a wide knowledge of the subject is =
needed to enable the reader to perceive the full import and meaning conveye=
d or hinted at by a mere turn of phrase. But though his style is artificial=
 and pedantic, and greatly wanting in flexibility, it has a rare power of c=
linging to the memory, and it has profoundly influenced English prose. That=
 excellent judge, Cardinal Newman, has said of Gibbon, =E2=80=9CI seem to t=
race his vigorous <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: cu=
rrent; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>xxii<span class=3D"brac=
ket">]</span></span> condensation and peculiar rhythm at every turn in the =
literature of the present day.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_405">It is not necessary to relate here in any deta=
il the later events of the life of Gibbon. There was his enlistment as capt=
ain in the Hampshire militia. It involved two and a half years of active se=
rvice, extending from May, 1760, to December, 1762; and as Gibbon afterward=
s acknowledged, if it interrupted his studies and brought him into very unc=
ongenial duties and societies, it at least greatly enlarged his acquaintanc=
e with English life, and also gave him a knowledge of the rudiments of mili=
tary science, which was not without its use to the historian of so many bat=
tles. There was a long journey, lasting for two years and five months, in F=
rance and Italy, which greatly confirmed his foreign tendencies. In Paris h=
e moved familiarly in some of the best French literary society; and in Rome=
, as he tells us in a well-known passage, while he sat =E2=80=9Cmusing amid=
st the ruins of the Capitol while the barefooted friars were singing vesper=
s in the Temple of Jupiter=E2=80=9D (which is now the Church of the Ara C=
=C5=93li), =E2=80=94 on October 15, 1764, =E2=80=94 he first conceived the =
idea of writing the history of the decline and fall of Rome.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_406">There was also that very curious episode in hi=
s life, lasting from 1774 to 1782, =E2=80=94 his appearance in the House of=
 Commons. He had declined an offer of his father=E2=80=99s to purchase a se=
at for him in 1760; and fourteen years later, when his father was dead, whe=
n his own circumstances were considerably contracted, he received and accep=
ted at the hands of a family connection the offer of a seat. His Parliament=
ary career was entirely undistinguished, and he never even opened his mouth=
 in debate, =E2=80=94 a fact which was not forgotten when very recently ano=
ther historian was candidate for a seat in Parliament. In truth, this somew=
hat shy and reserved scholar, with his fastidious taste, his eminently judi=
cial mind, and his highly condensed and elaborate style, was singularly unf=
it for the rough work of Parliamentary discussion. No one can read his book=
s without perceiving <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition:=
 current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>xxiii<span class=3D"=
bracket">]</span></span> that his English was not that of a debater; and he=
 has candidly admitted that he entered Parliament without public spirit or =
serious interest in politics, and that he valued it chiefly as leading to a=
n office which might restore the fortune which the extravagance of his fath=
er had greatly impaired. His only real public service was the composition i=
n French of a reply to the French manifesto which was issued at the beginni=
ng of the war of 1778. He voted steadily and placidly as a Tory, and it is =
not probable that in doing so he did any violence to his opinions. Like Hum=
e, he shrank with an instinctive dislike from all popular agitations, from =
all turbulence, passion, exaggeration, and enthusiasm; and a temperate and =
well-ordered despotism was evidently his ideal. He showed it in the well-kn=
own passage in which he extols the benevolent despotism of the Antonines as=
 without exception the happiest period in the history of mankind, and in th=
e unmixed horror with which he looked upon the French Revolution that broke=
 up the old landmarks of Europe. For three years he held an office in the B=
oard of Trade, which added considerably to his income without adding greatl=
y to his labours, and he supported steadily the American policy of Lord Nor=
th and the Coalition ministry of North and Fox; but the loss of his office =
and the retirement of North soon drove him from Parliament, and he shortly =
after took up his residence at Lausanne.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_407">But before this time a considerable part of hi=
s great work had been accomplished. The first quarto volume of the =E2=80=
=9CDecline and Fall=E2=80=9D appeared in February, 1776. As is usually the =
case with historical works, it occupied a much longer period than its succe=
ssors, and was the fruit of about ten years of labour. It passed rapidly th=
rough three editions, received the enthusiastic eulogy of Hume and Robertso=
n, and was no doubt greatly assisted in its circulation by the storm of con=
troversy that arose about his Fifteenth and Sixteenth Chapters. In April, 1=
781, two more volumes appeared, and the three concluding volumes were publi=
shed <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: =
</span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>xxiv<span class=3D"bracket">]</span>=
</span> together on the 8th of May, 1788, being the fifty-first birthday of=
 the author.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_408">A work of such magnitude, dealing with so vast=
 a variety of subjects, was certain to exhibit some flaws. The controversy =
at first turned mainly upon its religious tendency. The complete scepticism=
 of the author, his aversion to the ecclesiastical type which dominated in =
the period of which he wrote, and his unalterable conviction that Christian=
ity, by diverting the strength and enthusiasm of the Empire from civic into=
 ascetic and ecclesiastical channels, was a main cause of the downfall of t=
he Empire and of the triumph of barbarism, gave him a bias which it was imp=
ossible to overlook. On no other subject is his irony more bitter or his co=
ntempt so manifestly displayed. Few good critics will deny that the growth =
of the ascetic spirit had a large part in corroding and enfeebling the civi=
c virtues of the Empire; but the part which it played was that of intensify=
ing a disease that had already begun, and Gibbon, while exaggerating the am=
ount of the evil, has very imperfectly described the great services rendere=
d even by a monastic Church in laying the basis of another civilisation and=
 in mitigating the calamities of the barbarian invasion. The causes he has =
given of the spread of Christianity in the Fifteenth Chapter were for the m=
ost part true causes, but there were others of which he was wholly insensib=
le. The strong moral enthusiasms that transform the character and inspire o=
r accelerate all great religious changes lay wholly beyond the sphere of hi=
s realisations. His language about the Christian martyrs is the most repuls=
ive portion of his work; and his comparison of the sufferings caused by pag=
an and Christian persecutions is greatly vitiated by the fact that he only =
takes account of the number of deaths, and lays no stress on the profuse em=
ployment of atrocious tortures, which was one of the most distinct features=
 of the pagan persecutions. At the same time, though Gibbon displays in thi=
s field a manifest and a distorting bias, he never, like some of his French=
 contemporaries, <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: cur=
rent; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>xxv<span class=3D"bracke=
t">]</span></span> sinks into the mere partisan, awarding to one side unqua=
lified eulogy and to the other unqualified contempt. Let the reader who dou=
bts this examine and compare his masterly portraits of Julian and of Athana=
sius, and he will perceive how clearly the great historian could recognise =
weaknesses in the characters by which he was most attracted, and elements o=
f true greatness in those by which he was most repelled. A modern writer, i=
n treating of the history of religions, would have given a larger space to =
comparative religion, and to the gradual, unconscious, and spontaneous grow=
th of myths in the twilight periods of the human mind. These, however, were=
 subjects which were scarcely known in the days of Gibbon, and he cannot be=
 blamed for not having discussed them.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_409">Another class of objections which has been bro=
ught against him is that he is weak upon the philosophical side, and deals =
with history mainly as a mere chronicle of events, and not as a chain of ca=
uses and consequences, a series of problems to be solved, a gradual evoluti=
on which it is the task of the historian to explain. Coleridge, who deteste=
d Gibbon and spoke of him with gross injustice, has put this objection in t=
he strongest form. He accuses him of having reduced history to a mere colle=
ction of splendid anecdotes; of noting nothing but what may produce an effe=
ct; of skipping from eminence to eminence without ever taking his readers t=
hrough the valleys between; of having never made a single philosophical att=
empt to fathom the ultimate causes of the decline and fall of the Roman Emp=
ire, which is the very subject of his history. That such charges are grossl=
y exaggerated will be apparent to any one who will carefully read the Secon=
d and Third Chapters, describing the state and tendencies of the Empire und=
er the Antonines; or the chapters devoted to the rise and character of the =
barbarians, to the spread of Christianity, to the influence of monasticism,=
 to the jurisprudence of the republic, and of the Empire; nor would it be d=
ifficult to collect many acute and profound philosophical <span class=3D"pb=
"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"=
bracket">[</span>xxvi<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> remarks from o=
ther portions of the history. Still, it may be admitted that the philosophi=
cal side is not its strongest part. Social and economical changes are somet=
imes inadequately examined and explained, and we often desire fuller inform=
ation about the manners and life of the masses of the people. As far as con=
cerns the age of the Antonines, this want has been amply supplied by the gr=
eat work of Friedl=C3=A4nder.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_410">History, like many other things in our generat=
ion, has fallen largely into the hands of specialists; and it is inevitable=
 that men who have devoted their lives to a minute examination of short per=
iods should be able to detect some deficiencies and errors in a writer who =
traversed a period of more than twelve hundred years. Many generations of s=
cholars have arisen since Gibbon; many new sources of knowledge have become=
 available, and arch=C3=A6ology especially has thrown a flood of new light =
on some of the subjects he treated. Though his knowledge and his narrative =
are on the whole admirably sustained, there are periods which he knew less =
well and treated less fully than others. His account of the Crusades is gen=
erally acknowledged to be one of the most conspicuous of these, and within =
the last few years there has arisen a school of historians who protest agai=
nst the low opinion of the Byzantine Empire which was held by Gibbon, and w=
as almost universal among scholars till the present generation. That these =
writers have brought into relief certain merits of the Lower Empire which G=
ibbon had neglected, will not be denied; but it is perhaps too early to dec=
ide whether the reaction has not, like most reactions, been carried to extr=
avagance, and whether in its general features the estimate of Gibbon is not=
 nearer the truth than some of those which are now put forward to replace i=
t.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_411">Much must no doubt be added to the work of Gib=
bon in order to bring it up to the level of our present knowledge; but ther=
e is no sign that any single work is likely to supersede <span class=3D"pb"=
><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"b=
racket">[</span>xxvii<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> it or to rende=
r it useless to the student; nor does its survival depend only or even main=
ly on its great literary qualities, which have made it one of the classics =
of the language. In some of these qualities Hume was the equal of Gibbon an=
d in others his superior, and he brought to his history a more penetrating =
and philosophical intellect and an equally calm and unenthusiastic nature; =
but the study which Hume bestowed on his subject was so superficial and his=
 statements were often so inaccurate, that his work is now never quoted as =
an authority. With Gibbon it is quite otherwise. His marvellous industry, h=
is almost unrivalled accuracy of detail, his sincere love of truth, his rar=
e discrimination and insight in weighing testimony and in judging character=
, have given him a secure place among the greatest historians of the world.=
</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_412">His life lasted only fifty-six years; he died =
in London on January 15, 1794. Gibbon=E2=80=99s autobiography is one of the=
 best specimens of self-portraiture in the language, reflecting with pelluc=
id clearness both the life and character, the merits and defects, of its au=
thor. He was certainly neither a hero nor a saint; nor did he possess the m=
oral and intellectual qualities that dominate in the great conflicts of lif=
e, sway the passions of men, appeal powerfully to the imagination, or dazzl=
e and impress in social intercourse. He was a little slow, a little pompous=
, a little affected and pedantic. In the general type of his mind and chara=
cter he bore much more resemblance to Hume, Adam Smith, or Reynolds, than t=
o Johnson or Burke. A reserved scholar, who was rather proud of being a man=
 of the world; a confirmed bachelor, much wedded to his comforts though car=
ing nothing for luxury, he was eminently moderate in his ambitions, and the=
re was not a trace of passion or enthusiasm in his nature. Such a man was n=
ot likely to inspire any strong devotion. But his temper was most kindly, e=
quable, and contented; he was a steady friend, and he appears to have been =
always liked and honoured in the cultivated and uncontentious <span class=
=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span cla=
ss=3D"bracket">[</span>xxviii<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> societ=
y in which he delighted. His life was not a great one, but it was in all es=
sentials blameless and happy. He found the work which was most congenial to=
 him. He pursued it with admirable industry and with brilliant success, and=
 he left behind him a book which is not likely to be forgotten while the En=
glish language endures.</p>

, the nature and limits of my general plan.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_414">The memorable series of revolutions, which, in=
 the course of about thirteen centuries, gradually undermined, and at lengt=
h destroyed, the solid fabric of human greatness, may, with some propriety,=
 be divided into the three following periods:</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_415">I. The first of these periods may be traced fr=
om the age of Trajan and the Antonines, when the Roman monarchy, having att=
ained its full strength and maturity, began to verge towards its decline; a=
nd will extend to the subversion of the Western Empire, by the barbarians o=
f Germany and Scythia, the rude ancestors of the most polished nations of m=
odern Europe. This extraordinary revolution, which subjected Rome to the po=
wer of a Gothic conqueror, was completed about the beginning of the sixth c=
entury.</p>
<span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </spa=
n><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>xxx<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span=
>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_416">II. The second period of the Decline and Fall =
of Rome may be supposed to commence with the reign of Justinian, who by his=
 laws, as well as by his victories, restored a transient splendour to the E=
astern Empire. It will comprehend the invasion of Italy by the Lombards; th=
e conquest of the Asiatic and African provinces by the Arabs, who embraced =
the religion of Mahomet; the revolt of the Roman people against the feeble =
princes of Constantinople; and the elevation of Charlemagne, who, in the ye=
ar 800, established the second, or German Empire of the West.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_417">III. The last and longest of these periods inc=
ludes about six centuries and a half; from the revival of the Western Empir=
e till the taking of Constantinople by the Turks and the extinction of a de=
generate race of princes, who continued to assume the titles of C=C3=A6sar =
and Augustus, after their dominions were contracted to the limits of a sing=
le city; in which the language, as well as manners, of the ancient Romans h=
ad been long since forgotten. The writer who should undertake to relate the=
 events of this period would find himself obliged to enter into the general=
 history of the Crusades, as far as they contributed to the ruin of the Gre=
ek Empire; and he would scarcely be able to restrain his curiosity from mak=
ing some enquiry into the state of the city of Rome during the darkness and=
 confusion of the middle ages.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_418">As I have ventured, perhaps too hastily, to co=
mmit to the press a work, which, in every sense of the word, deserves the e=
pithet of imperfect, I consider myself as contracting an engagement to fini=

ius Spartianus, Julius Capitolinus, =C3=86lius Lampridius, Vulcatius Gallic=
anus, Trebellius Pollio, and Flavius Vopiscus. But there is so much perplex=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_424"><span class=3D"csc">I now</span> discharge my =
promise, and complete my design, of writing the History of the Decline and =
Fall of the Roman Empire, both in the West and the East. The whole period e=
xtends from the age of Trajan and the Antonines to the taking of Constantin=
ople by Mahomet the Second; and includes a review of the Crusades and the s=
tate of Rome during the middle ages. Since the publication of the first vol=
ume, twelve years have elapsed; twelve years, according to my wish, =E2=80=
=9Cof health, of leisure and of perseverance.=E2=80=9D I may now congratula=
te my deliverance from a long and laborious service, and my satisfaction wi=
ll be pure and perfect, if the public favour should be extended to the conc=
lusion of my work.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_425">It was my first intention to have collected un=
der one view the numerous authors, of every age and language, from whom I h=
ave derived the materials of this history; and I am still convinced that th=
e apparent ostentation would be more than compensated by real use. If I hav=
e renounced this idea, if I have declined an undertaking which had obtained=
 the approbation of a master-artist,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/=

otnote-link type-footnote">1</a> my excuse may be found in the extreme diff=
iculty of assigning a proper measure to such a catalogue. A naked list of n=
ames and editions would not be satisfactory either to myself or my readers:=
 the characters of the principal Authors of the Roman and Byzantine History=
 have been occasionally connected with the events which they describe; a mo=
re copious and critical enquiry might indeed deserve, but it would demand, =
an elaborate volume, which <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Ed=
ition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>xxxvi<span cla=
ss=3D"bracket">]</span></span> might swell by degrees into a general librar=
y of historical writers. For the present I shall content myself with renewi=
ng my serious protestation, that I have always endeavoured to draw from the=
 fountain-head; that my curiosity, as well as a sense of duty, has always u=
rged me to study the originals; and that, if they have sometimes eluded my =
search, I have carefully marked the secondary evidence, on whose faith a pa=
ssage or a fact were reduced to depend.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_426">I shall soon visit the banks of the lake of La=
usanne, a country which I have known and loved from my early youth. Under a=
 mild government, amidst a beauteous landskip, in a life of leisure and ind=
ependence, and among a people of easy and elegant manners, I have enjoyed, =
and may again hope to enjoy, the varied pleasures of retirement and society=
. But I shall ever glory in the name and character of an Englishman: I am p=
roud of my birth in a free and enlightened country; and the approbation of =
that country is the best and most honourable reward for my labours. Were I =
ambitious of any other Patron than the Public, I would inscribe this work t=
o a Statesman, who, in a long, a stormy, and at length an unfortunate admin=
istration, had many political opponents, almost without a personal enemy: w=
ho has retained, in his fall from power, many faithful and disinterested fr=
iends; and who, under the pressure of severe infirmity, enjoys the lively v=
igour of his mind, and the felicity of his incomparable temper. <span class=
=3D"csc">Lord North</span> will permit me to express the feelings of friend=
ship in the language of truth: but even truth and friendship should be sile=
nt, if he still dispensed the favours of the crown.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_427">In a remote solitude, vanity may still whisper=
 in my ear that my readers, perhaps, may enquire whether, in the conclusion=
 of the present work, I am now taking an everlasting farewell. They shall h=
ear all that I know myself, all that I could reveal to the most intimate fr=
iend. The motives of action or silence are now equally balanced; nor can I =
pronounce, in my most secret thoughts, on which side the scale will prepond=
erate. I cannot dissemble that twelve ample <span class=3D"pb"><span class=
=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</s=
pan>xxxvii<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> octavos must have tried, =
and may have exhausted, the indulgence of the Public; that, in the repetiti=
on of similar attempts, a successful Author has much more to lose, than he =
can hope to gain; that I am now descending into the vale of years; and that=
 the most respectable of my countrymen, the men whom I aspire to imitate, h=
ave resigned the pen of history about the same period of their lives. Yet I=
 consider that the annals of ancient and modern times may afford many rich =
and interesting subjects; that I am still possessed of health and leisure; =
that by the practice of writing some skill and facility must be acquired; a=
nd that in the ardent pursuit of truth and knowledge I am not conscious of =
decay. To an active mind, indolence is more painful than labour; and the fi=
rst months of my liberty will be occupied and amused in the excursions of c=
uriosity and taste. By such temptations I have been sometimes seduced from =
the rigid duty even of a pleasing and voluntary task: but my time will now =
be my own; and in the use or abuse of independence I shall no longer fear m=
y own reproaches or those of my friends. I am fairly entitled to a year of =
jubilee: next summer and the following winter will rapidly pass away; and e=
xperience only can determine whether I shall still prefer the freedom and v=
ariety of study to the design and composition of a regular work, which anim=
ates, while it confines, the daily application of the Author. Caprice and a=
ccident may influence my choice; but the dexterity of self-love will contri=
ve to applaud either active industry or philosophic repose.</p>

=E2=80=94 I shall embrace this opportunity of introducing two <i>verbal</i>=
 remarks, which have not conveniently offered themselves to my notice. 1. A=
s often as I use the definitions of <i>beyond</i> the Alps, the Rhine, the =
Danube, &amp;c., I generally suppose myself at Rome, and afterwards at Cons=
tantinople: without observing whether this relative geography may agree wit=
h the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page:=
 </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>xxxviii<span class=3D"bracket">]</s=
pan></span> local, but variable, situation of the reader or the historian. =
2. In proper names of foreign, and especially of Oriental, origin, it shoul=
d be always our aim to express in our English version a faithful copy of th=
e original. But this rule, which is founded on a just regard to uniformity =
and truth, must often be relaxed; and the exceptions will be limited or enl=
arged by the custom of the language and the taste of the interpreter. Our a=
lphabets may be often defective: a harsh sound, an uncouth spelling, might =
offend the ear or the eye of our countrymen; and some words, notoriously co=
rrupt, are fixed, and, as it were, naturalised in the vulgar tongue. The pr=
ophet <i>Mohammed</i> can no longer be stripped of the famous, though impro=
per, appellation of Mahomet: the well-known cities of Aleppo, Damascus and =
Cairo would almost be lost in the strange descriptions of <i>Haleb, Demashk=
</i> and <i>Al Cahira:</i> the titles and offices of the Ottoman empire are=
 fashioned by the practice of three hundred years; and we are pleased to bl=
end the three Chinese monosyllables <i>Con-f=C3=BB-tzee</i> in the respecta=
ble name of Confucius, or even to adopt the Portuguese corruption of Mandar=
in. But I would vary the use of Zoroaster and <i>Zerdusht,</i> as I drew my=
 information from Greece or Persia: since our connection with India, the ge=
nuine <i>Timour</i> is restored to the throne of Tamerlane: our most correc=
t writers have retrenched the <i>Al,</i> the superfluous article, from the =
Koran; and we escape an ambiguous termination by adopting <i>Moslem</i> ins=
tead of Musulman, in the plural number. In these, and in a thousand example=
s, the shades of distinction are often minute; and I can feel, where I cann=
ot explain, the motives of my choice.</p>

<p class=3D"indent-center" id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_429"><span class=3D"sc">by =
the editor</span></p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_430"><span class=3D"csc">Gibbon</span> is one of th=
ose few writers who hold as high a place in the history of literature as in=
 the roll of great historians. He concerns us here as an historian; our bus=
iness is to consider how far the view which he has presented of the decline=
 and fall of the Roman Empire can be accepted as faithful to the facts, and=
 in what respects it needs correction in the light of discoveries which hav=
e been made since he wrote. But the fact that his work, composed more than =
a hundred years ago, is still successful with the general circle of educate=
d people, and has not gone the way of Hume and Robertson, whom we laud as =
=E2=80=9Cclassics=E2=80=9D and leave on the cold shelves, is due to the sin=
gularly happy union of the historian and the man of letters. Gibbon thus ra=
nks with Thucydides and Tacitus, and is perhaps the clearest example that b=
rilliance of style and accuracy of statement =E2=80=94 in Livy=E2=80=99s ca=
se conspicuously divorced =E2=80=94 are perfectly compatible in an historia=
n.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_431">His position among men of letters depends both=
 on the fact that he was an exponent of important ideas and on his style. T=
he appreciation of his style devolves upon the history of literature; but i=
t may be interesting to illustrate how much attention he paid to it, by alt=
erations which he made in his text. The first volume was published, in quar=
to form, in 1776, and the second quarto edition of this volume, which appea=
red in 1782, exhibits a considerable number of variants. Having carefully c=
ollated the two editions throughout the first fourteen chapters, I have obs=
erved that, in most <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: =
current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>xl<span class=3D"brac=
ket">]</span></span> cases, the changes were made for the sake not of corre=
cting misstatements of fact, but of improving the turn of a sentence, rearr=
anging the dactyls and cretics, or securing greater accuracy of expression.=
 Some instances may be interesting.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_447">But Gibbon has his place in literature not onl=
y as the stylist, who never lays aside his toga when he takes up his pen, b=
ut as the expounder of a large and striking idea in a sphere of intense int=
erest to mankind, and as a powerful representative of certain tendencies of=
 his age. The guiding idea or =E2=80=9Cmoral=E2=80=9D of his history is bri=
efly stated in his epigram: =E2=80=9CI have described the triumph of barbar=
ism and religion.=E2=80=9D In other words, the historical development of <s=

 human societies, since the second century after Christ, was a retrogressio=
n (according to ordinary views of =E2=80=9Cprogress=E2=80=9D), for which Ch=
ristianity was mainly to blame. This conclusion of Gibbon tended in the sam=
e direction as the theories of Rousseau; only, while Rousseau dated the dec=
line from the day when men left Arcadia, Gibbon=E2=80=99s era was the death=
 of Marcus Aurelius.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_448">We are thus taken into a region of speculation=
 where every traveller must make his own chart. But to attempt to deny a ge=
neral truth in Gibbon=E2=80=99s point of view is vain; and it is feeble to =
deprecate his sneer. We may spare more sympathy than he for the warriors an=
d the churchmen; but all that has since been added to his knowledge of fact=
s has neither reversed nor blunted the point of the =E2=80=9CDecline and Fa=
ll.=E2=80=9D Optimism of temperament may shut the eyes; faith, wedded to so=
me =E2=80=9Cone increasing purpose=E2=80=9D which it shrinks from grasping,=
 may divert from the path of facts. But for an inquirer not blinded by reli=
gious prepossessions, or misled by comfortable sophistries, Gibbon really e=
xpounded one of the chief data with which the philosophy of history has to =
reckon. How are we to define progress? how recognise retrogression? What is=
 the end in relation to which such words have their meaning, and is there a=
 law which will explain =E2=80=9Cthe triumph of barbarism and religion=E2=
=80=9D as a necessary moment in a reasonable process towards that end, what=
ever it may be? Answers have been given since Gibbon=E2=80=99s day, engagin=
g to the intellect, but always making some demand on the faith =E2=80=94 an=
swers for which he would have the same smile as for Leo=E2=80=99s Dogmatic =
Epistle. There is certainly some reason for thinking these questions insolu=
ble. We may say at least that the meaning of the philosophy of history is m=
isapprehended until it is recognised that its function is not to solve prob=
lems but to transform them.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_449">But, though the moral of Gibbon=E2=80=99s work=
 has not lost its meaning yet, it is otherwise with the particular treatmen=
t of Christian theology and Christian institutions. Our point <span class=
=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span cla=
ss=3D"bracket">[</span>xlvii<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> of view=
 has altered, and, if Gibbon were writing now, the tone of his =E2=80=9Ccan=
did and rational inquiry=E2=80=9D would certainly be different. His manner =
would not be that of sometimes open, sometimes transparently veiled, dislik=
e; he would rather assume an attitude of detachment. He would be affected b=
y that merely historical point of view, which is a note of the present cent=
ury and its larger tolerances; and more than half disarmed by that wide dif=
fusion of unobtrusive scepticism among educated people, which seems to rend=
er offensive warfare superfluous. The man of letters admires the fine edge =
of subtle sarcasm, wielded by Gibbon with such skill and effect; while the =
historian is interested in an historical standpoint of the last century. Ne=
ither the historian nor the man of letters will any longer subscribe, witho=
ut a thousand reserves, to the theological chapters of the =E2=80=9CDecline=
 and Fall,=E2=80=9D and no discreet inquirer would go there for his ecclesi=
astical history. Yet we need not hide the fact that Gibbon=E2=80=99s succes=
s has in a large measure been due to his scorn for the Church; which, most =
emphatically expressed in the theological chapters, has, as one might say, =
spiced his book. The attack of a man, equipped with erudition, and of perfe=
ctly sober judgment, on cherished beliefs and revered institutions, must al=
ways excite the interest, by irritating the passions, of men. Gibbon=E2=80=
=99s classical moderation of judgment, his temperate mood, was responsible,=
 as well as foreign education and the influence of French thought, for his =
attitude to Christianity and to Mahometanism. He hated excess, and the immo=
deration of the multitude. He could suffer the tolerant piety of a learned =
abb=C3=A9 or =E2=80=9Cthe fat slumbers of the Church=E2=80=9D; but with the=
 religious faith of a fanatical populace or the ardour of its demagogues hi=
s reason was unable to sympathise. In the spirit of Cicero or Tacitus he de=
spised the superstitions of the vulgar, and regarded the unmeasured enthusi=
asm of the early Christians as many sober Churchmen regard the fanaticism o=
f Islam. He dealt out the same measure to the <span class=3D"pb"><span clas=

 =E2=80=9Cthere is no room for sweeping denunciations or trenchant criticis=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_450">Thus Gibbon=E2=80=99s attitude to religion, wh=

g, but in an historical critic are merely an impertinence.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_451">It has sometimes been remarked that those hist=
ories are most readable which are written to prove a thesis. The indictment=
 of the Empire by Tacitus, the defence of C=C3=A6sarianism by Mommsen, Grot=
e=E2=80=99s vindication of democracy, Droysen=E2=80=99s advocacy of monarch=
y, might be cited as examples. All these writers intended to present the fa=
cts as they took place, but all wrote with prepossessions and opinions, in =
the light of which they interpreted the events of history. Arnold deliberat=
ely advocated such partiality on the ground that =E2=80=9Cthe past is refle=
cted to us by the present and the partyman feels the present most.=E2=80=9D=
 Another Oxford Regius Professor remarked that =E2=80=9Cwithout some infusi=

n: =E2=80=9CIch will bloss sagen wie es eigentlich gewesen ist.=E2=80=9D Th=
e Greek History of Bishop Thirlwall, the English Constitutional History of =
Bishop Stubbs himself, were written in this spirit. But the most striking i=
nstances perhaps, because they tread with such light feet on the treacherou=
s ashes of more recent history, are Ranke and Bishop Creighton. Thucydides =
is the most ancient example of this historical reserve. It cannot be said t=
hat Gibbon sat down to write with any ulterior purpose, but, as we have see=
n, he allowed his temperament to colour his history, and used it to prove a=
 congenial thesis. But, while he put things in the light demanded by this t=
hesis, he related his facts accurately. If we take into account the vast ra=
nge of his work, his accuracy is amazing. He laboured under some disadvanta=
ges, which are set forth in his own Memoirs. He had not enjoyed that school=
 and university training in the languages and literatures of Greece and Rom=
e which is probably the best preparation for historical research. His knowl=
edge of Greek was imperfect; he was very far from having the =E2=80=9Cscrup=
ulous ear of the well-flogged critic.=E2=80=9D He has committed errors of t=
ranslation, and was capable of writing =E2=80=9CGregory of Nazianzen.=E2=80=
=9D But such slips are singularly few. Nor is he accustomed to take lightly=
 quotations at second hand; like that famous passage of Eligius of Noyon =
=E2=80=94 held up by Arnold as a warning =E2=80=94 which Robertson and Hall=
am successively copied from Mosheim, where it had appeared in a garbled for=
m, to prove exactly the opposite of its true meaning.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_452">From one curious inaccuracy, which neither cri=
tics nor editors seem to have observed, he must I think be acquitted. In hi=

though he is well sustained through the wars of Justinian by the clear narr=
ative of Procopius.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_460">Recognising that Gibbon was accurate, we do no=

merous scholars, in the course of a hundred years, have not only added to o=
ur knowledge of facts, but have modified and upset conclusions which Gibbon=
 with his materials was justified in drawing. Compare a chapter or two of M=
r. Hodgkin=E2=80=99s <i>Italy and her Invaders</i> with the corresponding e=
pisode in Gibbon, and many minor points will appear in which correction has=
 been needful. If Gibbon were alive and writing now, his history would be v=
ery different. Affected by the intellectual experiences of the past century=
 he could not adopt quite the same historical attitude; and we should conse=
quently lose the colouring of his brilliant attack on Christianity. <span c=

ter. We dare not deplore Gibbon=E2=80=99s limitations, for they were the co=
nditions of his great achievement.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_461">Not the least important aspect of the Decline =
and Fall is its lesson in the unity of history, the favourite theme of Mr. =
Freeman. The title displays the cardinal fact that the Empire founded by Au=
gustus fell in 1461; that all the changes which transformed the Europe of M=
arcus Aurelius into the Europe of Erasmus had not abolished the name and me=
mory of the Empire. And whatever names of contempt =E2=80=94 in harmony wit=
h his thesis =E2=80=94 Gibbon might apply to the institution in the period =
of its later decline, such as the =E2=80=9CLower Empire,=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=
=9CGreek Empire,=E2=80=9D his title rectified any false impressions that su=
ch language might cause. On the continuity of the Roman Empire depended the=
 unity of his work. By the emphasis laid on this fact he did the same kind =
of service to the study of history in England, that Mr. Bryce has done in h=
is <i>Holy Roman Empire</i> by tracing the thread which connects the Europe=
 of Francis the Second with the Europe of Charles the Great.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_462">Gibbon read widely, and had a large general kn=
owledge of history, which supplied him with many happy illustrations. It is=
 worth pointing out that the gap in his knowledge of ancient history was th=
e period of the Diadochi and Epigoni. If he had been familiar with that per=
iod, he would not have said that Diocletian was the first to give to the wo=
rld the example of a resignation of sovereignty. He would have referred to =
the conspicuous case of Ptolemy Soter; Mr. Freeman would have added Lydiada=
s, the tyrant of Megalopolis. Of the earlier example of Asarhaddon Gibbon c=
ould not have known.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_463">To pass from scope and spirit to method, Gibbo=
n=E2=80=99s historical sense kept him constantly right in dealing with his =
<span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </spa=
n><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>liii<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></spa=
n> sources, but he can hardly be said to have treated them methodically. Th=
e growth of German erudition is one of the leading features of the intellec=
tual history of the nineteenth century; and one of its most important contr=
ibutions to historical method lies in the investigation of sources. German =
scholars have indeed pressed this =E2=80=9CQuellenkunde=E2=80=9D further th=
an it can safely be pressed. A philologist, writing his doctoral dissertati=
on, will bring plausible reasons to prove where exactly Diodorus ceased to =
=E2=80=9Cwrite out=E2=80=9D Ephorus, whose work we do not possess, and bega=
n to write out somebody else, whose work is also lost to us. But, though th=
e method lends itself to the multiplication of vain subtleties, it is absol=
utely indispensable for scientific historiography. It is in fact part of th=
e science of evidence. The distinction of primary and derivative authoritie=
s might be used as a test. The untrained historian fails to recognise that =
nothing is added to the value of a statement of Widukind by its repetition =
by Thietmar or Ekkehard, and that a record in the Continuation of Theophane=
s gains no further credibility from the fact that it likewise occurs in Ced=
renus, Zonaras or Glycas.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_464">While evidence is more systematically arranged=
, greater care is bestowed on sifting and probing what our authorities say,=
 and in distinguishing contemporary from later witnesses. Not a few importa=

ius will not be necessarily applicable to the age of the sons and grandsons=
 of Chlodwig, and a custom which was familiar to Gregory or Venantius may h=

 to compare Gibbon=E2=80=99s description of the social and political instit=

hom a century had elapsed, and composes a single picture; whereas Bishop St=
ubbs keeps the statements of the two Romans carefully apart, and by compari=
ng them is able to show that in certain respects the Germans had developed =
in the interval. Gibbon=E2=80=99s account of the military establishment of =
the Empire, in the first chapter of his work, is open to a like objection. =
He has blended, without due criticism, the evidence of Vegetius with that o=

 of the Gordians is still as great a puzzle as ever; but the dates of Alexa=

of which Gibbon was ignorant. While speaking of the third century, I may ad=
d that Calpurnius Siculus, whom Gibbon claimed as a contemporary of Carinus=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_473">The constitutional history of the Empire from =

acute legal ability has elaborated the study of the science in the present =
century; I need only refer to such names as Savigny and Jhering. A critical=
 edition of the Corpus juris Romani by Mommsen himself has been one of the =
chief contributions. The manuscript of Gaius is the new discovery to be rec=
orded; and we can imagine with what interest Gibbon, were he restored to ea=

over the ground in Germany, and Gfr=C3=B6rer, whose ecclesiastical studies =
had taken him into those regions, had written a good deal of various value.=
 Hirsch=E2=80=99s <i>Byzantinische Studien</i> had just appeared, and Ramba=

 Was Procopius the author? and in any case, are the statements credible? Gi=

st of Sophonius Tigellinus; and he did not hesitate to believe them. Their =
credibility is now generally questioned, but the historian of C=C3=A6sarea =
is a much more interesting figure if it can be shown that he was the author=
. From a careful comparison of the Secret History with the works of Procopi=
an authorship, in point of style, Dahn concluded that Procopius wrote it. R=
anke argued against this view and maintained that it was the work of a malc=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_485">Procopius was a malcontent who hated Justinian=
 and all his works. He set himself the task of writing a history of his tim=
e, which, as the secretary of Belisarius, he had good opportunities of obse=
rving. He composed a narrative of the military events, in which he abstaine=
d from committing himself, so that it could be safely published in his own =
lifetime. Even here his critical attitude to the government is sometimes cl=
ear. He allows it to be read between the lines that he regarded the reconqu=
est of Africa and Italy as calamities for those countries; which thus came =
under an <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Pa=

an></span> oppressor, to be stripped by his governors and tax gatherers. Bu=
t the domestic administration was more dangerous ground, on which Procopius=
 could not tread without raising a voice of bitter indignation and hatred. =
So he dealt with this in a book which was to be kept secret during his own =
life and bequeathed to friends who might be trusted to give it to the world=
 at a suitable time. The greater part of the Military History, which treate=
d in seven Books the Persian, Vandalic, and Gothic wars, was finished in 54=
5 <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span>,</span> and perhap=

the plan of making adulation so fulsome, that, except to Justinian=E2=80=99=
s vanity, he might appear to be laughing in his sleeve. At the very beginni=
ng of the treatise he has a sly allusion to the explosives which were lying=
 in his desk, unknown to the Imperial spies.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_486">Such is the outline of the literary motives of=
 Procopius as we must conceive them, now that we have a practical certainty=
 that he, and no other, wrote the Secret History. For Haury=E2=80=99s <span=
 class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><sp=
an class=3D"bracket">[</span>lxvi<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> da=
tes enable us, as he points out, to argue as follows: If Procopius did not =
write the book, it was obviously written by a forger, who wished it to pass=
 as a Procopian work. But in 550 no forger could have had the close acquain=
tance with the Military History which is exhibited by the author of the Ane=
cdota. And moreover the identity of the introduction of the eighth Book of =
the Military History with that of the Secret History, which was urged by Ra=
nke as an objection to the genuineness of the latter work, now tells decisi=
vely in favour of it. For if Procopius composed it in 553, how could a forg=
er, writing in 550, have anticipated it? And if the forger composed it in 5=
50, how are we to explain its appearance in a later work of Procopius himse=
lf? These considerations put it beyond all reasonable doubt that Procopius =
was the author of the Secret History; for this assumption is the only one w=
hich supplies an intelligible explanation of the facts.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_487">Another puzzle in connection with Justinian la=
y in certain biographical details relating to that emperor and his family; =
which Alemanni, in his commentary on the Secret History, quoted on the auth=
ority of a Life of Justinian by a certain Abbot Theophilus, said to have be=
en the Emperor=E2=80=99s preceptor. Of these biographical notices, and of J=
ustinian=E2=80=99s preceptor Theophilus, we otherwise knew nothing; nor had=
 any one, since Alemanni, seen the Biography. Gibbon and other historians a=
ccepted without question the statements quoted by Alemanni; though it would=
 have been wiser to treat them with more reserve, until some data for criti=
cising them were discovered. The puzzle of Alemanni=E2=80=99s source, the L=
ife of Theophilus, was solved by Mr. Bryce, who discovered in the library o=
f the Barberini palace at Rome the original text from which Alemanni drew h=
is information.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/gibbon-the-hist=

ning the Life of Justinian up to the thirtieth year of his reign, composed =
by Bogomil, abbot of the monastery of St. Alexander in Dardania. This extra=
ct was translated by Marnavich, Canon of Sebenico (afterwards Bishop of Bos=
nia, 1631-1639), a friend of Alemanni, and some notes were appended by the =
same scholar. <i>Bogomil</i> is the Slavonic equivalent of the Greek <i>The=
ophilus,</i> which was accordingly adopted by Alemanni in his references. M=
r. Bryce has shown clearly that this document, interesting as it is in illu=
strating how Slavonic legends had grown up round the name of Justinian, is =
worthless as history, and that there is no reason to suppose that such a pe=
rson as the Dardanian Bogomil ever existed. We are indeed met by a new prob=
lem, which, however, is of no serious concern to the practical purposes of =
history. How did Marnavich obtain a copy of the original Life, from which h=
e made the extract, and which he declares to be preserved in the library of=
 the monks who profess the rule of St. Basil on Mount Athos? Does the origi=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_493">As I have already observed, it is perhaps on t=
he Slavonic side of the history of the Empire that Gibbon is most conspicuo=
usly inadequate. Since he wrote, various causes have combined to increase o=
ur knowledge of Slavonic antiquity. The Slavs themselves have engaged in me=
thodical investigation of their own past; and, since the entire or partial =
emancipations of the southern Slavs from Asiatic rule, a general interest i=
n Slavonic things has grown up throughout Europe. Gibbon dismissed the hist=
ory of the First Bulgarian Kingdom, from its foundation in the reign of Con=
stantine Pogonatus to its overthrow by the second Basil, in two pages. To-d=
ay the author of a history of the Empire on the same scale would find two h=
undred a strict limit. Gibbon tells us nothing of the Slavonic missionaries=
, Cyril and Methodius, round whose names an extensive literature has been f=
ormed. It is only in recent years that the geography of the Illyrian penins=
ula has become an accessible subject of study.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_494">The investigation of the history of the northe=
rn peoples who came under the influence of the Empire has been stimulated b=
y controversy, and controversy has been animated and even embittered by nat=

 would mean the usurpation of at least a volume by the editor. What more ha=

ented the union of the provinces. Their peaceful inhabitants enjoyed and ab=
used the advantages of wealth and luxury. The image of a free constitution =
was preserved with decent reverence. The Roman senate appeared to possess t=

rs of government. During a happy period of more than fourscore years, the p=
ublic administration was conducted by the virtue and abilities of Nerva, Tr=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_519">Such were the arts of war, by which the Roman =
emperors defended their extensive conquests, and preserved a military spiri=
t, at a time when every other virtue was oppressed by luxury and despotism.=
 If, in the consideration of their armies, we pass from their discipline to=
 their numbers, we shall not find it easy to define them with any tolerable=
 accuracy. We may compute, however, that the legion, which was itself a bod=
y of six thousand eight hundred and thirty-one Romans, might, with its atte=
ndant auxiliaries, amount to about twelve thousand five hundred men. The pe=
ace establishment of Hadrian and his successors was composed of no less tha=
n thirty of these formidable brigades; and most probably formed a standing =
force of three hundred and seventy-five thousand men. Instead of being conf=
ined within the walls of fortified cities, which the Romans considered as t=
he refuge of weakness or pusillanimity, the legions were encamped on the ba=
nks of the great rivers, and along the frontiers of the barbarians. As thei=
r stations, for the most part, remained fixed and permanent, we may venture=
 to describe the distribution of the troops. Three legions were sufficient =
for Britain. The principal strength lay upon the Rhine and Danube, and cons=
isted of sixteen legions, in the following proportions: two in the Lower, a=
nd three in the Upper Germany; one in Rh=C3=A6tia, one in Noricum, four in =
Pannonia, three in M=C3=A6sia, and two in Dacia. The defence <span class=3D=

 the other two in Cappadocia. With regard to Egypt, Africa, and Spain, as t=
hey were far removed from any important scene of war, a single legion maint=
ained the domestic tranquillity of each of those great provinces. Even Ital=
y was not left destitute of a military force. Above twenty thousand chosen =
soldiers, distinguished by the titles of City Cohorts and Pr=C3=A6torian Gu=
ards, watched over the safety of the monarch and the capital. As the author=

ourishing district westward of Mount Taurus and the river Halys, was dignif=

, the maritime countries of the Pamphylians, Lycians, and Carians, and the =
Grecian colonies of Ionia, which equalled in arts, though not in arms, the =
glory of their parent. The kingdoms of Bithynia and Pontus possessed the no=

the inland country, separated from the Roman Asia by the river Halys, and f=

very refinement of conveniency, of elegance, and of splendour, whatever cou=

erfluities, of life. But in the present imperfect condition of society, lux=

, and the skilful artist, who have obtained no share in the division of the=
 earth, receive a voluntary tax from the possessors of land; and the latter=
 are prompted, by a sense of interest, to improve those estates, with whose=
 produce they may purchase additional pleasures. This operation, the partic=

 them by the arms and authority of Rome. As long as the circulation was con=

 from the death of Domitian to the accession of Commodus. The vast extent o=

rtue and wisdom. The armies were restrained by the firm but gentle hand of =
four successive emperors, whose characters and authority commanded involunt=

republic, had the Romans of their days been capable of enjoying a rational =
freedom.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_603">The labours of these monarchs were over-paid b=

bittered, however, the noblest of human enjoyments. They must often have re=
collected the instability of a happiness which depended on the character of=
 a single man. The fatal moment was perhaps approaching, when some licentio=
us youth, or some jealous tyrant, would abuse, to the destruction, that abs=
olute power which they had exerted for the benefit of their people. The ide=
al restraints of the senate and the laws might serve to display the virtues=
, but could never correct the vices, of the emperor. The military force was=
 a blind and irresistible instrument of oppression; and the corruption of R=

 prepared to serve, the fear or the avarice, the lust or the cruelty, of th=

 the multitude. In the tumult of civil discord the laws of society lose the=
ir force, and their place is seldom supplied by those of humanity. The ardo=

volved the detail of the public business on Perennis; a servile and ambitio=

t who possessed a considerable share of vigour and ability. By acts of exto=

pable of aspiring to it, had he not been prevented, surprised, and put to d=
eath. The fall of a minister is a very trifling incident in the general his=
tory of the empire; but it was hastened by an extraordinary circumstance, w=
hich proved how much the nerves of discipline were already relaxed. The leg=
ions of Britain, discontented with the administration of Perennis, formed a=
 deputation of fifteen hundred select men, with instructions to march to Ro=
me and lay their complaints before the emperor. These military petitioners,=
 by their own determined behaviour, by inflaming the divisions of the guard=

The intervals of lust were filled up with the basest amusements. The influe=
nce of a polite age and the labour of an attentive education had never been=
 able to infuse into his rude and brutish mind the least tincture of learni=
ng; and he was the first of the Roman emperors totally devoid of taste for =
the pleasures of the understanding. Nero himself excelled, or affected to e=
xcel, in the elegant arts of music and poetry; nor should we despise his pu=
rsuits, had he not converted the pleasing relaxation of a leisure hour into=
 the serious business and ambition of his life. But Commodus, from his earl=
iest infancy, discovered an aversion to whatever was rational or liberal, a=
nd a fond attachment to the amusements of the populace, =E2=80=94 the sport=
s of the circus and amphitheatre, the combats of gladiators, and the huntin=
g of wild beasts. The masters in every branch of learning, whom Marcus prov=
ided for his son, were heard with inattention and disgust; whilst the Moors=
 and Parthians, who taught him to dart the javelin and to shoot with the bo=

 released from prison, and restored to the full possession of their honours=

 Commodus endeavoured to extend itself beyond death) were deposited in the =

 the quarrel; and as military spirit and party zeal were strongly diffused =
throughout the whole community, a vanquished chief was immediately supplied=
 with new adherents, eager to shed their blood in the same cause. But the R=

ers. Under the standard of a popular candidate for empire, a few enlisted f=

 legions, uninflamed by party zeal, were allured into civil war by liberal =

t of pleasure, a regard for decency, and a respect for the public opinion, =

In a hasty sally of passion, Elagabalus resolved to execute by force what h=

his cousin from the rank and honours of C=C3=A6sar. The message was receive=

 guards swore to protect Alexander, and to revenge the dishonoured majesty =
of the throne. The tears and promises of the trembling Elagabalus, who only=
 begged them to spare his life, and to leave him in the possession of his b=

taxes invented by Caracalla and his pretended son, flourished in peace and =
prosperity under the administration of magistrates who were convinced by ex=
perience that to deserve the love of the subjects was their best and only m=
ethod of obtaining the favour of their sovereign. While some gentle restrai=
nts were imposed on the innocent luxury of the Roman people, the price of p=
rovisions and the interest of money were reduced by the paternal care of Al=
exander, whose prudent liberality, without distressing the industrious, sup=
plied the wants and amusements of the populace. The dignity, the freedom, t=

approach the person of the emperor without a fear and without a blush.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_713">The name of Antoninus, ennobled by the virtues=

laboured to restore the glories and felicity of the age of the genuine Anto=

 the emperor affected to display his love, and to conceal his fear, of the =

pplied a fund of gold and silver for the ordinary pay and the extraordinary=
 rewards of the troops. In their marches he relaxed the severe obligation o=
f carrying seventeen days=E2=80=99 provision on their shoulders. Ample maga=
zines were formed along the public roads, and as soon as they entered the e=
nemy=E2=80=99s country, a numerous train of mules and camels waited on thei=
r haughty laziness. As Alexander despaired of correcting the luxury of his =
soldiers, he attempted, at least, to direct it to objects of martial pomp a=

 and gold. He shared whatever fatigues he was obliged to impose, visited, i=

nguishes the hopes of faction, and the conscious security disarms the cruel=
ty of the monarch. To the firm establishment of this idea we owe the peacef=
ul succession and mild administration of European monarchies. To the defect=
 of it we must attribute the frequent civil wars, through which an Asiatic =
despot is obliged to cut his way to the throne of his fathers. Yet, even in=
 the East, the sphere of contention is usually limited to the princes of th=
e reigning house, and, as soon as the more fortunate competitor has removed=
 his brethren, by the sword and the bow-string, he no longer entertains any=
 jealousy of his meaner subjects. But the Roman empire, after the authority=
 of the senate had sunk into contempt, was a vast scene of confusion. The r=
oyal, and even noble, families of the provinces had long since been led in =
triumph before the car of the haughty republicans. The ancient families of =
Rome had successively fallen beneath the tyranny of the C=C3=A6sars; and, w=
hilst those princes were shackled by the forms of a commonwealth, and disap=
pointed by the repeated failure of their posterity,<a href=3D"https://oll.l=

 to a rank in the army, in which a single crime would enable him to wrest t=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_738">About thirty-two years before that event, the =
emperor Severus, returning from an Eastern expedition, halted in Thrace, to=
 celebrate, with military games, the birthday of his younger son, Geta. The=
 country flocked in crowds to behold their sovereign, and a young barbarian=
 of gigantic stature earnestly solicited, in his rude dialect, that he migh=
t be allowed to contend for the prize of wrestling. As the pride of discipl=
ine would have been disgraced in the overthrow of a Roman soldier by a Thra=
cian peasant, he was matched with the stoutest followers of the camp, sixte=
en of whom he successively laid on the ground. His victory was rewarded by =
some trifling gifts, and a permission to enlist in the troops. The next day=
 the happy barbarian was distinguished above a crowd of recruits, dancing a=
nd exulting after the fashion of his country. As soon as he perceived that =
he had attracted the emperor=E2=80=99s notice, he instantly ran up to his h=
orse, and followed him on foot, without the least appearance of fatigue, in=
 a long and rapid career. =E2=80=9CThracian,=E2=80=9D said Severus, with as=

confounding them with those vices to which they bear the nearest affinity. =
The troops listened with pleasure to the emissaries of Maximin. They blushe=
d at their own ignominious patience, which, during thirteen years, had supp=
orted the vexatious discipline imposed by an effeminate Syrian, the timid s=
lave of his mother and of the senate. It was time, they cried, to cast away=
 that useless phantom of the civil power, and to elect for their prince and=
 general a real soldier, educated in camps, exercised in war, who would ass=
ert the glory and distribute among his companions the treasures of the empi=
re. A great army was at that time assembled on the banks of the Rhine, unde=
r the command of the emperor himself, who, almost immediately after his ret=
urn from the Persian war, had been obliged to march against the barbarians =
of Germany. The important care of training and reviewing the new levies was=
 entrusted to Maximin. One day, as he entered the field of exercise, the tr=

 to consummate their rebellion by the murder of Alexander Severus.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_741">The circumstances of his death are variously r=
elated. The writers who suppose that he died in ignorance of the ingratitud=

at least to conceal his approaching fate from the insults of the multitude.=
 He was soon followed by a tribune and some centurions, the ministers of de=

 exasperated by disappointments, which he imputed to the cowardice of his a=

ired hatred and a just desire of revenge. A party of Pr=C3=A6torian guards,=
 who trembled for their wives and children in the camp of Alba, near Rome, =
executed the sentence of the senate. Maximin, abandoned by his guards, was =

nation of soldiers, magistrates, and legislators, who composed the thirty-f=
ive tribes of the Roman people, was dissolved into the common mass of manki=

 men who preserved and abused their independence. By their tumultuary elect=

 the ambition, or relaxed by the weakness, of the emperors. The strength of=
 the frontiers, which had always consisted in arms rather than in fortifica=

 Their genius and character, as well as the reverence paid to that importan=

 is rather an amusement of the fancy than a passion of the soul. And yet, w=

e are insensibly seduced by the fiction, and feel a momentary glow of marti=
al ardour. But how faint, how cold is the sensation which a peaceful mind c=
an receive from solitary study! It was in the hour of battle, or in the fea=

s, the ancestors of those warlike chieftains who listened with transport to=
 their artless but animated strains. The view of arms and of danger heighte=

cite, the desire of fame and the contempt of death, were the habitual senti=

e dictator (post C=C3=A6sarem dictatorem; ii. 7, 5). He came down at least =
as far as Caracalla.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_831"><i>Vulcacius Gallicanus</i> likewise addressed=
 to Diocletian a work on the lives of all the Emperors who bore the full ti=
tle of Augustus, whether by legitimate right or as tyrants. See vi. 3, 3.</=
p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_832">The series of <i>Trebellius Pollio</i> was on =
a more limited scale. It began with the two Philips, and embracing all Empe=
rors, whether renowned or obscure, reached as far as Claudius and his broth=
er Quintillus. It was not dedicated to Diocletian but was written in his re=
ign, before Constantius Chlorus had been raised to the dignity of Augustus,=
 that is before 1st May 305 (cp. xxiii. 7, 1, where Claudius is described a=
s the ancestor <i>Constanti C=C3=A6saris nostri;</i> cp. too, <i>ib.</i> 14=
, 3, where <i>Constantinus</i> is an error for <i>Constantius,</i> and xxiv=
. 21, 7, where we get the prior limit of 302). It is probable that the work=
 of Pollio was a continuation of another series of Lives which ended with t=
he accession of Philip; and it is possible that this presumable series may =
have been actually that of Spartian or Vulcacius, but it is quite uncertain=
.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_833"><i>Flavius Vopiscus</i> of Syracuse professedl=
y continued the work of Pollio, and carried it down as far as the death of =
Carinus and accession of Diocletian. He wrote, at least, the life of Aureli=
an between 1st May 305 and 25th July 306, the period in which Constantius w=
as Emperor; et est quidem iam Constantius imperator, xxvi. 44, 5.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_834"><i>Julius Capitolinus</i> wrote another series=
 of Imperial biographies, of which some were composed under, and dedicated =
to, Diocletian, while others were written at a later period for Constantine=
. Where he began is uncertain; the earliest Life from his pen which we poss=
ess is that of Antoninus Pius, the latest those of Maximus and Balbinus. Of=
 the Lives which are extant under <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decorat=

n class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> his name, those of Marcus, Lucius Verus=
, and Macrinus contain the name of Diocletian. Those of Albinus and the Max=
imins have internal notes of their dedication to Constantine. As Albinus co=
mes chronologically between Verus and Macrinus, both dating from the reign =
of Diocletian, it is impossible, if the ascription of <i>Macrinus</i> to Ca=
pitolinus is right, to draw the conclusion that all the earlier Lives were =
written in the earlier period, and all the later Lives in the later. But to=
 this point I shall return.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_835"><i>=C3=86lius Lampridius</i> dedicated his Imp=
erial biographies to Constantine. He began with Commodus, if not earlier, a=
nd intended to include Diocletian and Maximian. The latest of his Lives tha=
t exists is that of Alexander Severus.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_836">The original MS. of the Historia Augusta, from=
 which our MSS. are derived, contained a complete series of Imperial biogra=
phies, from Hadrian to Carinus, put together from the works of these six wr=
iters. The work of Pollio, and its continuation by Vopiscus, were included =
in their entirety. The contributions drawn from the various biographers may=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_837">I. The Life of Geta (xiv.) I have not included=
 in this list. The name of the author is not given in the MSS.; the <i>edit=
io princeps</i> assigned it to Spartianus. There is, however, a serious obj=
ection against attributing it to Spartian in the lack of decisive external =
evidence. For it is dedicated to Constantine, whereas the Lives written by =
Spartian are dedicated to Diocletian. The fact that Spartian intended to wr=
ite a life of Geta (see xiii. 11, 1) proves nothing; for there is nothing t=
o show that separate Lives of Geta were not also included in the collection=
s of Lampridius and Capitolinus, and that the compiler of the Historia Augu=
sta did not prefer one of them to the <i>Geta</i> of Spartian.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_838">II. The Life of Opilius Macrinus (xv.) I have =
also omitted, although the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Ed=
ition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>308<span class=
=3D"bracket">]</span></span> MSS. ascribe it to Capitolinus. But it is high=
ly probable that the Inscriptio is not genuine. For the author of this Life=
 only knows of two Gordians (3, 5, nec inter Antoninos referendi sunt duo G=
ordiani), herein agreeing with Lampridius (xvi. 32, and xvii. 34, 6); where=
as Capitolinus is not only aware of the three Gordians, whose lives he wrot=
e (xx.), but criticises the ignorant writers who only speak of two (xx. 2, =
1, Gordiani non, ut quidam inperiti scriptores locuntur, duo sed tres fueru=
nt). This flagrant contradiction, which imperatively forbids us to ascribe =
the <i>Gordians</i> and <i>Macrinus</i> to the same writer, is borne out by=
 the fact that <i>Macrinus</i> is dedicated to Diocletian, whereas <i>Albin=
us</i> is addressed to Constantine. It is natural to suppose that Capitolin=
us wrote his Lives in chronological order, and completed in the reign of Co=
nstantine the biographical series which he had begun in that of Diocletian.=
 If we decide that our <i>Macrinus</i> is not really his work, we restore t=
he natural order. We cannot, however, suppose that <i>Macrinus</i> was the =
composition of Lampridius, who wrote under Constantine. We must attribute i=
t either to Spartian or to Vulcacius.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_839">III. The archetype of our MSS. was mutilated, =
and, unfortunately for the history of a very difficult period, there is a l=
acuna extending from the end of <i>Maximus</i> and <i>Balbinus</i> into the=
 <i>Two Valerians,</i> of which only a congeries of fragments remains. Thus=
 the Lives of Philip, Decius, and Gallus by Trebellius Pollio are lost. The=
 subscription at the end of <i>Maximus</i> and <i>Balbinus</i> attributes t=
he <i>Valerians</i> to Capitolinus, but this is clearly an insertion made a=
fter the lost Lives had fallen out.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_840">IV. In general the Lives are arranged in chron=
ological order. There are three remarkable deviations. (1) Didius Julianus =
comes after Verus and before Commodus, in the place where we should expect =
Avidius Cassius, while Avidius comes where we expect Julianus. (2) Albinus =
comes after Macrinus instead of following Pescennius; and (3) Heliogabalus,=
 Diadumenus, Macrinus takes the place of the proper order Macrinus, Diadume=
nus, Heliogabalus. In all three cases Peter has corrected the MSS. in his e=
dition. These misplacements cannot be explained by mistakes in the binding =
of the sheets (quaternions) of the archetype, though such mistakes certainl=
y occurred and led to minor misplacements, notably that in the Life of Alex=
ander, c. 43 (see Peter=E2=80=99s ed.).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_841">All these writers have much the same idea of h=
istorical biography. They give a great many personal details, and are fond =
of trivial anecdotes; but they have no notion of perspicuous arrangement, a=
nd no apprehension of deeper historical questions. Their chief source for t=
he earlier Lives was Marius Maximus (used by Spartian, Vulcacius, Capitolin=
us, and Lampridius, and criticised by Vopiscus as homo omnium verbosissimus=
, xxix. 1), who continued the work of Suetonius, from Nerva to Elagabalus. =
He lived about 170-230 <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</spa=
n></span> (See, for a daring attempt to reconstruct the history of Marius, =
M=C3=BCller=E2=80=99s essay in B=C3=BCdinger=E2=80=99s Untersuchungen zur r=
=C3=B6mischen Kaisergeschichte, vol. iii. The tract of J. Plew, Marius Maxi=
mus als directe und indirecte Quelle der Scriptores Hist. Aug., 1878, is of=
 much greater value.) Capitolinus and the author of the Vita Macrini, also =
used a work of Junius Cordus who devoted himself to the elucidation of the =
obscurer reigns (xv. 1). But there were other stray sources both Latin and =
Greek. For example Acholius, master of ceremonies to the Emperor Valerian, =
described the journeys of Alexander Severus and was consulted by Lampridius=
 (xviii. 64). The same writer wrote Acta, in the ninth Book of which he dea=
lt with the reign of Valerian (xxvi. 12). For other sources see Teuffel, Ge=
sch. der rom. Litt., =C2=A7 387. The introduction of Vopiscus to his Life o=
f Aurelian is well worth reading. It throws some light on the way in which =
these lives were <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: cur=
rent; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>309<span class=3D"bracke=
t">]</span></span> written and the sources which the writers commanded. We =
learn that Aurelian=E2=80=99s daily acts were written by his own orders in =
<i>libri lintei,</i> and the historian could obtain them from the numbered =
cases<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/gibbon-the-history-of-the=
-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-1#lf0214-01_footnote_nt_830" id=

/a> of the Ulpian Library. The war of Aurelian then was an official account=
 (<i>charactere historico digesta</i>).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_842">The citation of original documents (both genui=
ne and spurious) is a feature of the Historia Augusta. Vopiscus, and perhap=
s the others in some cases, took these directly from the originals in the U=
lpian Library, but in the case of the earlier Lives it is highly probable t=
hat they were drawn, at second hand, from Marius Maximus, who included such=
 <i>pi=C3=A8ces justicatifs</i> in his work.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_843">The uncertainty which prevailed in the reign o=
f Diocletian as to leading events which happened as late as the reign of Au=
relian is illustrated instructively by the dispute among historical student=
s, recorded by Vopiscus, as to whether Firmus, the tyrant of Egypt, had bee=
n invested with the purple, and reigned as an Emperor, or not (xxix. 2).</p=
>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_844">A special word must be said about the Lives of=
 Trebellius Pollio. It has been shown with tolerable certainty, by the inve=
stigations of H. Peter, that all the original documents which he inserts, w=
hether transactions, or letters, or speeches, are forgeries. He has also be=
en convicted of unfairness in his presentation of the personality of Gallie=
nus. When Gibbon says (chap. x. note 156), that the character of that unfor=
tunate prince has been fairly transmitted to us, on the ground that =E2=80=
=9Cthe historians who wrote before the elevation of the family of Constanti=
ne, could not have the most remote interest to misrepresent the character o=
f Gallienus,=E2=80=9D he overlooks the internal evidence in the Biographies=
 of Pollio (as pointed out above) which proves that this writer was actuate=
d by the wish to glorify Constantius indirectly by a glorification of Claud=
ius. He had thus a distinct motive for disparaging the abilities and action=
s of Gallienus. For, by portraying that monarch as incapable of ruling and =
utterly incompetent to cope with the dangers which beset the Empire, he was=
 enabled to suggest a contrast between the contemptible prince and his bril=
liant successor. Through such a contrast the achievements of Claudius seeme=
d more striking. (Recently F. Rothkegel in a treatise on Die Regierung des =
Gallienus, of which the first part has appeared, 1894, has endeavoured to d=
o justice to Gallienus, and show that he was not so bad or incompetent as h=
e has been made out.)</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_845">The best text of the Historia Augusta is that =
of H. Peter, who is the chief authority on the subject. Out of the large li=
terature, which bears on these biographies, I may refer to Gemoll=E2=80=99s=
 Die Script. Hist. Aug., 1886, which has been largely used in this account =
of the Augustan Biographies. Dessau has recently proved (Hermes, 1889) that=
 the Lives were seriously interpolated in the age of Theodosius. His daring=
 thesis that they are entirely forgeries is rejected by Mommsen, who admits=
 the interpolations (<i>ib.</i> 1890).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_846">When the Historia Augusta deserts us, our sour=
ces, whether Greek or Latin, are either late or scrappy. We can extract som=
e historical facts from a number of contemporary <span class=3D"sc">panegyr=

occasions under Maximian and his successors. These will be best consulted i=

 Constantine, on the occasion of the marriage of Constantine with Fausta, M=
aximian=E2=80=99s daughter, 307. No. 7 (probably by Eumenius), is a panegyr=
ic on Constantine, delivered at Trier, shortly after the execution of Maxim=
ian, 310. No. 8 (also plausibly ascribed to Eumenius), is a speech of thank=
sgiving to Constantine for benefits which he bestowed upon Autun, 311. No. =
9 is a eulogy of Constantine pronounced at Trier, early in 313, and contain=
s a brief account of his Italian expedition. No. 10 bears the name of Nazar=
ius, and is likewise a panegyric of Constantine, dating from the fifteenth =
year of his reign, 321. (On Eumenius, cp. Brandt, Eumenius von Augustodunum=
, &amp;c., 1882.)</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_847"><span class=3D"csc">Sextus Aurelius Victor</sp=
an> was appointed (Ammianus tells us, xxi. 10, 6) governor of the Second Pa=

f the City. Inscriptions confirm both statements (see C.I.L. 6, 1186, and O=
relli-Henzen, 3715). He was of African birth (see his C=C3=A6s. 20, 6), and=
 a pagan. Some think that the work known as C=C3=A6sares was composed in it=

n which is shared by W=C3=B6lfflin and others. (A convenient critical editi=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_855">It may be well to note more exactly how Roman =
arms progressed in Britain after Claudius. (Our chief authority is the Agri=
cola of Tacitus.) The first legatus sent by Vespasian was Petillius Cereali=
s, who fought against the Brigantes and subdued the eastern districts of th=
e island as far north as Lincoln <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decorati=
on">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>312<span=
 class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> (Lindum). A line drawn from Chester (Dev=
a) to Lincoln would rightly mark the limits of Roman rule at this time. Cer=
ealis was succeeded by Frontinus (whose treatise on the science of warfare =
is extant), and he reduced the Silures (in the west). Then came Agricola, w=
hose government lasted from 78 to 85 <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"enti=
ty ad">ad</span></span> He attempted to extend the Roman frontiers both nor=
thward and westward, but failed to consolidate his conquests. The only last=
ing fruit of the enterprises of Agricola was the acquisition of York (Ebura=
cum), =E2=80=94 a fact which Tacitus does not record and which we have to i=
nfer.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_856">On p. 45, n. 34, Gibbon mentions nine colonies=
 in Britain, on the authority of Richard of Cirencester, which has no value=
. The only towns, which we know to have had the rank of <i>coloniae,</i> ar=
e Camalodunum, Eburacum, Glevum, Lindum. Verulamium was a municipium.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_857">The first Dacian war of Trajan lasted during 1=
01 and 102 <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> an=
d Trajan celebrated his triumph at the end of the latter year, taking the t=

 107 by the disensions of the barbarians and the suicide of Decebalus. Our =
only contemporary sources for these wars are monumental, =E2=80=94 the scul=
ptures on the Pillar of Trajan and some inscriptions. Unfortunately Trajan=
=E2=80=99s own work on the war has perished. (Arosa and Froehner have publi=

umn of Trajan, Paris, 1872-1874. For details of the war, see Jung, R=C3=B6m=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_858">Trajan=E2=80=99s Dacia must be carefully disti=
nguished from <i>Dacia ripensis</i> south of the Danube, a province formed,=
 as we shall see, at a much later date. The capital of northern Dacia was S=
armizegetusa, a Dacian town, which was founded anew after Trajan=E2=80=99s =
conquest under the name of Ulpia Trajana. The traveller in Siebenb=C3=BCrge=
n may now trace the remains of this historic site at V=C3=A1rbely, as the H=
ungarians have named it. H. Schiller lays stress on one important result of=
 the Dacian war: =E2=80=9CThe military centre of gravity of the Empire=E2=
=80=9D was transferred from the Rhine to the Danube (Gesch. der r=C3=B6m. K=
aiserzeit, i. 554).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_859">Gibbon omits to mention as a third =E2=80=9Cex=
ception,=E2=80=9D besides Britain and Dacia, the acquisition of new territo=
ry in the north of Arabia (east of Palestine), and the organisation of a pr=
ovince of =E2=80=9CArabia=E2=80=9D by Cornelius Palma (106 <span class=3D"s=
c"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span>). This change was accomplishe=
d peacefully; the two important towns of Petra and Bostra had been already =
Roman for a considerable time. The chief value of the province lay in the f=
act that the caravans from the East on their way to Egypt passed through it=
. There are remarkable ruins at Petra which testify to its importance.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_860">Hadrian, as Gibbon explains, narrowed the boun=
daries of the Empire in the East (it may be disputed whether he was right i=
n resigning Great Armenia); but he was diligent in making strong the defenc=
es of what he retained. The Euphrates was a sufficient protection in itself=
; but in other quarters Hadrian found work to do, and did it. He built fort=
s on the northern frontier of Dacia; he completed the rampart which defende=
d the exposed corner between the Danube and Rhine; and it is probable that =
he built the great wall in <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Ed=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_861">It has been said that under no Emperor was the=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_862">In his account of the army Gibbon closely foll=
owed Vegetius, whose statements must be received with caution. I may call a=
ttention here to a few points.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_863">(<i>a</i>) The legion contained ten cohorts; a=
nd the cohort, which had its own standard (<i>signum</i>), six centuries. E=
ach century was commanded by a centurion. Under the early Empire, each legi=
on was commanded by a <i>tribunus militum Augusti</i> (under the republic, =
<i>trib. mil. a populo</i>), who, however, was subject to the authority of =
a higher officer, the <i>legatus legionis,</i> who was supreme commander of=
 both the legion and the auxiliary troops associated with it. In later time=
s (as we learn from Vegetius) the sphere of the tribune was reduced to the =
cohort. The number of soldiers in a legion was elastic, and varied at diffe=
rent times. It is generally reckoned at six thousand foot, and one hundred =
and twenty horsemen (four <i>turmae</i>).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_864">(<i>b</i>) The <i>auxilia</i> included all the=
 standing troops, except the legions, the volunteers (<i>cohortes Italicae =
civium Romanorum voluntariorum</i>), and of course the pr=C3=A6torian guard=
s. They were divided into cohorts, and were under the command of the <i>leg=
ati.</i> Cavalry and infantry were often combined, and constituted a <i>coh=
ors equitata.</i> Each cohort (like the legionary cohort) had its standard,=
 and consisted of six or ten centuries, according to its size, which might =
be five hundred or a thousand men. To be distinguished from the <i>auxilia<=
/i> were a provincial militia, which appear in certain provinces (such as R=
=C3=A6tia, Britain, Dacia). They were not imperial, and were supported by p=
rovincial funds (Mommsen, Die r=C3=B6m. Provinzialmilizen, Hermes, xxii. 4)=
.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_865">(<i>c</i>) The use of =E2=80=9Cartillery=E2=80=
=9D on a large scale was due to Greek influence. It played an important par=
t in the Macedonian army. The fixed number of engines mentioned in the text=
 (ten <i>onagri</i> and fifty-five <i>carroballistae</i>) was perhaps intro=
duced in the time of Vespasian. Vegetius, ii. 25; Josephus, Bell. Jud. 5, 6=
, 3.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_866">(<i>d</i>) As for the distribution of the troo=
ps, Gibbon arrived at his statement by combining what Tacitus tells of the =
reign of Tiberius, and what Dion Cassius tells of the reign of Alexander Se=
verus; always a doubtful method of procedure, and in this case demonstrably=
 leading to erroneous results. Under Tiberius in 23 <span class=3D"sc"><spa=
n class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> there were four legions in Upper Ger=
many, four in Lower Germany, three in Spain, two in Egypt, four in Syria, t=
wo in Pannonia, two in Dalmatia, two in Moesia, two temporarily removed fro=
m Pannonia to Africa. New legions were created by Claudius, Nero, Domitian,=
 &amp;c.; on the other hand, some of the old legions disappeared, or their =
names were changed. Three new legions (i., ii., and iii. Parthica) were ins=
tituted by Septimius Severus. Each legion had a special name. A list of the=
 legions (thirty in number) in the time of Marcus Aurelius will be found in=
 Marquardt, R=C3=B6m. Alterth=C3=BCmer, iii. 2, 356. The history of the Rom=
an legions is a very difficult subject, and the conclusions of Pfitzner (Ge=
schichte der r=C3=B6mischen <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">E=
dition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>314<span clas=

r. E. G. Hardy in the Journal of Philology, xxiii. 29 <i>sqq.</i>).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_867">(<i>e</i>) The <i>cohortes urbanae</i> had the=
ir headquarters in the <i>Forum Suarium</i> (Pig-market) at Rome. They were=
 at first four in number, of one thousand men each, until the time of Claud=
ius, who seems to have increased the number to six; Vespasian perhaps added=
 another. Some of these regiments were sometimes stationed elsewhere; for e=
xample, at Lyons, Ostia, Puteoli.</p>

a province of the Venetian State. Since then (1) the Turkish realm in Europ=
e has been happily reduced, and (2) Austria has advanced at the expense of =
Venice. (1) Now Greece and Servia are each a kingdom, wholly independent of=
 the Turk; Bulgaria is a free principality, only formally dependent on the =
Sultan. Moldavia and Walachia form the independent kingdom of Roumania. Eve=
n a portion of Thrace, south of the Balkans, known as Eastern Roumelia, has=
 been annexed to Bulgaria. Macedonia and the greatest part of Epirus are st=
ill Turkish. (2) All the Dalmatian coast, including Ragusa, belongs to Aust=

teenth century, preserved its independence against the Turks with varying s=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_919">The distinction between colonies and municipal=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_920">=E2=80=9CIt is to be observed that these commu=
nities were either <i>coloni=C3=A6</i> or <i>municipia.</i> In the course o=
f Italian history the word <i>municipium</i> had completely changed its mea=
ning. Originally it was applied to a community possessing <i>ius Latinum,</=
i> and also to the <i>civitas sine suffragio,</i> and thus it was a term of=
 contrast to those communities which possessed full Roman citizenship. But =
when in the course of time the <i>civitates sine suffragio</i> received pol=
itical rights and the Roman states received full Roman citizenship, and thu=
s the <i>municipium</i> proper disappeared from Italy, the word was still a=
pplied to those communities of Roman citizens which had originally been eit=
her Latin <i>municipia</i> or independent federate states. And it also, of =
course, continued to be applied to cities outside Italy which possessed <i>=
ius Latinum.</i> It is clear that originally <i>municipium</i> and <i>colon=
ia</i> were not incompatible ideas. For a colony founded with <i>ius Latinu=
m</i> was both a <i>municipium</i> and a <i>colonia.</i> But a certain oppo=
sition arose between them, and became stronger when <i>municipium</i> came =
to be used in a new sense. <i>Municipium</i> is only used of communities wh=
ich existed as independent states before they received Roman citizenship, w=
hether by the deduction of a colony or not. <i>Colonia</i> is generally con=
fined to those communities which were settled for the first time as Roman c=
ities, and were never states before. Thus <i>municipium</i> involves a refe=
rence to previous autonomy.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_921">=E2=80=9CBesides Roman cities, there were also=
 Latin cities in the provinces. Originally there were two kinds of <i>ius L=
atinum,</i> one better and the other inferior The old Latin colonies posses=
sed the better kind. The inferior kind was known as the <i>ius</i> of Arimi=
num, and it alone was extended to provincial communities. When Italy receiv=
ed Roman citizenship after the Social war, the better kind of <i>ius Latinu=
m</i> vanished for ever, and the leaser kind only existed outside Italy. Th=
e most important privilege which distinguished the Latin from peregrine com=
munities was that the member of a Latin city had a prospect of obtaining fu=
ll Roman citizenship by holding magistracies in his own community. The Lati=
n communities are of course autonomous and are not controlled by the provin=
cial governor; but like Roman communities they have to pay tribute for thei=
r land, which is the property of the Roman people, unless they possess immu=
nity or <i>ius Italicum</i> as well as <i>ius Latinum.</i>=E2=80=9D</p>

 it was not considered one of the necessary prerogatives of the princeps, f=
or that, as Gibbon says, would have meant the destruction of the independen=
ce of the senate. It must be remembered that in the <i>theory</i> of the pr=
incipate the independence of the senate was carefully guarded, though pract=
ically the influence of the princeps was predominant. Augustus discharged t=
he functions of censor repeatedly; not, however, under that name, but as <i=

orship was one of the Imperial prerogatives. He was followed in this by Mer=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_933">The provinces fell into two classes according =

this distinction must not be confounded with that of the titles <i>pro cons=

PRINCIPATE OF SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS =E2=80=94 (<span class=3D"ptr">Pp. 154-161<=
/span>)</h2>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_940">The name of Septimius Severus marks an importa=
nt stage in the development of the Principate of Augustus into the absolute=
 monarchy of Diocletian. If he had been followed by emperors as strong and =
far-sighted as himself, the goal would have been reached sooner; and, moreo=
ver, the tendencies of his policy would have been clearer to us. But the ad=
ministration of his immediate successors was arbitrary; and the reaction un=
der Alexander threw things back. Severus had no Tiberius or Constantine to =
follow him; and like Augustus he committed the error of founding a dynasty.=
 His example was a warning to Diocletian.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_941">The records of his reign show that he took lit=
tle account of the senate, and made much of the army. This has been brought=
 out by Gibbon. But it would be a mistake to call his rule a military despo=
tism. He did not apply military methods to civil affairs. He was more than =
a mere soldier-emperor: he was a considerable statesman.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_942">His influence on constitutional history concer=
ns three important points. (1) He furthered in a very marked way the tenden=
cy, already manifest early in the second century, to remove the line of dis=
tinction between Italy and the provinces. (<i>a</i>) He recruited the Pr=C3=
=A6torian guards, hitherto Italians, from the legionaries, and so from the =
provinces. (<i>b</i>) He encroached on the privileges of Italy by quarterin=
g one of three new legions, which he created, in a camp on Mount Alba near =
Rome. (<i>c</i>) He assumed the proconsular title in Italy. (<i>d</i>) By t=
he bestowal of <i>ius Italicum</i> he elevated a great many provincial citi=
es (in Dacia, Africa, and Syria) to a level with Italy. (2) He increased th=
e importance of the Pr=C3=A6torian prefect. We can see now this post underg=
oing a curious change from a military into a civil office. Held by Papinian=
, it seemed to be the summit in the career not of a soldier but of a jurist=
. (3) The financial policy of Severus in keeping the <i>res privata</i> of =
the princeps distinct from his <i>fiscus,</i> =E2=80=94 crown property as d=
istinguished from state revenue (cp. p. 126, footnote 52).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_943">There is no doubt that the tendency to give ef=
fect to the <i>maius imperium</i> of the princeps in controlling the govern=
ors of the senatorial provinces and the republican magistrates (consuls) wa=
s confirmed and furthered under Severus. For example, governors of senatori=
al provinces are brought before his court, Hist. Aug. x. 4, 8. The <i>maius=
 imperium,</i> used with reserve by the earlier emperors, was one of the ch=
ief constitutional instruments by which the princeps ousted the senate from=
 the government and converted the =E2=80=9Cdyarchy=E2=80=9D into a monarchy=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_945">The chronological difficulties of the year 238=
, which exercised Tillemont, Clinton, Eckbel (vii. 293 <i>sqq.</i>) and Bor=
ghesi, have been recently discussed with care by O. Seeck in a paper in the=
 Rheinisches Museum, xli. (p. 161 <i>sqq.</i>) 1886, and by J. L=C3=B6hrer =
in his monograph de Julio Vero Maximino.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_946">The Chronicler of 354 gives as the length of t=
he reign of Maximin three years, four months, two days, which would give 17=
th March 235 to 18th July 238 (Hist. Aug. xxi. i.). The latter date cannot =
be right (for Alexandrian coins show that the seventh trib. year of Gordian=
 III. ran from 30th August 243, to 29th August 244, proving that Gordian wa=
s elected before 29th August 238; the latest possible date for the dethrone=
ment of Maximus and Balbinus would therefore be 1st August, and in the thir=
teen days between 18th July and that day, there is not room for the arrival=
 of the news of Maximin=E2=80=99s death at Rome, for the journey of Maximus=
 to Aquileia and his stay there); hence Seeck emends menses iii. (for mense=
s iiii.), which gives 17th June for Maximin=E2=80=99s death. He calculates =
that the siege of Aquileia began in the beginning or middle of May.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_947">The Chronicler of 354 gives ninety-nine days f=
or the reign of Maximus and Balbinus; and twenty days for that of the two G=
ordians, but Seeck shows from Zonaras (622 <span class=3D"sc">d.</span>), a=
nd Glycas (243 <span class=3D"sc">c.</span>) that this number should be twe=
nty-two. Allowing roughly 130 days from the elevation of the Gordians to th=
e fall of Maximus and Balbinus, we get 24th March, as the <i>latest possibl=
e</i> date for the elevation of the Gordians. This calculation would suit C=
od. Just. vii. 26, 5 (Imp. Gordianus A. Marino), which is subscribed xii. K=
al. April Pio et Pontiano Coss., and would prove that the reign of Gordianu=
s began before 21st March. But we should have to emend Impp. Gordiani.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_948">It must be remembered that this plausible reco=
nstruction of Seeck depends on the emendation of a text.</p>

=3D"ptr">P. 253</span> <i>sqq.</i>)</h2>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_952">The first European translation of the Avesta w=
as made by Anquetil du Perron, and appeared (in 3 vols.) in 1771, just in t=
ime for Gibbon to make use of. The appearance of this work aroused a storm =
of controversy, chiefly in England, and it is interesting to observe that G=
ibbon was among those who accepted the Avesta as genuine documents of the Z=
oroastrian religion. It is unnecessary to say that in the present century t=
heir antiquity has been abundantly confirmed.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_953">The Avesta is a liturgical collection of fragm=
ents from older texts, and is (as M. Darmesteter remarks) more like a praye=
r-book than a Bible. It consists of two parts, of which the first (1) conta=
ins the Vendid=C3=A2d, the Visper=C3=A2d, and the Yasna. The Vendid=C3=A2d =
(a corruption of <i>vida=C3=AAv=C3=B4-d=C3=A2tem</i> =3D =E2=80=9Cantidemon=
iac law=E2=80=9D) consists of religious laws and legendary tales; the Vispe=
r=C3=A2d, of litanies for sacrifice; and the Yasna, of litanies also, and f=
ive hymns in an older dialect than the rest of the work. The second part (2=
) is the Small Avesta, a collection of short prayers.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_954">Two questions arise: (<i>a</i>) When was the A=
vesta compiled? (<i>b</i>) What is the origin of the older texts which supp=
lied the material?</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_955">(<i>a</i>) It is generally supposed that the A=
vesta was first collected under the Sassanids. But it is stated in a Pahlav=
i authority that the collection was begun under the Arsacids (having been o=
rdered by King Valkash or Vologeses) and completed under the Sassanid Shap=
=C3=BBr II. in the fourth century (<span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity=
 ad">ad</span></span> 309-380). If this is true, we must modify the usual v=
iew of the revival of Mazdeism by Ardesh=C3=AEr the first Sassanid, and reg=
ard his religious movement as merely the thorough realisation of an idea de=
rived from the Parthian princes. M. Darmesteter concludes his discussion of=
 the question thus (Introduction to his translation of the Zend Avesta, p. =
xxxv.): =E2=80=9CIt can be fairly admitted, that even in the time and at th=
e court of the Philhellenic Parthians a Zoroastrian movement may have origi=
nated, and that there came a time when they perceived that a national relig=
ion is a part of national life. It was the merit of the Sassanids that they=
 saw the drift of this idea which they had the good fortune to carry out.=
=E2=80=9D It would of course be vain to attempt to determine which of the f=
our or five kings named Vologeses originated the collection. The completion=
 under Shap=C3=BBr II. is an established fact.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_956">(<i>b</i>) As to the older texts from which th=
e Avesta was put together, Darmesteter concludes that =E2=80=9Cthe original=
 texts of the Avesta were not written by the Persians. . . . They were writ=
ten in Media by the priests of Ragha and Atropatene in the language of Medi=
a, and they exhibit the ideas of the sacerdotal class under the Achaemenian=
 dynasty.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_957">There is a Parsi tradition that of twenty-one =
original books the Vendid=C3=A2d is the sole remaining one. But Zend schola=
rs seem uncertain as to how far this tradition is to be accepted. For the o=
riginal religion of Ahura-mazda, as <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decor=
ation">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>322<s=
pan class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> it existed under the Achaemenians, ou=
r sources are (1) the inscriptions of Darius and his successors, and (2) He=
rodotus and other Greek writers.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-01_958">Those who wish to know more of the Avesta and =
the Zoroastrian religion may be sent to M. Darmesteter=E2=80=99s translatio=
n of the Vendid=C3=A2d (vol. iv. of the =E2=80=9CSacred Books of the East=
=E2=80=9D) and his admirable Introduction, to which I am indebted for the s=
ummary in this note. This translation has superseded those of Spiegel and D=
e Harlez; but it must be observed that the students of the sacred books of =
the Persians constantly disagree in a very marked way, in translation as we=
ll as in interpretation.</p>

 put into literary form in the tenth century (towards its close according t=

epresents the Imperial palace as equal in extent to [greater than] the rest=
 of Rome. The whole region of the Palatine Mount on which it was built occu=
pied, at most, a circumference of eleven or twelve thousand feet. (See the =
Notitia and Victor, in Nardini=E2=80=99s Roma Antica.) But we should recoll=
ect that the opulent senators had almost surrounded the city with their ext=
ensive gardens and suburb palaces, the greatest part of which had been grad=
ually confiscated by the emperors. If Geta resided in the gardens that bore=
 his name on the Janiculum and if Caracalla inhabited the gardens of M=C3=
=A6cenas on the Esquiline, the rival brothers were separated from each othe=
r by the distance of several miles; and yet the intermediate space was fill=
ed by the Imperial gardens of Sallust, of Lucullus, of Agrippa, of Domitian=
, of Caius, &amp;c., all skirting round the city, and all connected with ea=
ch other, and with the palace, by bridges thrown over the Tiber and the str=

3 [36]) informs us that the extraordinary gifts of Caracalla to the army am=
ounted annually to seventy millions of drachm=C3=A6 (about two million thre=
e hundred and fifty thousand pounds). There is another passage in Dion, con=
cerning the military pay, infinitely curious; were it not obscure, imperfec=
t, and probably corrupt. The best sense seems to be, that the Pr=C3=A6toria=
n guards received twelve hundred and fifty drachm=C3=A6 (forty pounds) a ye=
ar. (Dion, l. lxxvii. p. 1307 [24].) Under the reign of Augustus, they were=
 paid at the rate of two drachm=C3=A6, or denarii, per day, 720 a year (Tac=
it. Annal. i. 17). Domitian, who increased the soldiers=E2=80=99 pay one-fo=
urth, must have raised the Pr=C3=A6torians to 960 drachm=C3=A6 (Gronovius d=
e Pecuni=C3=A2 Veteri, l. iii. c. 2). These successive augmentations ruined=
 the empire, for, with the soldiers=E2=80=99 pay, their numbers too were in=
creased. We have seen the Pr=C3=A6torians alone increased from 10,000 to 50=
,000 men. [It has been pointed out by Guizot that Gibbon misunderstood the =
passage of Dion, which refers not to the annual pay of soldiers, but to the=
 recompense given at the end of their term of service. But, as Valois saw, =
the numbers seem to be transposed, for the pr=C3=A6torians received a large=
r sum than the legionaries.]</p></div>

 in this instance judicious and moderate, is contented with eighty-five ele=
phants, distinguished by their size and strength. In Siam, where these anim=
