<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_285"><span class=3D"csc">If</span> we seriously con=
sider the purity of the Christian religion, the sanctity of its moral prece=
pts, and the innocent as well as austere lives of the greater number of tho=
se who, during the first ages, embraced the faith of the gospel, we should =
naturally suppose that so benevolent a doctrine would have been received wi=
th due reverence, even by the unbelieving world; that the learned and the p=
olite, however they might deride the miracles, would have esteemed the virt=
ues of the new sect; and that the magistrates, instead of persecuting, woul=
d have protected an order of men who yielded the most passive obedience to =
the laws, though they declined the active cares of war and government. If, =
on the other hand, we recollect the universal toleration of Polytheism, as =
it was invariably maintained by the faith of the people, the incredulity of=
 philosophers, and the policy of the Roman senate and emperors, we are at a=
 loss to discover what new offence the Christians had committed, what new p=
rovocation could exasperate the mild indifference of antiquity, and what ne=
w motives could urge the Roman princes, who beheld, without concern, a thou=
sand forms of religion subsisting in peace under their gentle sway, to infl=
ict a severe punishment on any part of their subjects, who had chosen for t=
hemselves a singular, but an inoffensive, mode of faith and worship.</p>
<span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </spa=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_286">The religious policy of the ancient world seem=
s to have assumed a more stern and intolerant character, to oppose the prog=
ress of Christianity. About fourscore years after the death of Christ, his =
innocent disciples were punished with death, by the sentence of a proconsul=
 of the most amiable and philosophic character, and, according to the laws =
of an emperor, distinguished by the wisdom and justice of his general admin=
istration. The apologies which were repeatedly addressed to the successors =
of Trajan, are filled with the most pathetic complaints, that the Christian=
s, who obeyed the dictates, and solicited the liberty, of conscience, were =
alone, among all the subjects of the Roman empire, excluded from the common=
 benefits of their auspicious government. The deaths of a few eminent marty=
rs have been recorded with care; and from the time that Christianity was in=
vested with the supreme power, the governors of the church have been no les=
s diligently employed in displaying the cruelty, than in imitating the cond=
uct, of their Pagan adversaries. To separate (if it be possible) a few auth=
entic, as well as interesting, facts, from an undigested mass of fiction an=
d error, and to relate, in a clear and rational manner, the causes, the ext=
ent, the duration, and the most important circumstances of the persecutions=
 to which the first Christians were exposed, is the design of the present C=
hapter.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_287">The sectaries of a persecuted religion, depres=
sed by fear, animated with resentment, and perhaps heated by enthusiasm, ar=
e seldom in a proper temper of mind calmly to investigate, or candidly to a=
ppreciate, the motives of their enemies, which often escape the impartial a=
nd discerning view even of those who are placed at a secure distance from t=
he flames of persecution. A reason has been assigned for the conduct of the=
 emperors towards the primitive Christians, which may appear the more speci=
ous and probable as it is drawn from the acknowledged genius of Polytheism.=
 It has already been observed that the religious concord of the world was p=
rincipally supported by the implicit assent and reverence which the <span c=
lass=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span=
 class=3D"bracket">[</span>3<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> nations=
 of antiquity expressed for their respective traditions and ceremonies. It =
might therefore be expected that they would unite with indignation against =
any sect of people which should separate itself from the communion of manki=
nd, and, claiming the exclusive possession of divine knowledge, should disd=
ain every form of worship, except its own, as impious and idolatrous. The r=
ights of toleration were held by mutual indulgence; they were justly forfei=
ted by a refusal of the accustomed tribute. As the payment of this tribute =
was inflexibly refused by the Jews, and by them alone, the consideration of=

spect the sacred institutions of their neighbours, it was incumbent on them=
, to persevere in those of their ancestors. The voice of oracles, the prece=
pts of philosophers, and the authority of the laws unanimously enforced thi=
s national obligation. By their lofty claim of superior sanctity, the Jews =
might provoke the Polytheists to consider them as an odious and impure race=
. By disdaining the intercourse of other nations they might deserve their c=

and presumptuously despised whatever their fathers had believed as true, or=
 had reverenced as sacred. Nor was this apostacy (if we may use the express=

ew himself from the temples of Egypt or Syria would equally disdain to seek=
 an asylum in those of Athens or Carthage. Every Christian rejected with co=
ntempt the superstitions of his family, his city, and his province. The who=

that the conduct of the emperors who appeared the least favourable to the p=

 have employed the arm of violence and terror against the religious opinion=

 own feelings, a Charles V. or a Louis XIV. might have acquired a just know=
ledge of the rights of conscience, of the obligation of faith, and of the i=
nnocence of error. But the princes and magistrates of ancient Rome were str=
angers to those principles which inspired and authorised the inflexible obs=
tinacy of the Christians in the cause of truth, nor could they themselves d=
iscover in their own breasts any motive which would have prompted them to r=
efuse a legal, and as it were a natural, submission to the sacred instituti=
ons of their country. The same reason which contributes to alleviate the gu=
ilt, must have tended to abate the rigour, of their persecutions. As they w=

ice; and, though they might sometimes exert the licentious privilege of sed=
ition, they no longer possessed the administration of criminal justice; nor=
 did they find it easy to infuse into the calm breast of a Roman magistrate=
 the rancour of their own zeal and prejudice. The provincial governors decl=
ared themselves ready to listen to any accusation that might affect the pub=

Jewish laws and prophecies, they deemed it unworthy of the majesty of Rome =

the duty of the annalist to adopt the narratives of contemporaries; but it =
was natural for the philosopher to indulge himself in the description of th=

 thrown to the lions. Prudence suggested the necessity of a temporary retre=

their own sufferings; but the celebrated number of <i>ten</i> persecutions =
has been determined by the ecclesiastical writers of the fifth century, who=
 possessed a more distinct view of the prosperous or adverse fortunes of th=
e church, from the age of Nero to that of Diocletian. The ingenious paralle=
ls of the <i>ten</i> plagues of Egypt and of the <i>ten</i> horns of the Ap=
ocalypse first suggested this calculation to their minds; and in their appl=
ication of the faith of prophecy to the truth of history they were careful =
to select those reigns which were indeed the most hostile to the Christian =

ations of his friend and benefactor, and that any measures in favour of the=
 Christians would obtain the approbation of Constantine. But the emperor wo=
uld not venture to insert in the preamble the name of Maximin, whose consen=
t was of the greatest importance, and who succeeded a few days afterwards t=
o the provinces of Asia. In the first six months, however, of his new reign=
, Maximin affected to adopt the prudent counsels of his predecessor; and, t=
hough he never condescended to secure the tranquillity of the church by a p=
ublic edict, Sabinus, his Pr=C3=A6torian prefect, addressed a circular lett=
er to all the governors and magistrates of the provinces, expatiating on th=
e Imperial clemency, acknowledging the invincible obstinacy of the Christia=
ns, and directing the officers of justice to cease their ineffectual prosec=
utions and to connive at the secret assemblies of those enthusiasts. In con=
sequence of these orders, great numbers of Christians were released from pr=
ison or delivered from the mines. The confessors, singing hymns of triumph,=
 returned into their own countries; and those who had yielded to the violen=

 the soul of Maximin. The former suggested the means, the latter pointed ou=

he gods, to the study of magic, and to the belief of oracles. The prophets =
or philosophers, whom he revered as the favourites of heaven, were frequent=
ly raised to the government of provinces and admitted into his most secret =
counsels. They easily convinced him that the Christians had been indebted f=
or their victories to their regular discipline, and that the weakness of Po=
lytheism had principally flowed from a want of union and subordination amon=
g the ministers of religion. A system of government was therefore institute=
d, which was evidently copied from the policy of the church. In all the gre=
at cities of the empire, the temples were repaired and beautified by the or=
der of Maximin; and the officiating priests of the various deities were sub=
jected to the authority of a superior pontiff, destined to oppose the bisho=
p and to promote the cause of Paganism. These pontiffs acknowledged, in the=
ir turn, the supreme jurisdiction of the metropolitans or high priests of t=
he province, who acted as the immediate vicegerents of the emperor himself.=
 A white robe was the ensign of their dignity; and these new prelates were =
carefully selected from the most noble and opulent families. By the influen=
ce of the magistrates and of the sacerdotal order, a great number of dutifu=
l addresses were obtained, particularly from the cities of Nicomedia, Antio=
ch, and Tyre, which artfully represented the well-known intentions of the c=
ourt as the general sense of the people; solicited the emperor to consult t=
he laws of justice rather than the dictates of his clemency; expressed thei=
r abhorrence of the Christians; and humbly prayed that those impious sectar=
ies might at least be excluded from the limits of their respective territor=
ies. The answer of Maximin to the address which he obtained from the citize=

the highest satisfaction, descants on the obstinate impiety of the Christia=

and the habits of forty years. Rome was insensibly confounded with the depe=

f the C=C3=A6sars was viewed with cold indifference by a martial prince, bo=
rn in the neighbourhood of the Danube, educated in the courts and armies of=
 Asia, and invested with the purple by the legions of Britain. The Italians=
, who had received Constantine as their deliverer, submissively obeyed the =
edicts which he sometimes condescended to address to the senate and people =
of Rome; but they were seldom honoured with the presence of their new sover=
eign. During the vigour of his age, Constantine, according to the various e=

ce, along the frontiers of his extensive dominions; and was always prepared=
 to take the field either against a foreign or a domestic enemy. But, as he=
 gradually reached the summit of prosperity and the decline of life, he beg=
an to meditate the design of fixing in a more permanent station the strengt=

 arm, the barbarians who dwelt between the Danube and the Tanais; to watch =
with an eye of jealousy the conduct of the Persian monarch, who indignantly=
 supported the yoke of an ignominious treaty. With these views Diocletian h=

 affected only the freedom or the fortunes of the subject; though, from a p=

the principal cities which formed the boundary of their respective dominion=

e had been enriched by Nature with her choicest endowments. His stature was=
 lofty, his countenance majestic, his deportment graceful; his strength and=
 activity were displayed in every manly exercise, and from his earliest you=
th to a very advanced season of life, he preserved the vigour of his consti=
tution by a strict adherence to the domestic virtues of chastity and temper=
ance. He delighted in the social intercourse of familiar conversation; and,=
 though he might sometimes indulge his disposition to raillery with less re=
serve than was required by the severe dignity of his station, the courtesy =
and liberality of his manners gained the hearts of all who approached him. =
The sincerity of his friendship has been suspected; yet he shewed, on some =
occasions, that he was not incapable of a warm and lasting attachment. The =
disadvantage of an illiterate education had not prevented him from forming =
a just estimate of the value of learning; and the arts and sciences derived=
 some encouragement from the munificent protection of Constantine. In the d=
espatch of business, his diligence was indefatigable; and the active powers=
 of his mind were almost continually exercised in reading, writing, or medi=
tating, in giving audience to ambassadors, and in examining the complaints =
of his subjects. Even those who censured the propriety of his measures were=
 compelled to acknowledge that he possessed magnanimity to conceive, and pa=
tience to execute, the most arduous designs, without being checked either b=
y the prejudices of education or by the clamours of the multitude. In the f=

the royal youths in the science of government and the knowledge of mankind.=
 But the genius of Constantine himself had been formed by adversity and exp=
erience. In the free intercourse of private life, and amidst the dangers of=
 the court of Galerius, he had learned <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"de=
coration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>18=
3<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> to command his own passions, to en=
counter those of his equals, and to depend for his present safety and futur=
e greatness on the prudence and firmness of his personal conduct. His desti=
ned successors had the misfortune of being born and educated in the Imperia=
l purple. Incessantly surrounded with a train of flatterers, they passed th=
eir youth in the enjoyment of luxury and the expectation of a throne; nor w=
ould the dignity of their rank permit them to descend from that elevated st=
ation from whence the various characters of human nature appear to wear a s=
mooth and uniform aspect. The indulgence of Constantine admitted them at a =
very tender age to share the administration of the empire; and they studied=
 the art of reigning at the expense of the people entrusted to their care. =
The younger Constantine was appointed to hold his court in Gaul; and his br=
other Constantius exchanged that department, the ancient patrimony of their=
 father, for the more opulent, but less martial, countries of the East. Ita=
ly, the Western Illyricum, and Africa were accustomed to revere Constans, t=
he third of his sons, as the representative of the great Constantine. He fi=
xed Dalmatius on the Gothic frontier, to which he annexed the government of=
 Thrace, Macedonia, and Greece. The city of C=C3=A6sarea was chosen for the=
 residence of Hannibalianus; and the provinces of Pontus, Cappadocia, and t=
he Lesser Armenia were destined to form the extent of his new kingdom. For =
each of these princes a suitable establishment was provided. A just proport=
ion of guards, of legions, and of auxiliaries was allotted for their respec=
tive dignity and defence. The ministers and generals who were placed about =
their persons were such as Constantine could trust to assist, and even to c=
ontrol, these youthful sovereigns in the exercise of their delegated power.=
 As they advanced in years and experience, the limits of their authority we=
re insensibly enlarged: but the emperor always reserved for himself the tit=

tuary band, suited for rapine rather than for conquest, he suddenly broke i=
nto the dominions of Constans, by he way of the Julian Alps, and the countr=

Constans, who then resided in Dacia, were directed with more prudence and a=
bility. On the news of his brother=E2=80=99s invasion, he despatched a sele=
ct and disciplined body of his Illyrian troops, proposing to follow them in=
 person with the remainder of his forces. But the conduct of his lieutenant=
s soon terminated the unnatural contest. By the artful appearances of fligh=
t, Constantine was betrayed into an ambuscade, which had been concealed in =
a wood, where the rash youth, with a few attendants, was surprised, surroun=
ded, and slain. His body, after it had been found in the obscure stream of =
the Alsa, obtained the honours of an Imperial sepulchre; but his provinces =
transferred their allegiance to the conqueror, who, refusing to admit his e=

 himself with the ambitious Constantina; and to acknowledge in the treaty t=

reserved was sometimes interrupted by loud bursts of clamour or of applause=

 upon to explain the situation of public affairs: the precedency of rank wa=

while he tragically lamented the cruel murder of Constans, he insinuated th=
at none, except a brother, could claim a right to the succession of his bro=

berality of the great Constantine, to whose sons they had engaged their all=
egiance by an oath of fidelity, which the ingratitude of his most favoured =
servants had tempted them to violate. The officers, who surrounded the trib=
unal and were instructed to act their parts in this extraordinary scene, co=
nfessed the irresistible power of reason and eloquence by saluting the empe=

the courage of Vetranio, who stood, amidst the defection of his followers, =
in anxious and silent suspense. Instead of embracing the last refuge of gen=
erous despair, he tamely submitted to his fate; and taking the diadem from =
his head, in view of both armies, fell prostrate at the feet of his conquer=
or. Constantius used his victory with prudence and moderation; and raising =
from the ground the aged suppliant, whom he affected to style by the endear=

ty of Prusa was assigned for the exile or retirement of the abdicated monar=

 beholding, after an absence of thirty-two years, the sacred person of thei=

ffected surprise that the human race should thus suddenly be collected on t=
he same spot. The son of Constantine was lodged in the ancient palace of Au=

antheon, the massy greatness of the amphitheatre of Titus, the elegant arch=
itecture of the theatre of Pompey and the Temple of Peace, and, above all, =

ieces all that encountered his march, penetrated into the heart of the coun=
try of the Quadi, and severely retaliated the calamities which they had inf=
licted on the Roman province. The dismayed Barbarians were soon reduced to =
sue for peace: they offered the restitution of his captive subjects as an a=
tonement for the past, and the noblest hostages as a pledge of their future=
 conduct. The generous courtesy which was shown to the first among their ch=
ieftains who implored the clemency of Constantius encouraged the more timid=

as crowded with the princes and ambassadors of the most distant tribes, who=
 occupied the plains of the Lesser Poland, and who might have deemed themse=
lves secure behind the lofty ridge of the Carpathian mountains. While Const=
antius gave laws to the Barbarians beyond the Danube, he distinguished with=
 specious compassion the Sarmatian exiles who had been expelled from their =
native country by the rebellion of <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decora=
tion">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>247<sp=
an class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> their slaves, and who formed a very co=
nsiderable accession to the power of the Quadi. The emperor, embracing a ge=
nerous but artful system of policy, released the Sarmatians from the bands =
of this humiliating dependence, and restored them, by a separate treaty, to=
 the dignity of a nation united under the government of a king, the friend =
and ally of the republic. He declared his resolution of asserting the justi=
ce of their cause, and of securing the peace of the provinces by the extirp=
ation, or at least the banishment, of the Limigantes, whose manners were st=
ill infected with the vices of their servile origin. The execution of this =
design was attended with more difficulty than glory. The territory of the L=
imigantes was protected against the Romans by the Danube, against the hosti=
le Barbarians by the Theiss. The marshy lands which lay between those river=
s, and were often covered by their inundations, formed an intricate wildern=
ess, pervious only to the inhabitants, who were acquainted with its secret =
paths and inaccessible fortresses. On the approach of Constantius, the Limi=
gantes tried the efficacy of prayers, of fraud, and of arms; but he sternly=
 rejected their supplications, defeated their rude stratagems, and repelled=
 with skill and firmness the efforts of their irregular valour. One of thei=
r most warlike tribes, established in a small island towards the conflux of=
 the Theiss and the Danube, consented to pass the river with the intention =
of surprising the emperor during the security of an amicable conference. Th=
ey soon became the victims of the perfidy which they meditated. Encompassed=
 on every side, trampled down by the cavalry, slaughtered by the swords of =
the legions, they disdained to ask for mercy; and with an undaunted counten=
ance still grasped their weapons in the agonies of death. After this victor=
y a considerable body of Romans was landed on the opposite banks of the Dan=
ube; the Taifal=C3=A6, a Gothic tribe engaged in the service of the empire,=
 invaded the Limigantes <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Editi=
on: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>248<span class=3D=
"bracket">]</span></span> on the side of the Theiss; and their former maste=
rs, the free Sarmatians, animated by hope and revenge, penetrated through t=
he hilly country into the heart of their ancient possessions. A general con=
flagration revealed the huts of the Barbarians, which were seated in the de=
pth of the wilderness; and the soldier fought with confidence on marshy gro=
und, which it was dangerous for him to tread. In this extremity the bravest=
 of the Limigantes were resolved to die in arms, rather than to yield: but =
the milder sentiment, enforced by the authority of their elders, at length =
prevailed; and the suppliant crowd, followed by their wives and children, r=
epaired to the Imperial camp, to learn their fate from the mouth of the con=
queror. After celebrating his own clemency, which was still inclined to par=
don their repeated crimes and to spare the remnant of a guilty nation, Cons=
tantius assigned for the place of their exile a remote country, where they =
might enjoy a safe and honourable repose. The Limigantes obeyed with reluct=
ance; but before they could reach, at least before they could occupy, their=
 destined habitations, they returned to the banks of the Danube, exaggerati=
ng the hardships of their situation, and requesting, with fervent professio=
ns of fidelity, that the emperor would grant them an undisturbed settlement=
 within the limits of the Roman provinces. Instead of consulting his own ex=
perience of their incurable perfidy, Constantius listened to his flatterers=
, who were ready to represent the honour and advantage of accepting a colon=
y of soldiers, at a time when it was much easier to obtain the pecuniary co=
ntributions than the military service of the subjects of the empire. The Li=
migantes were permitted to pass the Danube; and the emperor gave audience t=
o the multitude in a large plain near the modern city of Buda. They surroun=
ded the tribunal, and seemed to hear with respect an oration full of mildne=
ss and dignity; when one of the Barbarians, casting his shoe into the air, =
exclaimed with a loud voice, <i>Marha! Marha!</i> a word of defiance, which=
 was <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: =

 the person of the emperor; his royal throne and golden couch were pillaged=
 by these rude hands; but the faithful defence of his guards, who died at h=
is feet, allowed him a moment to mount a fleet horse, and to escape from th=
e confusion. The disgrace which had been incurred by a treacherous surprise=
 was soon retrieved by the numbers and discipline of the Romans; and the co=
mbat was only terminated by the extinction of the name and nation of the Li=
migantes. The free Sarmatians were reinstated in the possession of their an=
cient seats; and, although Constantius distrusted the levity of their chara=
cter, he entertained some hopes that a sense of gratitude might influence t=
heir future conduct. He had remarked the lofty stature and obsequious demea=
nour of Zizais, one of the noblest of their chiefs. He conferred on him the=
 title of King; and Zizais proved that he was not unworthy to reign by a si=
ncere and lasting attachment to the interest of his benefactor, who, after =
this splendid success, received the name of <i>Sarmaticus</i> from the accl=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_458">But the counsels of princes are more frequentl=
y influenced by views of temporal advantage than by considerations of abstr=
act and speculative truth. The partial and increasing favour of Constantine=
 may naturally be referred to the esteem which he entertained for the moral=
 character of the Christians; and to a persuasion that the propagation of t=
he gospel would inculcate the practice of private and public virtue. Whatev=
er latitude an absolute monarch may assume in his own conduct, whatever ind=
ulgence he may claim for his own passions, it is undoubtedly his interest t=
hat all his subjects should respect the natural and civil obligations of so=
ciety. But the operation of the wisest laws is imperfect and precarious. Th=
ey seldom inspire virtue, they cannot always restrain vice. Their power is =
insufficient to prohibit all that they condemn, nor can they always punish =
the actions which they prohibit. The legislators of antiquity had summoned =
to their aid the powers of education and of opinion. But every principle wh=

 benevolent, and universal system of ethics, adapted to every duty and ever=
y condition of life; recommended as the will and reason of the Supreme Deit=
y, and enforced by the sanction of eternal rewards or punishments. The expe=

degraded, or at least dishonoured, by the odious crime of delivering the Ho=
ly Scriptures to the officers of Diocletian. From their mutual reproaches, =
as well as from the story of this dark transaction, it may justly be inferr=
ed that the late persecution had embittered the zeal, without reforming the=
 manners, of the African Christians. That divided church was incapable of a=
ffording an impartial judicature; the controversy was solemnly tried in fiv=
e successive tribunals which were appointed by the emperor; and the whole p=
roceeding, from the first appeal to the final sentence, lasted above three =
years. A severe inquisition, which was taken by the Pr=C3=A6torian vicar an=
d the proconsul of Africa, the report of two episcopal visitors who had bee=
n sent to Carthage, the decrees of the councils of Rome and of Arles, and t=
he supreme judgment of Constantine himself in his sacred consistory, were a=

edged by the civil and ecclesiastical powers as the true and lawful primate=
 of Africa. The honours and estates of the church were attributed to <i>his=
</i> suffragan bishops, and it was not without difficulty that Constantine =
was satisfied with inflicting the punishment of exile on the principal lead=
ers of the Donatist faction. As their cause was examined with attention, pe=
rhaps it was determined with justice. Perhaps their complaint was not witho=
ut foundation, that the credulity of the emperor had been abused by the ins=
idious arts of his favourite Osius. The influence of falsehood and corrupti=
on might procure the condemnation of the innocent, or aggravate the sentenc=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_483">But this incident, so inconsiderable that it s=

prehension of being involved in the general penalties of rebellion, engaged=
 them to promise their support to the destined successor of Athanasius, the=
 famous George of Cappadocia. The usurper, after receiving the consecration=
 of an Arian synod, was placed on the episcopal throne by the arms of Sebas=

nd the same city was often disputed, under the reign of Constantius, by two=
, or three, or even four bishops, who exercised their spiritual jurisdictio=
n over their respective followers, and alternately lost and regained the te=
mporal possessions of the church. The abuse of Christianity introduced into=
 the Roman government new causes of tyranny and sedition; the bands of civi=
l society were torn asunder by the fury of religious factions; and the obsc=
ure citizen, who might calmly have surveyed the elevation and fall of succe=
ssive emperors, imagined and experienced that his own life and fortune were=
 connected with the interests of a popular ecclesiastic. The example of the=
 two capitals, Rome and Constantinople, may serve to represent the state of=
 the empire, and the temper of mankind, under the reign of the sons of Cons=

 his station and his principles, was guarded by the warm attachment of a gr=

person of the bishop, either by stratagem or by open force. The order was o=
beyed; and Liberius, with the greatest difficulty, at the hour of midnight,=
 was swiftly conveyed beyond the reach of the Roman people, before their co=

unuchs, had been irregularly chosen and consecrated within the walls of a p=
rofane palace. At the end of two years, their pious obstinacy subsisted ent=
ire and unshaken; and, when Constantius visited Rome, he was assailed by th=
e importunate solicitations of a people, who had preserved, as the last rem=

amiliar insolence. The wives of many of the senators and most honourable ci=
tizens, after pressing their husbands to intercede in favour of Liberius, w=
ere advised to undertake a commission, which, in their hands, would be less=
 dangerous and might prove more successful. The emperor received with polit=
eness these female deputies, whose wealth and dignity were displayed in the=
 magnificence of their dress and ornaments: he admired their inflexible res=
olution of following their beloved pastor to the most distant regions of th=
e earth, and consented that the two bishops, Liberius and Felix, should gov=
ern in peace their respective congregations. But the ideas of toleration we=
re so repugnant to the practice, and even to the sentiments, of those times=
 that, when the answer of Constantius was publicly read in the Circus of Ro=
me, so reasonable a project of accommodation was rejected with contempt and=
 ridicule. The eager vehemence which animated the spectators in the decisiv=

=E2=80=9COne God, One Christ, One Bishop.=E2=80=9D The zeal of the Roman pe=

E CHRISTIANS =E2=80=94 (<span class=3D"ptr">P. 30</span>)</h2>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_524">The authenticity of this edict has not yet bee=
n finally determined. It has come down to us in three forms: (1) in Eusebiu=
s, H.E. iv. 13, (2) in Rufinus, H.E. iv. 13, which is merely a free renderi=
ng of the Greek text in Eusebius, and does not rest on a Latin original, (3=
) in a fourteenth century MS. of Justin. Harnack, who has thoroughly discus=
sed the whole question (in his Texte u. Untersuch. xiii. 4), has shown sati=
sfactorily that the version in Justin is not independent, but is taken from=
 Eusebius with certain =E2=80=9Ctendenzi=C3=B6s=E2=80=9D changes. The most =
striking difference between the Justin version and the Eusebian (Rufinus) i=
s in the title; in the former the edict is attributed to Titus, in the latt=
er to Marcus. But the context in Eusebius shows that he regarded the edict =
as issuing from Titus; and so it would seem, as Harnack suggests, that he f=
ound the incorrect title in his source and did not venture to omit or alter=
 it, while he assumed it to be wrong. But in any case, the title is a clums=
y forgery, for Marcus is described as =CE=91=CF=81=CE=BC=CE=AD=CE=BD=CE=B9=
=CE=BF=CF=82 (he did not possess the true title =E1=BC=88=CF=81=CE=BC=CE=B5=
=CE=BD=CE=B9=CE=B1=CE=BA=CF=8C=CF=82 so early as 161), and the name of Luci=
us Verus his colleague does not appear. In regard to the authenticity of th=
e rescript as Eusebius gives it, Harnack points out that he had a Greek, no=
t a Latin (as in other cases, iv. 9; vii. 13; viii. 17), copy before him, a=
nd that this cannot have been the original. The comparison between the beha=
viour of Christians and pagans to the advantage of the former is clearly a =
Christian interpolation. Harnack attempts to restore the original Greek for=
m of the rescript, in whose authenticity he believes (though he owns that c=
ertainty cannot be attained). The rescript was an answer to a petition of t=
he =CE=BA=CE=BF=CE=B9=CE=BD=CF=8C=CE=BD of Asia, and Harnack thinks that th=
e copy used by Eusebius was preserved (and interpolated) in Christian circl=
es.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_525">The difference between the rescripts of Hadria=
n and Antoninus was that the former protected the Christians against calumn=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_538">A considerable literature has sprung up in rec=
ent years regarding the attitude of the Roman government to Christianity fr=
om Nero to Marcus Aurelius (Th. Keim, Rom und das Christenthum, ed. Ziegler=
, 1881; K. J. Neumann, der r=C3=B6mische Staat und die allgemeine Kirche, v=
ol. i. 1890; Th. Mommsen, der Religionsfrevel nach r=C3=B6mischem Recht, in=
 Sybel=E2=80=99s Hist. Zeitschrift, 1890; Professor Ramsay=E2=80=99s The Ch=
urch in the Roman Empire, 1893; may be mentioned). A thorough and instructi=
ve discussion of the whole question will be found in Mr. E. G. Hardy=E2=80=
=99s Christianity and the Roman Government, 1894. A summary of some of his =
results will illustrate the sixteenth chapter of Gibbon.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_539">From a review of the practical policy of the R=
oman state towards foreign cults Mr. Hardy concludes that they were tolerat=
ed in so far as they did not (1) injure the national religion, (2) encourag=
e gross immoralities, (3) seem likely to lead to political disaffection (p.=
 35-6). Various considerations led to the toleration of Judaism, and Mr. Ha=
rdy points out that its toleration would by no means logically lead to that=
 of Christianity, a religion =E2=80=9Cclaiming to overstep all limits of na=
tionality=E2=80=9D (p. 37). The contact between the state and the Christian=
s at Rome in 64 <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span>,</sp=
an> on the occasion of the conflagration, was accidental. The charge of inc=
endiarism broke down at the trials, but it was converted into a charge of <=
i>odium generis humani</i> (a brief summary of the antisocialism and other =
characteristics of Christianity). It was for this that they were punished; =
and Suetonius does not bring their punishment into connection with the fire=
, which was the occasion, not the ground, of their condemnation (Ner. 16: a=
dflicti suppliciis Christiani genus hominum superstitionis nou=C3=A6 ac mal=
efic=C3=A6). Mr. Hardy seems to have quite made out his point that in the N=
eronian persecution the Christians were condemned as Christians, not on any=
 special charge.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_540">This charge <i>odium generis humani,</i> for t=
he use of which the Neronian <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">=
Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>419<span cla=
ss=3D"bracket">]</span></span> episode set a precedent, did not come under =
<i>maiestas</i> of the formula of any regular <i>qu=C3=A6stio.</i> Accordin=
g to Mommsen, whose view in this respect Mr. Hardy accepts, it was a matter=
 for police regulation, to be dealt with by virtue of the <i>coercitio</i> =
vested in magistrates. In Rome, such cases would come under the jurisdictio=
n of the prefect of the city (Tac. Ann. vi. 11); and the provincial governo=
r was empowered to deal with them by his instructions to maintain the peace=
 and tranquillity of his province, =E2=80=9Cwhich he will find no difficult=
y in effecting, if he be careful <i>ut malis hominibus provincia careat cos=
que conquirat</i>=E2=80=9D (<i>e.g., sacrilegi, latrones,</i> &amp;c.). Mr.=
 Ramsay holds that a new principle was introduced into the State policy tow=
ards Christians between 65 and 95 <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity =
ad">ad</span>,</span> namely that whereas under Nero they were attacked by =
charges of special and definite crimes (incendiarism), under the Flavians C=
hristianity itself became a punishable offence. But if Mr. Hardy is right a=
s to the Neronian persecution, this change in attitude would disappear. =E2=
=80=9CAs soon as the Christians were once convicted of an <i>odium generis =
humani,</i> they were potentially outlaws and brigands and could be treated=
 by the police administration as such, whether in Rome or the provinces=E2=
=80=9D (p. 82). That the distinction between Judaism and Christianity had b=
een clearly recognised in the East as early as 70 <span class=3D"sc"><span =
class=3D"entity ad">ad</span>,</span> is proved by the speech of Titus in S=
ulpicius Severus, ii. 30 (taken from a lost book of Tacitus, as we may with=
 some confidence assume); one of the advantages of the destruction of Jerus=
alem will be, that prince is reported to say, the extirpation of the Jewish=
 and the Christian religion. We need not infer, as Mr. Hardy points out, th=
at Titus had special designs against the Christians: =E2=80=9Cthe persecuti=
on of the Christians was a standing one like that of brigands=E2=80=9D (Mom=
msen).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_541">=E2=80=9CWith Roman citizens,=E2=80=9D however=
, =E2=80=9Cof standing and importance a more definite charge was necessary,=
 and this we find from Dio Cassius was primarily =E1=BC=80=CE=B8=CE=B5=CE=
=BF=CF=84=CE=B7=CF=82, <i>i.e.,</i> not so much <i>sacrilegium</i> as a ref=
usal to worship the national gods of the state=E2=80=9D (p. 88). This was a=
pplied in the case of Flavius Clemens, cousin of Domitian, who was executed=
, and his wife Domitilla, who was banished, 95 <span class=3D"sc"><span cla=
ss=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> The reign of Domitian introduced no new p=
rinciple, but a very convenient test =E2=80=94 <i>e.g.,</i> the observance =
of the imperial cult =E2=80=94 for discovering whether a person suspected o=
f the crime of Christianity (a crime, that is, in the eyes of the police ad=
ministration, not of the law) was justly suspected.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_542">Nor does the Bithynian persecution introduce (=
according to Mr. Hardy) any new principle. The letter of Trajan to Pliny is=
 described (p. 117) as =E2=80=9Cthe decision of a practical statesman who d=
eclined on the one hand to be led into severe repressive measures against a=
 body which was only remotely and theoretically dangerous to the state, whi=
le he, on the other, refused to give up on humanitarian grounds the claim o=
f the state to absolute obedience on the part of all its subjects.=E2=80=9D=
 It is in no sense an edict of proscription or of toleration, but it is =E2=
=80=9Can index of the imperial policy=E2=80=9D (p. 122).<a href=3D"https://=

s rescript to Minucius Fundanus (whose genuineness is by no means above sus=
picion), Mr. Hardy considers (143) that it =E2=80=9Cwas intended, as indeed=
 it naturally would be, for the special circumstances of Asia: it does not =
in any way, as I interpret it, rescind the decision of Trajan that the <i>n=
omen</i> was a crime, but to avoid any miscarriage of justice . . . it lays=
 down more stringent conditions for the proof of punishable crime.=E2=80=9D=
 Under M. Antoninus and his successor things remained theoretically the sam=
e. In the reign of the former there were some persecutions, =E2=80=94 Ptole=
m=C3=A6us and Lucius <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition:=

rding to M. Waddington=E2=80=99s date) Polycarp at Smyrna. The remarkable p=
oint in the persecutions of Aurelius is that they take place in the western=
 as well as the eastern provinces, and not so much their extent or the numb=
er of victims (p. 147). In general tenor these conclusions agree with the v=
iew of Mommsen and Ramsay that there were no <i>laws</i> against the Christ=
ians. I cannot see that this has been made out, for the second century at l=
east, though it may be true of the Flavian period. It does not appear that =
the explicit statement of Sulpicius Severus in ii. 29, <i>post etiam datis =

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_543">Gibbon=E2=80=99s general view of the slight ex=
tent of the early persecutions, resting as it does on the strong testimony =
of Origen (c. Cels. 3, 8), is commonly admitted. Compare Hardy, p. 131: =E2=
=80=9CThere seems good reason to suppose that this state of things =E2=80=

onally interrupted by violent manifestations of popular feeling, which prov=
incial governors had either not the will or not the strength to resist =E2=
=80=94 continued throughout the second century: that the Christians were st=
ill punished for the name, but that the initiative in the way of searching =
them out was not taken by the governors, while accusers had to come forward=
 in their own name; and finally, that the number of victims was on the whol=
e a comparatively small one.=E2=80=9D It must at the same time be remembere=
d that it was the policy of the Apologists (on whose evidence our knowledge=
 is largely based) =E2=80=9Cto accentuate and in a measure to exaggerate th=

their own, or at any rate to omit anything unfavourable to their own cause=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_544">Two important documents give a notion of the p=

 first years of Commodus (Armenian version of a lost Greek original, discov=
ered by Mr. Conybeare, who has given a translation in his Acts and Monument=
s of Early Christianity). The credit of these documents as trustworthy rest=
s chiefly on the circumstance that miracles are conspicuously absent. Mr. H=

assing through the Forum Bovis, the Forum Amastrianorum, and the Forum Taur=

m it passed through the Forum of Constantine in which stood the Pillar of C=
onstantine (and the Churches of S. Constantine and S. Mary of the Forum). I=
n the Augusteum (which we might translate Place Imp=C3=A9riale) it came to =
an end, in front of the Senate house (=CE=A3=CE=B5=CE=BD=CE=AC=CF=84=CE=BF=
=CE=BD) and west wall of the Palace. The Augusteum was bounded on the north=
 by St. Sophia; on the east, by Senate house and palace buildings; on the s=
outh, by the Palace (the great entrance gate, known as the Chalk=C3=AA, was=
 here) and the north side of the Hippodrome, beside which were the Baths of=
 Zeuxippus. There was no public way between the east side of the Hippodrome=
 and the Palace. According to Labarte, the Augusteum was enclosed by a wall=
, with gates, on the west side, running from south-west of St. Sophia to a =
point between the Palace and the Hippodrome; so that the entrance to the Hi=
ppodrome and the Zeuxippus would have been outside the Augusteum. The stree=
t connecting the Augusteum with the Forum of Constantine was called Middle =
St., =E2=80=94 =CE=9C=CE=AD=CF=83=CE=B7. The Chalkoprateia, and the Church =
of the Theotokos (Mother of God) in Chalkoprateia, were not in the Augusteu=

<h2 id=3D"lf0214-03_label_1021">5.: THE NEW MONARCHY =E2=80=94 (<span class=
=3D"ptr">C. XVII</span>.)</h2>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_555">All the main points in the new absolute monarc=
hy, founded by Diocletian and organised by Constantine, have been brought o=
ut in the brilliant description of Gibbon (ch. xvii.): the new organisation=
 of the provinces; the hierarchical administration; the separation of civil=
 from military functions; the abolition of the distinction between Italy an=
d the Provinces; the loss of her unique position by Rome, which is closely =
connected with the clearly pronounced tendency of the Empire to part into a=
n eastern and a western half. Anticipations of some of these results we hav=
e seen in the history of the third century. The formal oligarchy of Emperor=
 and Senate, in which the Senate had been gradually becoming more and more =
a silent partner, formally ceases; the distinction between senatorial and i=
mperial provinces vanishes, there are no senatorial provinces; and the <i>a=
erarium,</i> which had many years before lost its importance, is no longer =
a state treasury but merely a municipal chest. Externally the change from t=
he Principate to undisguised monarchy is indicated by the assumption of ori=
ental state by the emperor (here Aurelian had pointed the way). The thoroug=
h-going reformation of the military system, which was not fully understood =
till Mommsen=E2=80=99s recent investigation, demands a note to itself; and =
the new division of provinces another. To distinguish between the work of D=
iocletian and that of Constantine is in many cases impossible, and Gibbon d=
id not attempt it; it will be seen however in the two following appendices =
that some distinctions can be established. To Diocletian was due the separa=
tion of the civil and military authority (Lactant., de Mort. P., 7; Euseb.,=
 de Mart. Pal., 13). The dioceses and prefectures are an instructive, and I=
 think we may say, typical instance of the relation between the work of the=
 two great emperors. We know beyond question that the dioceses were institu=
ted by Diocletian (Lact., <i>ib.</i>), but it has been disputed whether the=
 prefectures were due to him or (so Zosimus) to Constantine. <span class=3D=
"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=
=3D"bracket">[</span>423<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> The latter =
view seems the more probable; but the quadruple division of the Empire betw=
een Diocletian, Maximian and the two C=C3=A6sars (implying four prefects; t=
here is distinct evidence that the C=C3=A6sar Constantius had a prefect) wa=
s the suggestion and anticipation of the three (sometimes four; after 395 <=
span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> four) prefectu=
res. Constantine abandoned the artificial, adoptive system of Diocletian fo=
r a dynastic principle, but he retained the geographical side of that syste=
m and stereotyped it in the prefectures.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_556">A few words may be said here on (<i>a</i>) the=
 new ceremonial, (<i>b</i>) the imperial titles, and (<i>c</i>) the consist=
orium.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_557">(<i>a</i>) For the adoration see Godefroy on C=
od. Theod., vol. ii. p. 83. Those who approached the Emperor bent the knee,=
 and drew the edge of his purple robe to their lips. The Emperor wore a rob=
e of silk, embroidered with gold, and adorned with gems (introduced by Aure=
lian); or the purple cloak of the military commander (first worn in <i>Rome=
</i> by Septimius Severus, and since then an imperial <i>insigne</i>). He a=
lso wore the diadem (perhaps first worn by Aurelian, see Victor, Epit. 35, =
5; but the novelty is also ascribed to Diocletian, and to Constantine). Con=
stantine introduced the gold band round the head, which was called <i>nimbu=
s</i> (cp. Eckhel, Doct. Num., 8, 79). The emperor is officially called <i>=
deus,</i> and the cult of the imperial majesty, which at an early time had =
made its way in the camp, is further developed; and, when a new Emperor is =
proclaimed, his bust crowned with laurel is carried round in procession in =
the provinces. See Schiller, ii. p. 33, 34.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_558">(<i>b</i>) The style of imperial titles which =
was usual in the latter part of the Principate was maintained until the tim=
e of Gratian. It was Imperator C=C3=A6sar pius (felix or) invictus Augustus=
 pontifex Maximus =E2=80=94 icus [Sarmaticus, &amp;c.] maximus trib. pot. [=
ii. &amp;c.] consul [ii. &amp;c.] imperator [ii. &amp;c.] pater patriae pro=
consul. [The order of imperator and consul is variable. The only change mad=
e was the substitution of maximus victor ac triumphator for invictus. Grati=
an dropped the title pontifex maximus, and the other titles were at the sam=
e time abandoned in favour of a shorter formula,</p>
<p class=3D"indent-center" id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_559">Dominus noster {pius f=
elix semper Augustus invictissimus princeps, &amp;c.</p>
<p class=3D"indent-no" id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_560">The chief reminiscence of =
the republican constitution of the principate, so carefully contrived by Au=
gustus, was the practice of numbering the years of a reign by the formula <=
i>trib. pot.,</i> which appears as late as Theodosius ii. (on coins, Eckhel=
, 8, 182). Dominus, which (like deus) Aurelian had only used in the dative =
case, is from Constantine forward the ordinary official title of the Empero=
r (equivalent of =E2=80=9CHis Majesty=E2=80=9D). Schiller, ii. 31-33.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_561">(<i>c</i>) The consilium, which had been organ=
ised by Hadrian, is superseded in the new monarchy by a council called <i>c=
onsistorium</i> (the name first occurs in an inscription of 353 <span class=
=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span>,</span> C.I.L. 6, 1739), which =
assembled at fixed times in the Emperor=E2=80=99s presence. The chief of th=
e Hadrianic consilium was the pr=C3=A6torian prefect; but, as that officer =
has been diverted to new administrative functions and as the provincial adm=
inistration and palace offices are kept carefully apart, his position in th=
e council is inherited by the qu=C3=A6stor sacri pal. who presides over the=
 consistorium. It is however unlikely that the qu=C3=A6stor had this positi=
on at first under Diocletian and Constantine; for he does not belong to the=
 class of illustres till after Valentinian I. It has been conjectured (by M=
ommsen) that the president of the council was at first entitled <i>pr=C3=A6=
positus</i> and afterwards developed into the qu=C3=A6stor, and that he had=
 a deputy, the <i>vicarius a sacris consiliis,</i> who developed into the <=
i>magister officiorum</i> (Schiller, ii. 66). The members of the council (e=
ntitled at first <i>a consiliis sacris,</i> afterwards <i>comites consistor=
iani</i>) were divided into two <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoratio=
n">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>424<span =
class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> classes with a difference of stipend: <i>=
ducenarii</i> (200,000 sesterces), <i>sexagenarii</i> (60,000 sesterces), a=
nd mainly consisted of jurists. The functions of the council were properly =
confined to judicature, but they also assisted the Emperor in legislation. =
The two finance ministers belonged to the council, and in later times pr=C3=
=A6torian prefects and masters of soldiers were sometimes invited by the Em=
peror, but did not belong to the consistory ex officio. See on the subject,=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_562">Diocletian made considerable modifications in =
the provincial divisions of the Empire, and distributed all the provinces u=
nder twelve large Dioceses. Three changes in his diocesan arrangement were =
made in the course of the fourth century, and by 400 <span class=3D"sc"><sp=
an class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> we find thirteen Dioceses. (<i>a</i=

to be a separate Diocese towards the end of the fourth century. (<i>b</i>) =
Di=C5=93cesis Moesiarum was broken up into Di=C5=93cesis Daciae and Di=C5=
=93cesis Macedoniae. (<i>c</i>) On the other hand, Di=C5=93cesis Galliarum =
and Di=C5=93cesis Viennensis were combined to form a single Diocese of Gaul=
. In the case of this change we find an interesting example of the survival=
 of nomenclatures which had ceased to be appropriate. The south of Gaul was=
 at first divided into five provinces (Novempopuli, Aquitanica, Narbonensis=
, Viennensis, Alpes Maritimiae). But when these became seven by the subdivi=
sion of Aquitanica and Narbonensis the Diocese (Viennensis) still continued=
 to be known as Quinque Provinciae as well as by the amended title Septem P=
rovinciae. But this was not all. When Northern Gaul, the original Di=C5=93c=
esis Galliarum, was added to the sphere of the governor of the Di=C5=93cesi=
s Viennensis, the whole united Diocese was known not only as the Diocese of=
 the Gauls but as the Septem Provinciae; while the old name Quinque Provinc=
iae was appropriated to the seven southern provinces, which, though they we=
re no longer a separate Diocese, preserved a fragment of their former integ=
rity by having financial officers (<i>rationales</i>) to themselves.</p>

<h2 id=3D"lf0214-03_label_1058">7.: THE ORGANISATION OF THE ARMY UNDER THE =
NEW SYSTEM =E2=80=94 (<span class=3D"ptr">P. 136</span> <i>sqq.</i>)</h2>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_565">Mommsen has brought light and order into the s=
ubject of the new military organisation which was introduced in the epoch o=
f Diocletian and Constantine, by his article entitled Das r=C3=B6mische Mil=
it=C3=A4rwesen seit Diocletian, which appeared in Hermes in 1889 (vol. xxiv=
. p. 195 <i>sqq.</i>). The following brief account is based on this importa=
nt study.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_566">Under Diocletian the regular army seems to hav=
e fallen into two main divisions: the troops who followed the emperor as he=
 moved throughout his dominion, and the troops stationed on the frontier. T=
he latter were called <i>limitanei,</i> the former were possibly distinguis=
hed as <i>in sacro comitatu</i> (cp. C.I.L. 3, 6194). But early in Constant=
ine=E2=80=99s reign the troops <i>in sacro comitatu</i> were broken up into=
 two classes, the <i>comitatenses</i> and the <i>Palatini</i> (before 310, =
for the <i>comitatenses</i> existed then, cp. C.I.L. 5565; <i>palatini</i> =
occurs first in a law of 365 <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">a=
d</span>,</span> Cod. Theod. vii. 4, 22). Thus there were three great divis=
ions of the army: 1, (<i>a</i>) palatini, (<i>b</i>) comitatenses, and 2, l=
imitanei. Thus Gibbon=E2=80=99s use of <i>palatines</i> to include the <i>c=
omitatenses</i> is erroneous.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_567">The other most important changes introduced by=
 Constantine were: the increase of the comitatenses (who were under the com=
mand of the magister militum) at the expense of the limitanei, who had been=
 increased by Diocletian; and the separation of the cavalry from the infant=
ry.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_568">1. <i>Limitanei</i> (commanded by <i>duces</i>=
). The statement that Diocletian strengthened the frontier troops (Zos. ii.=
 34) is borne out by the fact that if we compare the list of the legions in=
 the time of Marcus (C.I.L. 6, 3492) with the Notitia Dignitatum, we find i=
n the former twenty-three legions, in the latter the same twenty-three and =
seventeen new legions (leaving out of account Britain, Germany, Africa, for=
 which we have not materials for comparison). And if we remember that Const=
antine drafted away regiments (the pseudo-comitatenses) to increase his com=
itatenses, we may conclude that Diocletian doubled the numbers of the front=
ier armies.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_569">The limitanei consisted of both infantry and c=
avalry. (1) The infantry consisted of <i>legiones, auxilia,</i> and <i>coho=
rtes.</i> (<i>a</i>) The legions are of two kinds. The old legions of the P=
rincipate retain their old strength of 6000 men; while the new legions corr=
espond to the old legionary detachments, and are probably 1000 strong. But =
the larger legions are usually broken into detachments which are distribute=
d in different places, and the pr=C3=A6fectus legionis consequently disappe=
ars. (<i>b</i>) The <i>auxilia</i> are of barbarian formation, and as such =
are thought more highly of than the rest of the frontier infantry; they are=
 found only in the Illyric provinces. The size of the <i>auxilium</i> is pr=
obably 500. (<i>c</i>) The <i>cohortes,</i> 500 strong as under the Princip=
ate, are found everywhere except in the duchies on the Lower Danube. (2) Th=
e (<i>a</i>) <i>cunei equitum</i> probably differ from (<i>b</i>) <i>equite=
s,</i> by being of barbarian formation and of higher rank. The (<i>c</i>) <=
i>ala</i> is generally 600 (not as before 500) strong.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_570">Constantine=E2=80=99s new organisation reduced=
 the limitanei to second-class troops, as compared with the imperial troops=
 of both kinds.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_571">2. Imperial Troops. (<i>a</i>) Comitatenses (u=
nder Masters of Soldiers) consist of infantry and cavalry: (=CE=B1) The leg=
ion is of the smaller size, about 1000 strong; (=CE=B2) the <i>vexillatio</=
i> of horse is about 500 strong. Connected with the comitatenses but of low=
er rank are the <i>pseudo-comitatenses,</i> drawn from the frontiers (eight=
een legions in the west, twenty in the east). (<i>b</i>) Palatini (under Ma=
sters of Soldiers <i>in pr=C3=A6senti</i>) consist of infantry and cavalry:=
 (=CE=B1) the legion of 1000; (=CE=B2) the <i>vexillatio</i> of 500.</p>
<span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </spa=
n><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>433<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span=
>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_572">In connection with the Palatini, the <i>auxili=
a palatina</i> demand notice. These are troops of light infantry, higher in=
 rank than the legion of the <i>comitatenses,</i> lower than the <i>palatin=
e</i> legion. They chiefly consist of Gauls and include Germans from beyond=
 the Rhine (but virtually no orientals). Mommsen makes it probable that the=
ir formation was mainly the work of Maximian (p. 233). They were perhaps th=
e most important troops in the army.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_573">The <i>scholae,</i> which seem to have been in=
stituted by Constantine, must also be mentioned here (cp. Cod. Theod. 14, 1=
7, 9). They were probably so called from having a hall in the palace to awa=
it orders. At first they were composed of Germans (but in fifth century und=
er Leo I., of Armenians; under Zeno, of Isaurians; afterwards of the best m=
en who could be got, Procop., Hist. Arc. c. 24). There were at first five d=
ivisions of 500 men; then seven; finally under Justinian eleven. The divisi=
on was commanded by a tribune, who was a person of much importance (<i>e.g.=
,</i> Valentinian I.). They ultimately lost their military character, and t=
he excubitores (first introduced by Leo I.) took their place.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_574">Gibbon considers the question of the size of t=
he army under the New Monarchy. On one side, we have the fact that under Se=
verus at the beginning of the third century there were thirty-three legions=
, which, reckoned, along with their adjuncts, at the usual strength, give a=
s the total strength of the army about 300,000. On the other side we have t=
he statement of Agathias quoted by Gibbon, which puts the nominal strength =
of the army in the middle of the sixth century at 645,000. Taking into acco=
unt the great increase of the troops under Diocletian, the record that the =
army was further strengthened by Valentinian (cp. Amm. Marc., 30, 7, 6, Zos=
. 4, 12), and a statement of Themistius (Or. 18, p. 270) as to the strength=
 of the frontier forces under Theodosius the Great, we might guess that at =
the beginning of the fifth century, when the Notitia was drawn up, the army=
 numbered five, if not six, hundred thousand. These <i>a priori</i> conside=
rations correspond satisfactorily with the rough calculation which Mommsen =
has ventured to make from the data of the Notitia. His figures deserve to b=
e noted, though he cautions us that we must not build on them.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_575">A word must be said about the <i>gentes,</i> w=
ho, outside the Roman provinces and formally independent, but within the Ro=
man sphere of influence and virtually dependent on the Empire, helped to pr=
otect the frontiers and sometimes supplied auxiliary troops to the Roman ar=
my. (Thus in Amm. xxiii. 2, 1, we read of <i>legationes gentium plurimarum =
auxilia pollicentium;</i> Julian refuses such <i>adventicia adiumenta.</i>)=
 The most important of these <i>gentes</i> are the Saracens on the borders =
of Syria, and the Goths on the right bank of the Danube. They are <i>f=C3=
=A6derati;</i> and their relation to the Empire depends on a <i>f=C3=A6dus<=
/i> which determines the services they are bound to perform. Under the Prin=
cipate the theory was that such <i>f=C3=A6derati</i> were tributaries, but =
in return for their military services the tribute was either remitted or di=
minished. But under the new system, they are considered rather in the light=
 of a frontier force and, like the regular riparienses, are paid for their =
work. Consequently the amount of the <i>annon=C3=A6 f=C3=A6deratic=C3=A6</i=
> is the chief question to be arranged in a <i>f=C3=A6dus.</i> The Lazi of =
Colchis were an exception to this rule; <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"d=
ecoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>4=
34<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> though federates they received no=
 annon=C3=A6 (Procop., B. P. 2, 15). The inclusion of the federates in the =
Empire is illustrated by the treaty with Persia in 532 <span class=3D"sc"><=
span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span>,</span> in which the Saracens are includ=
ed as a matter of course, without special mention (Procop., B. P. 1, 17; 2,=
 1). See Mommsen, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 215 <i>sqq.</i></p>

pan class=3D"ptr">P. 150</span>)</h2>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_576">The origin and organisation of the imperial gu=
ards, named Protectores and Domestici, who so often meet us in our historic=
al authorities from the time of Constantine forward, have been eludicated, =
so far as the scanty material allows, by Mommsen in a paper entitled Protec=
tores Augusti, in the Ephemeris Epigraphica, v. p. 121 <i>sqq.</i></p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_577">In the second half of the third century there =
existed protectores of two kinds: protectores Augusti, and protectores of t=
he pr=C3=A6torian prefect. The latter (whose existence is proved by epigrap=
hic evidence, cp. C.I.L. vi. 3238) naturally ceased when, under Constantine=
=E2=80=99s new <i>r=C3=A9gime,</i> the pr=C3=A6torian prefect ceased to hav=
e military functions.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_578">The earliest instance of a protector Augusti w=
hose date we can control is that of Taurus, who was consul in 261 <span cla=
ss=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span>,</span> and held the office o=
f pr=C3=A6torian prefect. An inscription (whose date must fall between 261 =
and 267 <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span>,</span> Orel=
li, 3100) mentions that he had been a protector Augusti. Mommsen calculates=
 that he must have held that post before 253 <span class=3D"sc"><span class=
=3D"entity ad">ad</span>,</span> and infers that protectors were instituted=
 about the middle of the century, by Decius or possibly Philip. The full ti=
tle of the protector was <i>protector divini lateris Augusti nostri,</i> pr=
eserved in one inscription found at Ocricul=C3=A6 (Orelli, 1869); for this =
form cp. Cod. Theod. vi. 24, 9. The abbreviation <i>protector Augusti</i> i=
s the regular formula up to Diocletian; after Diocletian it is simply <i>pr=
otector.</i></p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_579">The protectors were soldiers who had shown spe=
cial competence in their service, and were rewarded by a post in which they=
 received higher pay (they were called <i>ducenarii</i> from the amount of =
their salary) and had the expectation of being advanced to higher military =
commands. Gallienus hindered Senators from serving as officers in the army,=
 and from that time the service of the protectors became a sort of military=
 training school (Mommsen, l. c. p. 137) to supply commanders (<i>ad regend=
os milites,</i> Ammianus). From Aurelian=E2=80=99s time (<i>ib.</i> 131) th=
e protectors seem to have been organised as a bodyguard of the Emperor, wit=
h a captain of their own. (The earliest mention of the service in legislati=
on is in a law of 325 <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span=
>,</span> Cod. Th. vii. 20, 4.);</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_580">Constantine completely abolished the pr=C3=A6t=
orian and the military functions of the praef. praet. With this change we m=
ust connect his reorganisation of the protectores (<i>ib.</i> 135). The nat=
ure of this reorganisation was determined by his abrogation of the measure =
of Gallienus which excluded senators from military command. A body of guard=
s was instituted, called Domestici or Houseguards, which was designed to ad=
mit nobles and sons of senators to a career in the army. Thus there were no=
w two corps of palace guards, that of the Protectors who were enrolled for =
distinguished service, and were consequently veterans, and that of the Dome=
stics who were admitted <i>nobilitate et gratia,</i> through birth and inte=
rest. But the two were closely connected and jointly commanded by captains =
called Counts of the Domestics; and the two names came to be interchangeabl=
e and used indifferently of one or the other.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_581">It cannot indeed be strictly demonstrated that=
 Constantine organised the Domestics, who are first mentioned in a law of 3=
46 <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> (Cod. Th. =
xii. 1, 38); but this hypothesis is far more likely than any other. At the =
same time the pay of the guards was probably increased =E2=80=94 a necessar=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_582">By a law of Valentinian (Cod. Th. vi. 24, 2) v=
eterans were enrolled in the guards gratis, while all others had to pay. Th=
e ultimate result was that veterans ceased to be enrolled altogether, and t=

=80=94 (<span class=3D"ptr">P. 175</span> <i>sqq.</i>)</h2>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_583">The attempt of Gibbon to show that Fausta was =
not put to death by Constantine was unsuccessful; for the text on which he =
chiefly relied has nothing to do with Constantine the Great, but refers to =
an Emperor of the fifteenth century (see above, vol. ii. App. 10, p. 360); =
and from the subsidiary passage in Julian (p. 211, n. 25) no inference can =
be drawn. On the other hand, as Seeck has pointed out, the sign of the Cons=
tantinople mint appears on coins of Constantine I. and II., Constantius, Co=
nstans, Helena, Theodore, Delmatius and Hannibalianus, in short all the mem=
bers of the imperial family who survived the foundation of the Capital (11t=
h May, 330); but in the Fausta series as in the Crispus series the sign nev=
er appears, and in the Trier mint the latest coins of both belong to the sa=
me emission. Eusebius, the writer of the Anonymous Valesian fragment, and A=
urelius Victor are silent as to the death of Fausta; but this proves nothin=
g, on the principle, as Seeck observes, =E2=80=9Cim Hause des Gehenkten red=
et man nicht vom Stricke.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_584">The evidence as to the circumstances of the tr=
agedy is investigated in a suggestive manner by Seeck, =E2=80=9CDie Verwand=
tenmorde Constantins des Grossen,=E2=80=9D in Ztsch. f. wiss. Theol. 33, 18=
90, p. 63 <i>sqq.</i> He distinguishes four independent testimonies. (1) Eu=
tropius (on whom Jerome and Orosius depend) states simply that Constantine =
put to death his son and wife. (2) Sidonius Apollinaris mentions (Ep. v. 8)=
 that Crispus was poisoned, Fausta suffocated by a hot bath. These kinds of=
 death were suitable to avoid the appearance of violence. (3) Philostorgius=
 (ii. 4) assigns causes. He says that Crispus, calumniated by Fausta, was p=
ut to death, and that she was afterwards found guilty of adultery with a cu=
rsor and killed in a hot bath. (4) A common source, on which the Epitome of=
 Victor, the account of Zosimus, and that of John the Monk in the Vita S. A=
rtemii (Acta Sanct. 8th October) depend, stated that Fausta charged Crispus=
 with having offered her violence; Crispus was therefore executed; then Hel=
ena persuaded Constantine that Fausta was the guilty one, and induced him t=
o kill her by an overheated bath. Then Constantine repents; the heathen pri=
ests declared that his deeds could not be expiated; Christianity offered fo=
rgiveness and he became a Christian. Seeck points out that this unknown sou=
rce agrees with Philostorgius in three points: the manner of Fausta=E2=80=
=99s death; her guilt in causing the death of Crispus; her connection with =
a story of adultery. In the details (which Gibbon, p. 178-180, combines) th=
ey differ.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_585">Seeck argues for the view that the drama of Fa=
usta and Crispus was a renewal of that of Ph=C3=A6dra and Hippolytus. It is=

various difficulties, from the circumstance that the statements of our best=
 authorities are not sufficiently precise, and those of secondary authoriti=

not been sufficiently considered. Later writers were accustomed to certain =
stereotyped lines of division which had been fixed by the partitions of <sp=
an class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> (364 and) 395; a=
nd they were determined by these in interpreting the geographical phrases o=
f earlier writers. It is therefore especially important in this case to con=
sider the testimonies of the earlier writers apart from later exegesis. It =
is also clear that names like Illyricum (which came to be distinguished int=
o the diocese [Western] and the prefecture [Eastern]), Thrace (which might =
mean either the diocese or the province, or might bear, as in Anon. Val., i=
ts old sense, covering the four provinces south of Mount Haemus), Gaul (whi=
ch might include Spain and Britain), were very likely to mislead into false=
 and various explanations.</p>

easily arise from the inclusion (under Constantine) of Spain in the Prefect=

 the same assignment of Asia is repeated (on the same authority) at the lat=
er division of 315. It is at least not contradicted by the not precise stat=
ement of Aur. Victor (<i>ib.</i>): Illyrica ora adusque Ponti fretum Galeri=
o; cetera Valerius retentavit. Later writers, accustomed to the later divis=
ion of the Prefectures of Illyricum and the East, could hardly realise this=
 cross division; the utmost their imaginations could compass would be to co=
nnect Thrace with Illyricum instead of Asia Minor. That the statesmen of Di=
ocletian=E2=80=99s age did not regard the Propontis as a necessary geograph=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_598">The question is, what were the limits of the p=
rovince of Delmatius? Is ripa Gothica [I have not seen noticed a parallel e=
xpression in De Mortibus, 17, where Galerius reaches Nicomedia, <i>per circ=
uitum rip=C3=A6 strig=C3=A6,</i> where the emendation <i>Istric=C3=A6</i> i=
s doubtless right] to be interpreted as Eastern Illyricum (=3D dioceses of =
Dacia, Macedonia, and Thrace)? So Schiller (ii. 235), Ranke, Burckhardt, an=
d others. But the Epitome of Victor (41, 20) includes in the share of Const=
ans =E2=80=9CDalmatia, Thrace, Macedonia, and Achaia.=E2=80=9D Ranke suppos=
es that <i>Dalmatiam</i> here is a scribe=E2=80=99s mistake for <i>Dalmatiu=
s,</i> and that we should interpret the <i>ripa Gothica</i> of the Anonymou=
s by the words thus amended. If we adopted this view, it would be better to=
 read: Dalmaci &lt;;us Daci=3D;am Thraciam Macedoniam Achaiamque.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_599">But a view that necessitates tampering with a =
text which in itself gives perfect sense cannot be accepted as satisfactory=
. There is a further objection here. The text of the Epitome agrees remarka=
bly with the statement of Zonaras, xiii. 5, which assigns to Constans Italy=
, Africa, Sicily and the islands, Illyricum, Macedonia, =E2=80=9CAchaia, wi=
th the Peloponnesus.=E2=80=9D The Epitome was not a direct source of Zonara=
s; but the agreement is explained by the fact that both (the author of the =
Epitome directly, Zonaras indirectly) drew from a common source (probably A=
mmianus: cp. L. Jeep, Quellenunt. zu den gr. Kirchenhistorikern, p. 67). Th=
us the assumption of a textual error in the Epitome means the assumption of=
 an error in the text of an earlier authority; and therefore becomes decide=
dly hazardous and unconvincing. Add to this that the interpretation of <i>r=
ipa Gothica</i> to include or to imply Macedonia and Greece is extremely fo=
rced. The natural meaning of the expression is: the provinces of Dacia, Moe=
sia I. and II. and Scythia and perhaps Pannonia and Noricum. The actual tes=
timonies of the two best authorities, that are explicit, concur in showing =
that the main division of <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</=

 largely used, and consequently the Life of Artemius becomes an important m=

, Pers. i. 5), probably in first years of King Vram =C5=A0apuh, who reigned=
 from 395 to 416 (Gelzer, p. 116). The work is marked by enthusiasm for the=
 clergy, and a certain prejudice against the policy of those who were loyal=
 to the kings; also by chronological errors. =E2=80=9CFaustus is completely=
 a national Armenian; therein lies his strength and his weakness=E2=80=9D (=
<i>ib.</i> 117). He consulted official documents in the royal archives (<i>=
ib.</i>) and made use of old songs. It is announced that H. Gelzer and L. B=
abajan will issue a translation of Faustus, and Gelzer=E2=80=99s name is a =

bout half a century later, contains a work which is our only good source fo=

ranslation, which mutually check each other) has been dissected by A. von G=
utschmid (Kleine Schriften, 3, 395, <i>sqq.</i>). It contains an earlier Li=

date of Moses of Chorene is very late (beginning of eighth century) is acce=
pted by Chalatianz and Gelzer, and seems to be established. (<i>d</i>) The =
worthlessness of the History of Taron by Zenob of Glak has been shown by th=
e investigation of Chalatianz (<i>op. cit.</i>). Hitherto supposed to have =
been written in Syriac in the fourth century and translated into Armenian i=

 and then the priests of Valar=C5=A1apat invented stories to prove the anti=
quity of their seat and the original independence of the Armenian Church. I=
n the fourth century, the chief feature of the domestic history of Armenia =
is the struggle between the monarch and the Catholicus, between the spirit =
of nationality and the subjection to foreign influences. It culminated in t=
he reign of Pap, who solved the question by poison.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_621">In regard to the conversion of Armenia, its pr=
ogress was partly determined by the feudal condition of the country (Gelzer=

seems to have been slow in taking root among the people, and it is notewort=

(in Langlois, under the title, Mar Apas Catina). Moses also used the origin=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_623">The attitude of Constantine to the Christian r=
eligion has been the theme of many discussions, and historians are still fa=
r from having reached a general agreement. Burckhardt, in his attractive mo=
nograph, developed the view that Constantine was =E2=80=9Cganz wesentlich u=
nreligi=C3=B6s,=E2=80=9D constitutionally indifferent to religion, because =
he was a =E2=80=9Cgenialer Mensch,=E2=80=9D dominated by ambition; and that=
 in his later years he exhibited personal inclinations rather towards pagan=
ism than towards Christianity. H. Richter has some remarkable pages on Cons=
tantine=E2=80=99s <i>system of parity</i> between the two religions; and Br=
ieger, in an excellent article in his <i>Zeitschrift j. Kirchengesch.</i> (=
iv., 1881, p. 163 <i>sqq.</i>), agrees with Gibbon that Constantine=E2=80=
=99s Christianity was due entirely to political considerations. Many of the=
 data admit of different interpretations. Those who ascribe to him a policy=
 of parity, or the idea of a state religion which might combine elements co=
mmon to enlightened paganism and Christianity (so Schiller), appeal to the =
fact that the <i>sacerdotales</i> and <i>flamines</i> in Africa were grante=
d privileges; but it is replied that they had ceased to carry on the ritual=
 and simply, as a matter of equity, had the old rights secured to them, whi=
le they no longer performed the old duties. If the =E2=80=9Ccult=E2=80=9D o=
f Tyche at Constantinople is alleged, it is urged that she had no temple-se=
rvice. The temples of Constantinople are explained away; and the =E2=80=9Ca=

otnote">1</a> (See V. Schultze, in Brieger=E2=80=99s <i>Zeitschrift,</i> vi=
i. 352 <i>sqq.</i>) The indulgence to paganism was simply the toleration of=
 a statesman who could not discreetly go too fast in the accomplishment of =
such a great reformation. And certainly on the hypothesis that Constantine =
had before his eyes, as the thing to be achieved, the ultimate establishmen=
t of Christianity as the exclusive state religion, his attitude to paganism=
 would be, in general, the attitude we should expect from a really great st=
atesman. Ranke=E2=80=99s remark hits the point (Weltgesch. iii. 1, 532): =
=E2=80=9CEr konnte unm=C3=B6glich zugeben dass an die Stelle der Unordnunge=
n der Verfolgung die vielleicht noch grosseren einer gewaltsamen Reaction t=
r=C3=A4ten.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_624">It seems to me that Seeck, in holding that Con=
stantine had really broken with the old religion and was frankly a Christia=
n, is nearer the mark than Gibbon or Schiller. From the evidence which we h=
ave, I believe that Constantine adopted the Christian religion and intended=
 that Christianity should be the State religion. As to a great many details=
, there may be uncertainty in regard to the facts themselves or their inter=
pretation, but I would invite attention to the following general considerat=
ions.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_625">(1) The theory that the motives of Constantine=
=E2=80=99s Christian policy were purely political, and that he was religiou=
sly indifferent, seems perilously like an anachronism, =E2=80=94 ascribing =
to him modern ideas. There is no reason to suppose that he was above the su=
perstitiousness of his age. (2) The theory that he was a Deist, that he des=
ired to put Paganism and Christianity on an equality, emphasising some comm=
on features, and that circumstances led him to incline the balance towards =
Christianity in his later years, is not the view <i>naturally</i> suggested=
 by the (<i>a</i>) Christian education he gave his children, and (<i>b</i>)=
 the hostility of the pagan Emperor Julian to his memory. (3) The fact that=
 he countenanced Paganism and did not completely abolish the customs of the=
 old State religion proves nothing; the remark of Ranke quoted above is a s=
ufficient answer. In fact, those who have dealt with the question have some=
times failed to distinguish between two different things. It is one thing t=
o say that Constantine=E2=80=99s motives for establishing Christianity were=
 purely secular. It is quite another to say that he was guided by secular c=
onsiderations in the methods which he adopted to establish Christianity. Th=
e second thesis is true =E2=80=94 Constantine would have been a bad statesm=
an if he had not been so guided; =E2=80=94 but its truth is quite consisten=
t with the falsity of the first.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_626">Schiller (iii. 301 <i>sqq.</i>) has convenient=
ly summarised the chief facts, and his results may be arranged as follows: =
=E2=80=94</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_627">(1) <span class=3D"csc">Coins.</span> In Const=
antine=E2=80=99s western mints coins appeared with <i>Mars,</i> with <i>gen=
ius pop. Rom.,</i> and with <i>Sol,</i> but certainly not in the two first =
cases, perhaps not in the last case, after 315 <span class=3D"sc"><span cla=
ss=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> Further, Constantinian coins with <i>Jupp=
iter</i> were not struck in the west, but in the mints of Licinius. Thus we=
 may say that between 315 and 323 pagan emblems were disappearing from Cons=
tantine=E2=80=99s coinage, and indifferent legends took their place, such a=
s <i>Beata tranquillitas.</i></p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_628">We also find coins with [Editor: see p. 444 of=
 the PDF for this image], as a sign of the mint; and at the end of Constant=
ine=E2=80=99s reign a series of copper coins was issued in which two soldie=
rs were represented on the reverse holding the labarum, that is a flag with=
 the monogram [Editor: see p. 444 of the PDF for this image].</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_629">We see then two stages in Constantine=E2=80=99=
s policy. At first he removes from <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decora=
tion">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>445<sp=
an class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> his coins symbols which might offend h=
is Christian soldiers and subjects whom he wished to propitiate (this is Sc=
hiller=E2=80=99s interpretation); and finally he allows to appear on his mo=
ney symbols which did not indeed commit him to Christianity, but were susce=
ptible of a Christian meaning.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_630">(2) <span class=3D"csc">Laws.</span> After the=
 great Edict of Milan, 312-3 <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">a=
d</span></span> (which, according to Seeck, was never issued), the followin=
g measures were taken by Constantine to put Christianity on a level with th=
e old religion. (1) 313 <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</sp=
an>,</span> the Catholic clergy were freed from all state burdens. (2) 313 =
(or 315), the Church was freed from <i>annona</i> and <i>tributum.</i> (3) =
316 (321), Manumissions in the Church were made valid. (4) 319, (1) was ext=
ended to the whole empire. (5) 320, exception to the laws against celibacy =
made in favour of the clergy, allowing them to inherit. (6) 321, wills in f=
avour of the Catholic Church permitted. (7) 323, forcing of Christians to t=
ake part in pagan celebrations forbidden. On the other hand, a law of 321 (=
Cod. Theod. xvi. 10, 1) forbids private consultation of haruspices, but all=
ows it in public. [Cp. further Seuffert, Constantins Gesetze und das Christ=
enthum, 1891.]</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_631">(3) <span class=3D"csc">Eusebius</span> descri=
bes in his Ecclesiastical History (bk. x. 1 <i>sqq.</i>) a number of acts o=
f Constantine after his victory over Maxentius, which attest not only toler=
ation but decided favour towards the Christians. He entertains Christian pr=
iests, heaps presents on the Church, takes an interest in ecclesiastical qu=
estions. There is no reason to doubt these statements; but Schiller urges u=
s to remember (1) that Eusebius does not mention what favour Constantine be=
stowed on the pagans, and (2) that, when the final struggle with Licinius c=
ame and that Emperor resorted to persecution, policy clearly dictated to Co=
nstantine the expediency of specially favouring Christianity. In general, a=
ccording to Schiller, from 313 to 323 Constantine not only maintained impar=
tial toleration, but bestowed positive benefits on both the old and the new=
 religion. The account of Eusebius is a misrepresentation through omission =
of the other side.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_632">One or two points may be added. Eusebius state=
s that after the victory over Maxentius Constantine erected a statue of him=
self with a cross in his right hand at Rome. This statement occurs in Hist.=
 E. ix. c. 10, 11; Paneg. ix. 18; Vit. C. i. 40. Is this to be accepted as =
a fact? A statement in H. E. is more trustworthy than any statement in the =
Vit. C.; and Brieger thought that in this case the passage in H. E. is an i=
nterpolation from that in the Vit. C. (Ztsch. f. Kirchengesch. 1880, p. 45)=
. But Schultze (<i>ib.</i> vii. 1885, 343 <i>sqq.</i>) has shown that Euseb=
ius mentioned the statue in question, in his speech at Tyre in 314 <span cl=
ass=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span>,</span> from H. E. x. 4, 16.=
 This adds considerable weight to the evidence.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_633">In regard to the monogram [Editor: see p. 444 =
of the PDF for this image], Rapp in his paper, Das Labarum und der Sonnenku=
ltus (Jahrb. des Vereins von Altertumsfreunden im Rheinlande, 1866, p. 116 =
<i>sqq.</i>), showed that it appears on Greco-Bactrian coins of 2nd and 1st=
 centuries <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity bc">bc</span></span> It=
 appears still earlier on Tarentine coins of the first half of the 3rd cent=
ury. It is not clear that Constantine used it as an ambiguous symbol; nor y=
et is there a well-attested instance of its use as a Christian symbol befor=
e <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 323 (cp. Br=
ieger in his Ztschr. iv. 1881, p. 201).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_634">Several examples of the Labarum as described b=
y Eusebius are preserved; I may refer especially to one on a Roman sarcopha=
gus in the Lateran Museum.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_635">For =E2=80=9CChristian emblems on the coins of=
 Constantine the Great, his family and his successors,=E2=80=9D see Madden =
in the Numismatic Chronicle, 1877-8.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_636">For the Tyche, to whom Constantine dedicated h=
is new city, the most recent and instructive study is the brief paper of St=
rzygovski, in Analecta Gr=C3=A6ciensia (Graz, 1893).</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-03_637">As to the connection of Constantine with the D=
onatist controversy, attention may be drawn to the article of O. Seeck in B=
rieger=E2=80=99s Zeitsch. f. Kirchengeschichte, x. 505-568 (Quellen und Urk=
unden =C3=BCber die Anfange des Donatismus). He fixes the date of the Counc=
il of Arles to <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span=
> 316 (cp. Euseb. V. C. i. 44-45). The general result of his discussion is =
to discredit the authority of Optatus, whom he regards as a liar, drawing f=
rom a lying source. The only value of the work of Optatus is to be found, h=
e concludes, in the parts which rest on the protocols of the Synods of Cirt=
a and Rome, and the lost parts of the Acta of the process of Felix (<i>viz.=
,</i> I., 13, 14, 23, 24, 27, and perhaps the story of the choice of C=C3=
=A6cilian, 16-18).</p>

ly becomes more cautious and moderate. Instead of a large, but definite num=

 what he had seen or what he had heard; either the expectation or the execu=

 their piety would induce them to prefer the most favourable sense. There w=

till exercised that great office, he was created, in the year 399, consul f=

unuch Eutropius, often stands alone in the Fasti. 9. In the year 408, Malli=
us was appointed a second time Pr=C3=A6torian prefect of Italy. Even in the=
 venal panegyric of Claudian, we may discover the merit of Mallius Theodoru=

f St. Augustin. See Tillemont, Hist. des Emp. tom. v. p. 1110-1114. [Inscri=

 See l=E2=80=99Art de v=C3=A9rifier les Dates, p. xi.; and Dictionnaire Rai=
son. de la Diplomatique, tom. ii. p. 25; two accurate treatises, which come=
 from the workshop of the Benedictines. [A fifteen-yearly valuation of prop=
erty, for purposes of taxation, was as old as Hadrian (Mommsen, Staatsrecht=
, ii. 975). The financial year or =E2=80=9Cindiction=E2=80=9D ran from 1st =
Sept. to 31st Aug., and thus included unequal parts of two calendar years; =
as a mode of chronology, it came into general use in the course of the fift=

d">ad</span></span> was regarded as the first year of the first fifteen-yea=
r cycle. Accordingly, if we wish to determine the indiction corresponding t=
o any year, we subtract 312 and divide the difference by 15; the remainder =
is the indiction to which the first eight months of the given year (and the=
 last four of the preceding year) belong. Take 700 <span class=3D"sc"><span=

der, the indiction is 15.) It is clear that the converse process requires a=
 knowledge of the approximate period in terms of Anni Domini. Thus, if we k=
now the date of the reign of Justinian ii., we may determine the indiction,=
 say, of the first year in that reign, and so reckon which year corresponds=
 to Ind. 13. =E2=80=94 In the twelfth century this usage changed; the perio=
d of fifteen years was called the indiction; and the Birth of Christ was ad=
opted as the starting-point. A year was known as the first, second, &amp;c.=

hat in Egypt (under the empire) the indictional year did not begin on 1st S=

om. vi. p. 116) argues with weight and learning on the subject of the capit=
ation; but, while he explains the <i>caput</i> as a share or measure of pro=
perty, he too absolutely excludes the idea of a personal assessment. [The o=
ld land tax or <i>tributum</i> (so called in imperial provinces; <i>stipend=
ium</i> in senatorial) now became the <i>capitatio terrena</i> (or <i>iugat=
io</i>), and the assessment was made on a valuation, not of the produce, bu=
t of the capital. In the Eastern part of the empire, property was divided i=
nto a number of unities which paid the same tax, and consequently differed =
in size according to the value of the land. (Seven classes of land were dis=
tinguished: 1, wine-producing; 2, 3, oil-producing; 4, 5, 6, arable; 7, pas=
ture.) The unity or <i>iugum</i> was valued at 1000 solidi, and might be ma=
de up of land of different classes. Under Diocletian this tax was paid in k=
ind, though assessed in money (<i>annonae,</i> measures of corn, and <i>cap=
ita,</i> units of hay, &amp;c., being equated with money-values), but after=
 Constantine=E2=80=99s monetary reforms the payment could be made in coin. =
Landed proprietors had, besides this tax, to supply rations for the support=
 of the government officials and the army. The <i>cap. terrena</i> must be =
distinguished from the <i>cap. humana</i> or poll-tax, which is very obscur=
e, but possibly fell on the coloni, as it certainly did on widows and orpha=
ns (so Schiller). Compare Mommsen=E2=80=99s article in Hermes, 3, 429 <i>sq=

 the excellent discourse of Mr. Greaves on the Denarius for the proof of th=
e following principles: 1. That the ancient and modern Roman pound, contain=
ing 5256 grains of Troy weight, is about one-twelfth lighter than the Engli=
sh pound, which is composed of 5760 of the same grains. 2. That the pound o=
f gold, which had once been divided into forty-eight <i>aurei,</i> was at t=
his time coined into seventy-two smaller pieces of the same denomination. 3=
. That five of these aurei were the legal tender for a pound of silver, and=
 that consequently the pound of gold was exchanged for fourteen pounds eigh=
t ounces of silver according to the Roman, or about thirteen pounds accordi=
ng to the English, weight. 4. That the English pound of silver is coined in=
to sixty-two shillings. From these elements we may compute the Roman pound =
of gold, the usual method of reckoning large sums, at forty pounds sterling=
; and we may fix the currency of the <i>aureus</i> at somewhat more than el=
even shillings. [Before Diocletian 70 aurei were struck from a pound of gol=
d. Diocletian raised the value of the aureus from 1/70 to 1/60, and Constan=
tine reduced it again, but to 1/72. This new Constantinian aureus was also =
called <i>Solidus</i> (whence Ital. <i>soldo,</i> French <i>sou</i>). Schil=

(transl. by Sachau, 1879), written early in 11th cent. at Khiva, which pres=

ipated the use of <i>pagans</i> and paganism, I shall now trace the singula=
r revolutions of those celebrated words. 1. =CE=A0=CE=B1=CE=B3=CE=AE [=CF=
=80=CE=B1=CE=B3=CE=AC], in the Doric dialect, so familiar to the Italians, =
signifies a fountain; and the rural neighbourhood which frequented the same=
 fountain derived the common appellation of <i>pagus</i> and <i>pagans</i> =
(Festus sub voce, and Servius ad Virgil. Georgic. ii. 382). 2. By an easy e=
xtension of the word, <i>pagan</i> and rural became almost synonymous (Plin=
. Hist. Natur. xxviii. 5); and the meaner rustics acquired that name, which=
 has been corrupted into <i>peasants</i> in the modern languages of Europe.=
 3. The amazing increase of the military order introduced the necessity of =
a correlative term (Hume=E2=80=99s Essays, vol. i. p. 555); and all the <i>=
people</i> who were not enlisted in the service of the prince were branded =
with the contemptuous epithet of pagans (Tacit. Hist. iii. 24, 43, 77. Juve=
nal. Satir. xvi. [33]. Tertullian. de Pallio, c. 4). 4. The Christians were=
 the soldiers of Christ; their adversaries, who refused his <i>sacrament,</=
i> or military oath of baptism, might deserve the metaphorical name of paga=
ns: and this popular reproach was introduced as early as the reign of Valen=
tinian (<span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 365) =
into Imperial laws (Cod. Theodos. l. xvi. tit. ii. leg. 18) and theological=
 writings. 5. Christianity gradually filled the cities of the empire; the o=
ld religion, in the time of Prudentius (advers. Symmachum, l. i. ad fin.) a=
nd Orosius (in Pr=C3=A6fat. Hist.), retired and languished in obscure villa=
ges; and the word <i>pagans,</i> with its new signification, reverted to it=
s primitive origin. 6. Since the worship of Jupiter and his family has expi=
red, the vacant title of pagans has been successively applied to all the id=
olaters and polytheists of the old and new world. 7. The Latin Christians b=
estowed it, without scruple, on their mortal enemies the Mahometans; and th=
e purest <i>unitarians</i> were branded with the unjust reproach of idolatr=
y and paganism. See Gerard Vossius, Etymologicon Lingu=C3=A6 Latin=C3=A6, i=
n his works, tom. i. p. 420. Godefroy=E2=80=99s Commentary on the Theodosia=
n Code, tom. vi. p. 250, and Ducange, medi=C3=A6 et infim=C3=A6 Latinitat. =
Glossar. [Latin <i>pagus,</i> canton or village, has nothing to do with =CF=
=80=CE=B7=CE=B3=CE=AE.]</p></div>

e former expressed a likeness, an apparition (Homer, Odyss. xi. 601), a rep=
resentation, an <i>image,</i> created either by fancy or art. The latter de=
noted any sort of <i>service</i> or slavery. The Jews of Egypt, who transla=
ted the Hebrew scriptures, restrained the use of these words (Exodus xx. 4,=
 5) to the religious worship of an image. The peculiar idiom of the Helleni=
sts, or Grecian Jews, has been adopted by the sacred and ecclesiastical wri=
ters; and the reproach of <i>idolatry</i> (Εἰδωλολατρεία) has stigmatised that visi=
ble and abject mode of superstition which some sects of Christianity should=
 not hastily impute to the polytheists of Greece and Rome.</p></div>
