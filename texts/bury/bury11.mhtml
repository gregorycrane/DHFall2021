The six Venetians were the principal servants of the state, and in this lis=

 and, though he cautiously provided for the success of his arms, the droopi=

served by his arms; and the savage, with shame and loss, was compelled to r=

After discharging his debt by a fruitless assault, the emperor raised the s=

to the soil, without freedom, or property, or knowledge; and the two orders=

ldest sons, as a necessary precaution, were previously crowned during the l=
ifetime of their fathers. The peers of France have long maintained their pr=
ecedency before the younger branches of the royal line; nor had the princes=
 of the blood, in the twelfth century, acquired that hereditary lustre whic=
h is now diffused over the most remote candidates for the succession. 2. Th=
e barons of Courtenay must have stood high in their own estimation, and in =
that of the world, since they could impose on the son of a king the obligat=
ion of adopting for himself and all his descendants the name and arms of th=
eir daughter and his wife. In the marriage of an heiress with her inferior =
or her equal, such exchange was often required and allowed; but, as they co=
ntinued to diverge from the regal stem, the sons of Louis the Fat were inse=
nsibly confounded with their maternal ancestors; and the new Courtenays mig=
ht deserve to forfeit the honours of their birth, which a motive of interes=
t had tempted them to renounce. 3. The shame was far more permanent than th=
e reward, and a momentary blaze was followed by a long darkness. The eldest=
 son of these nuptials, Peter of Courtenay, had married, as I have already =
mentioned, the sister of the counts of Flanders, the two first emperors of =
Constantinople; he rashly accepted the invitation of the barons of Romania;=
 his two sons, Robert and Baldwin, successively held and lost the remains o=
f the Latin empire in the East, and the granddaughter of Baldwin the Second=
 again mingled her blood with the blood of France and of Valois. To support=
 the expenses of a troubled and transitory reign, their patrimonial estates=
 were mortgaged or sold; and the last emperors of Constantinople depended o=
n the annual charity of Rome and Naples.</p>

in the annals of the kingdom, must be painfully searched by the minute dili=

Edwards and Henries; their names are conspicuous in battles, in tournaments=

 conveyed into strange families by the marriages of his four aunts; and his=

rewarding merit was applied by every candidate to his own hopes. Conscious =

rienced guardian; of an associate raised above the envy of his equals, and =
invested with the name and prerogatives of royalty. For the interest of the=
 prince and people, without any views for himself or his family, the Great =
Duke consented to guard and instruct the son of Theodore; but he sighed for=
 the happy moment when he might restore to his firmer hands the administrat=
ion of his patrimony, and enjoy the blessings of a private station. He was =
first invested with the title and prerogatives of <i>despot</i>, which best=
owed the purple ornaments, and the second place in the Roman monarchy. It w=
as afterwards agreed that John and Michael should be proclaimed as joint em=
perors, and raised on the buckler, but that the pre-eminence should be rese=
rved for the birth-right of the former. A mutual league of amity was pledge=
d between the royal partners; and, in case of a rupture, the subjects were =
bound, by their oath of allegiance, to declare themselves against the aggre=
ssor: an ambiguous name, the seed of discord and civil war. Pal=C3=A6ologus=
 was content; but on the day of his coronation, and in the cathedral of Nic=
e, his zealous adherents most vehemently urged the just priority of his age=
 and merit. The unseasonable dispute was eluded by postponing to a more con=
venient opportunity the coronation of John Lascaris; and he walked with a s=
light diadem in the train of his guardian, who alone received the Imperial =
crown from the hands of the patriarch. It was not without extreme reluctanc=

shed their battle-axes; a sign of assent was extorted from the trembling yo=
uth; and some voices were heard, that the life of a child should no longer =
impede the settlement of the nation. A full harvest of honours and employme=

e Roman empire extended to the Adriatic, the Tigris, and the confines of Et=
hiopia. After the loss of the provinces, our capital itself, in these last =
and calamitous days, has been wrested from our hands by the Barbarians of t=
he West. From the lowest ebb, the tide of prosperity has again returned in =
our favour; but our prosperity was that of fugitives and exiles; and, when =
we were asked, Which was the country of the Romans? we indicated with a blu=
sh the climate of the globe and the quarter of the heavens. The Divine Prov=
idence has now restored to our arms the city of Constantine, the sacred sea=
t of religion and empire; and it will depend on our valour and conduct to r=
ender this important acquisition the pledge and omen of future victories.=
=E2=80=9D So eager was the impatience of the prince and people that Michael=
 made his triumphal entry into Constantinople only twenty days after the ex=
pulsion of the Latins. The golden gate was thrown open at his approach; the=
 devout conqueror dismounted from his horse; and a miraculous image of Mary=
, the Conductress, was borne before him, that the divine Virgin in person m=
ight appear to conduct him to the temple of her Son, the cathedral of St. S=
ophia. But, after the first transport of devotion and pride, he sighed at t=
he dreary prospect of solitude and ruin. The palace was defiled with smoke =
and dirt, and the gross intemperance of the Franks; whole streets had been =
consumed by fire, or were decayed by the injuries of time; the sacred and p=
rofane edifices were stripped of their ornaments; and, as if they were cons=
cious of their approaching exile, the industry of the Latins had been confi=
ned to the work of pillage and destruction. Trade had expired under the pre=
ssure of anarchy and distress; and the number of <span class=3D"pb"><span c=

 with the opulence of the city. It was the first care of the Greek monarch =
to reinstate the nobles in the palaces of their fathers; and the houses or =
the ground which they occupied were restored to the families that could exh=
ibit a legal right of inheritance. But the far greater part was extinct or =
lost; the vacant property had devolved to the lord; he repeopled Constantin=
ople by a liberal invitation to the provinces; and the brave <i>volunteers<=

French barons and the principal families had retired with their emperor; bu=

s maxims of ancient Rome; nor did they presume to enforce their censures, b=

t the Christian who had been separated from God and the church became an ob=
ject of horror; and, in a turbulent and fanatic capital that horror might a=
rm the hand of an assassin or inflame a sedition of the people. Pal=C3=A6ol=
ogus felt his danger, confessed his guilt, and deprecated his judge: the ac=
t was irretrievable; the prize was obtained; and the most rigorous penance,=
 which he solicited, would have raised the sinner to the reputation of a sa=

 a crime, great indeed must be the satisfaction. =E2=80=9CDo you require,=
=E2=80=9D said Michael, =E2=80=9Cthat I should abdicate the empire?=E2=80=

le: he was heard to declare that the sinner should swallow the last dregs o=
f the cup of penance; and the foolish tale was propagated of his punishing =
a sacrilegious ass that had tasted the lettuce of a convent-garden. Driven =
from the throne by the universal clamour, Athanasius composed, before his r=
etreat, two papers of a very opposite cast. His public testament was in the=
 tone of charity and resignation; the private codicil breathed the direst a=
nathemas against the authors of his disgrace, whom he excluded for ever fro=
m the communion of the Holy Trinity, the angels, and the saints. This last =
paper he enclosed in an earthen pot, which was placed, by his order, on the=
 top of one of the pillars in the dome of St. Sophia, in the distant hope o=
f discovery and revenge. At the end of four years, some youths, climbing by=
 a ladder in search of pigeons=E2=80=99 nests, detected the fatal secret; a=
nd, as Andronicus felt himself touched and bound by the excommunication, he=
 trembled on the brink of the abyss which had been so treacherously dug und=
er his feet. A synod of bishops was instantly convened to debate this impor=
tant question; the rashness of these clandestine anathemas was generally co=
ndemned; but, as the knot could be untied only by the same hand, as that ha=
nd was now deprived of the crosier, it appeared that this posthumous decree=
 was irrevocable by any earthly power. Some faint testimonies of repentance=
 and pardon were extorted from the author of the mischief; but the conscien=
ce of the emperor was still wounded, and he desired, with no less ardour th=
an Athanasius himself, the restoration of a patriarch by whom alone he coul=
d be healed. At the dead of night a monk rudely knocked at the door of the =
royal bed-chamber, announcing a revelation of plague and famine, of inundat=
ions and earthquakes. Andronicus started from his bed, and spent the night =
in prayer, till he felt, or thought that he felt, a slight motion of the ea=
rth. The emperor, on foot, led the bishops and monks to the cell of Athanas=
ius; and, after a proper resistance, the saint, from whom this message <spa=

ntinople. Untamed by disgrace and hardened by solitude, the shepherd was ag=
ain odious to the flock; and his enemies contrived a singular and, as it pr=
oved, a successful mode of revenge. In the night they stole away the foot-s=
tool or foot-cloth of his throne, which they secretly replaced with the dec=
oration of a satirical picture. The emperor was painted with a bridle in hi=
s mouth, and Athanasius leading the tractable beast to the feet of Christ. =
The authors of the libel were detected and punished; but, as their lives ha=
d been spared, the Christian priest in sullen indignation retired to his ce=
ll; and the eyes of Andronicus, which had been opened for a moment, were ag=
ain closed by his successor.</p>

 motions were slow and doubtful, and their progress was checked by intrigue=
 and negotiation. The quarrel of the two Andronici was protracted, and susp=
ended, and renewed, during a ruinous period of seven years. In the first tr=
eaty the relics of the Greek empire were divided: Constantinople, Thessalon=

ss blushed to hold their lives and fortunes by the precarious favour of an =
usurper; and the thirst of revenge was concealed by a tender concern for th=

a petition of the friends of Cantacuzene, that they might be released from =
their oath of allegiance to the Pal=C3=A6ologi and entrusted with the defen=

itiated by the elder in the mysteries of war and government. After the conc=
lusion of the peace, Pal=C3=A6ologus was left at Thessalonica, a royal resi=
dence and a frontier station, to secure by his absence the peace of Constan=
tinople, and to withdraw his youth from the temptations of a luxurious capi=
tal. But the distance weakened the powers of control, and the son of Andron=
icus was surrounded with artful or unthinking companions, who taught him to=
 hate his guardian, to deplore his exile, and to vindicate his rights. A pr=
ivate treaty with the cral or despot of Servia was soon followed by an open=
 revolt; and Cantacuzene, on the throne of the elder Andronicus, defended t=
he cause of age and prerogative, which in his youth he had so vigorously at=
tacked. At his request, the empress-mother undertook the voyage of Thessalo=
nica, and the office of mediation: she returned without success; and unless=
 Anne of Savoy was instructed by adversity, we may doubt the sincerity, or =
at least the fervour, of her zeal. While the regent grasped the sceptre wit=
h a firm and vigorous hand, she had been instructed to declare that the ten=
 years of his legal administration would soon elapse; and that, after a ful=
l trial of the vanity of the world, the emperor Cantacuzene sighed for the =
repose of a cloister, and was ambitious only of an heavenly crown. Had thes=
e sentiments been genuine, his voluntary abdication would have restored the=
 peace of the empire, and his conscience would have been relieved by an act=
 of justice. Pal=C3=A6ologus alone was responsible for his future governmen=
t; and, whatever might be his vices, they were surely less formidable than =
the calamities of a civil war, in which the Barbarians and infidels were ag=
ain invited to assist the Greeks in their mutual destruction. By the arms o=

uzene prevailed in the third conquest in which he had been involved; and th=
e young emperor, driven from the sea and land, was compelled to take shelte=
r among the Latins of the isle of Tenedos. His insolence and obstinacy prov=
oked the victor to a step which must render the quarrel irreconcileable; an=
d the association of his son Matthew, whom he invested with the purple, est=
ablished the succession in the family of the Cantacuzeni. But Constantinopl=
e was still attached to the blood of her ancient princes; and this last inj=
ury accelerated the restoration of the rightful heir. A noble Genoese espou=
sed the cause of Pal=C3=A6ologus, obtained a promise of his sister, and ach=
ieved the revolution with two galleys and two thousand five hundred auxilia=
ries. Under the pretence of distress they were admitted into the lesser por=
t; a gate was opened, and the Latin shout of =E2=80=9CLong life and victory=
 to the emperor John Pal=C3=A6ologus!=E2=80=9D was answered by a general ri=

fensive war, a supply of fifty empty galleys, and a succour of fifty galley=
s completely armed and manned, was promised by the republic to the empire. =
In the revival of a naval force it was the aim of Michael Pal=C3=A6ologus t=
o deliver himself from a foreign aid; and his vigorous government contained=
 the Genoese of Galata within those limits which the insolence of wealth an=
d freedom provoked them to exceed. A sailor threatened that they should soo=
n be masters of Constantinople, and slew the Greek who resented this nation=
al affront; and an armed vessel, after refusing to salute the palace, was g=
uilty of some acts of piracy in the Black Sea. Their countrymen threatened =
to support their cause; but the long and open village of Galata was instant=
ly surrounded by the Imperial troops; till, in the moment of the assault, t=
he prostrate Genoese implored the clemency of their sovereign. The defencel=
ess situation which secured their obedience exposed them to the attack of t=
heir Venetian rivals, who, in the reign of the elder Andronicus, presumed t=

enoese, with their families and effects, retired into the city; their empty=
 habitations were reduced to ashes; and the feeble prince, who had viewed t=

 ambassadors. This misfortune, however, was advantageous to the Genoese, wh=

Galata with a strong wall; of introducing into the ditch the waters of the =

the fishermen were murdered. Instead of suing for pardon, the Genoese deman=
ded satisfaction; required, in an haughty strain, that the Greeks should re=

first sallies of the popular indignation. They instantly occupied the debat=

royed; and the care of the regent, of the empress Irene, was confined to th=

uld terminate the war, already murmured at their losses; the succours from =
their mother-country were delayed by the factions of Genoa; and the most ca=
utious embraced the opportunity of a Rhodian vessel to remove their familie=
s and effects from the scene of hostility. In the spring, the Byzantine fle=
et, seven galleys and a train of smaller vessels, issued from the mouth of =
the harbour and steered in a single line along the shore of Pera; unskilful=
ly presenting their sides to the beaks of the adverse squadron. The crews w=

 rough; and no sooner did the Greeks perceive a distant and inactive enemy,=
 than they leaped headlong into the sea, from a doubtful to an inevitable p=
eril. The troops that marched to the attack of the lines of Pera were struc=
k at the same moment with a similar panic; and the Genoese were astonished,=
 and almost ashamed, at their double victory. Their triumphant vessels, cro=
wned with flowers, and dragging after them the captive galleys, repeatedly =
passed and repassed before the palace. The only virtue of the emperor was p=
atience, and the hope of revenge his sole consolation. Yet the distress of =
both parties interposed a temporary agreement; and the shame of the empire =
was disguised by a thin veil of dignity and power. Summoning the chiefs of =
the colony, Cantacuzene affected to despise the trivial object of the debat=

, Nisabour, Balch, and Candahar; and the conquest of the rich and populous =
countries of Transoxiana, Carizme, and Chorasan. The destructive hostilitie=
s of Attila and the Huns have long since been elucidated by the example of =
Zingis and the Moguls; and in this more proper place I shall be content to =
observe that, from the Caspian to the Indus, they ruined a tract of many hu=
ndred miles, which <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: c=

d, and that five centuries have not been sufficient to repair the ravages o=
f four years. The Mogul emperor encouraged or indulged the fury of his troo=
ps; the hope of future possession was lost in the ardour of rapine and slau=
ghter; and the cause of the war exasperated their native fierceness by the =
pretence of justice and revenge. The downfall and death of the sultan Moham=
med, who expired unpitied and alone in a desert island of the Caspian Sea, =
is a poor atonement for the calamities of which he was the author. Could th=
e Carizmian empire have been saved by a single hero, it would have been sav=
ed by his son Gelaleddin, whose active valour repeatedly checked the Moguls=
 in the career of victory. Retreating, as he fought, to the banks of the In=
dus, he was oppressed by their innumerable host, till, in the last moment o=
f despair, Gelaleddin spurred his horse into the waves, swam one of the bro=
adest and most rapid rivers of Asia, and extorted the admiration and applau=
se of Zingis himself. It was in this camp that the Mogul emperor yielded wi=
th reluctance to the murmurs of his weary and wealthy troops, who sighed fo=
r the enjoyment of their native land. Incumbered with the spoils of Asia, h=
e slowly measured back his footsteps, betrayed some pity for the misery of =
the vanquished, and declared his intention of rebuilding the cities which h=
ad been swept away by the tempest of his arms. After he had repassed the Ox=
us and Jaxartes, he was joined by two generals, whom he had detached with t=
hirty thousand horse, to subdue the western provinces of Persia. They had t=
rampled on the nations which opposed their passage, penetrated through the =
gates of Derbend, traversed the Volga and the desert, and accomplished the =
circuit of the Caspian Sea, by an expedition which had never been attempted=
 and has never been repeated. The return of Zingis was signalised by the ov=
erthrow of the rebellious or independent kingdoms of Tartary; and he died i=

the restoration of civil magistrates; and to instil the love of peace and j=

second generation. The northern and by degrees the southern empire acquiesc=

 of Mangou; and the nation was loyal to a prince who had been educated in t=

th the bastonade, and afterwards restored to honour and command. Perhaps hi=
s heart was not devoid of the social virtues; perhaps he was not incapable =

are founded on the public interest; and it may be sufficient to applaud the=
 <i>wisdom</i> of a monarch, for the liberality by which he is not impoveri=
shed, and for the justice by which he is strengthened and enriched. To main=
tain the harmony of authority and obedience, to chastise the proud, to prot=

 dominions, to secure the traveller and merchant, to restrain the depredati=
ons of the soldier, to cherish the labours of the husbandman, to encourage =
industry and learning, and, by an equal and modern assessment, to increase =
the revenue without increasing the taxes, are indeed the duties of a prince=
; but, in the discharge of these duties, he finds an ample and immediate re=
compense. Timour might boast that, at his accession to the throne, Asia was=
 the prey of anarchy and rapine, whilst under his prosperous monarchy, a ch=
ild, fearless and unhurt, might carry a purse of gold from the East to the =
West. Such was his confidence of merit that from this reformation he derive=
d excuse for his victories and a title to universal dominion. The four foll=
owing observations will serve to appreciate his claim to the public gratitu=
de; and perhaps we shall conclude that the Mogul emperor was rather the sco=
urge than the benefactor of mankind. 1. If some partial disorders, some loc=
al oppressions, were healed by the sword of Timour, the remedy was far more=
 pernicious than the disease. By their rapine, cruelty, and discord, the pe=

, or burnt, or utterly destroyed, in his presence, and by his troops; and p=

the Byzantine capital, Soliman was overtaken and slain in a bath, after a r=
eign of seven years and ten months. 4. The investiture of Mousa degraded hi=

 accompanied, or preceded, by an army of Franks, to expel the infidels and =
open a way to the holy sepulchre.=E2=80=9D If the suspicious Latins should =
require some pledge, some previous effect of the sincerity of the Greeks, t=

synod can alone consummate the union of the churches: nor can such a synod =
be held till the three Oriental patriarchs, and a great number of bishops, =

long series of oppression and injury: they must be reconciled by some act o=

 are the disciples of Christ, and the Turks are the common enemies of the C=
hristian name. The Armenians, Cyprians, and Rhodians are equally attacked; =
and it will become the piety of the French princes to draw their swords in =
the general defence of religion. 4. Should the subjects of Andronicus be tr=

anuel was lodged in the Louvre; a succession of feasts and balls, the pleas=

indulged in the liberty of his chapel; and the doctors of the Sorbonne were=
 astonished, and possibly scandalised, by the language, the rites, and the =

into furious or stupid insanity; the reins of government were alternately s=

 the pope; and 4. The single or double procession of the Holy Ghost. The ca=
use of either nation was managed by ten theological champions: the Latins w=
ere supported by the inexhaustible eloquence of Cardinal Julian; and Mark o=
f Ephesus and Bessarion of Nice were the bold and able leaders of the Greek=
 forces. We may bestow some praise on the progress of human reason by obser=

 intermediate state of purgation for the venal sins of the faithful; and, w=
hether their souls were purified by elemental fire was a doubtful point, wh=

irst of the five patriarchs; nor did they scruple to admit that his jurisdi=

hich might be defined or eluded by occasional convenience. The procession o=
f the Holy Ghost from the Father alone, or from the Father and the Son, was=
 an article of faith which had sunk much deeper into the minds of men; and =
in the sessions of Ferrara and Florence the Latin addition of <i>filioque</=

 were orthodox. Perhaps it may not be necessary to boast on this subject of=
 my own impartial indifference; but I must think that the Greeks were stron=

 any article whatsoever to the creed of Nice or rather of Constantinople.<a=

 his style is the purest standard of the Attic dialect; and his sublime tho=

re a dramatic picture of the life and death of a sage; and, as often as he =
descends from the clouds, his moral system inculcates the love of truth, of=
 our country, and of mankind. The precept and example of Socrates recommend=

of their leaders; and the field of battle was removed in their flight from =
Constantinople to Rome. But this philosophic debate soon degenerated into a=

 captain and governor of Hungary; and, if envy at first was silenced by ter=

 Yet the idea of a consummate general is not delineated in his campaigns; t=
he white knight fought with the hand rather than the head, as the chief of =

sible to their arms; and they felt him most daring and formidable, when the=
y fondly believed the captain of his country irrecoverably lost. Instead of=
 confining himself to a defensive war, four years after the defeat of Warna=
 he again penetrated into the heart of Bulgaria; and in the plain of Cossov=
a sustained, till the third day, the shock of the Ottoman army, four times =
more numerous than his own. As he fled alone through the woods of Walachia,=
 the hero was surprised by two robbers; but, while they disputed a gold cha=
in that hung at his neck, he recovered his sword, slew the one, terrified t=
he other; and, after new perils of captivity or death, consoled by his pres=
ence an afflicted kingdom. But the last and most glorious action of his lif=
e was the defence of Belgrade against the powers of Mahomet the Second in p=

mpaired his original right; and every year of obedience and reward had ceme=

harboured the belief of Christianity and the intention of revolt, a worthy =
mind must condemn the base dissimulation, that could only serve to betray, =
that could promise only to be forsworn, that could actively join in the tem=

as fixed on the Reis Effendi, or principal secretary; with a dagger at his =
breast, he extorted a firman or patent for the government of Albania; and t=
he murder of the guiltless scribe and his train prevented the consequences =
of an immediate discovery. With some bold companions, to whom he had reveal=
ed his design, he escaped in the night, by rapid marches, from the field of=
 battle to his paternal mountains. The gates of Croya were opened to the ro=
yal mandate; and no sooner did he command the fortress than George Castriot=
 dropped the mask of dissimulation, abjured the Prophet and the sultan, and=
 proclaimed himself the avenger of his family and country. The names of rel=
igion and liberty provoked a general revolt: the Albanians, a martial race,=
 were unanimous to live and die with their hereditary prince; and the Ottom=
an garrisons were indulged in the choice of martyrdom or baptism. In the as=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_421">Of Chinese authorities for the history of the =
Mongols, the most important is the annals entitled <span class=3D"csc">Yuan=
 Shi</span>, of which Bretschneider (Mediaeval Researches for Eastern Asiat=
ic Sources, 1888) gives the following account (vol. i. p. 180 <i>sqq.</i>).=
 In 1369 =E2=80=9Cthe detailed records of the reigns of the thirteen Y=C3=
=BCan emperors were procured, and the emperor (Hungwu) gave orders to compi=
le the history of the Y=C3=BCan [Mongols], under the direction of <i>Sung L=
ien</i> and <i>Wang Wei.</i> The work, which occupied sixteen scholars, was=
 begun in the second month of 1369 and finished in the eighth month of the =
same year. But as at that time the record of the reign of Shun ti (the last=
 Mongol emperor in China) was not yet received, the scholar <i>Ou yang Yu</=
i> and others were sent to <i>Pei p=E2=80=99ing</i> to obtain the required =
information. In the sixth month of 1370 the Y=C3=BCan Shi was complete.=E2=
=80=9D There were various subsequent <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"deco=
ration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>330<=
span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> editions. =E2=80=9CThe Y=C3=BCan Shi=
 has been compiled from official documents. Perhaps we must except the biog=
raphies, for which the information was probably often derived from private =
sources. It seems that the greater part of the documents on which the Chine=
se history of the Mongols is based had been drawn up in the Chinese languag=
e; but in some cases they appear to have been translated from the Mongol. I=
 conclude this from the fact that in the Y=C3=BCan Shi places are often men=
tioned, not, as usually, by their Chinese names, but by their Mongol names =
represented in Chinese characters=E2=80=9D (p. 183). The Yuan Shi (p. 185 <=
i>sqq.</i>) is divided into four sections: (1) consists of the lives of the=
 13 Mongol Khans in Mongolia and China, and the annals of their reigns from=
 Chingiz to Shun ti (1368); (2) memoirs (geographical, astronomical, politi=
co-economical notices; regulations on dress, rites, public appointments, et=
c.; military ordinances, etc.); (3) genealogical tables and lists; (4) abou=
t a thousand biographies of eminent men of the period [Bretschneider observ=
es that these biographies =E2=80=9Cbear evidence to the liberal views of th=
e Mongol emperors as to the acknowledgment of merit. They seem never to hav=
e been influenced by national considerations=E2=80=9D]; and notices of fore=
ign lands and nations south and east of China (<i>e.g.</i>, Korea, Japan, B=
urma, Sumatra).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_422">An abstract of the annals of the Y=C3=BCan shi=
 is contained in the first ten chapters of the <span class=3D"csc">Y=C3=BCa=
n shi lei pien</span> (an abbreviated History of the Mongols) which were tr=
anslated by Gaubil in his Histoire de Gentchiscan (see above p. 133, note 1=
1). From this abstract, and the Y=C3=BCan shi and another work entitled the=
 Shi Wei (Woof of History), Mr. R. K. Douglas compiled his Life of Jinghiz =
Kh=C4=81n, 1877.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_423">The <span class=3D"csc">Y=C3=BCan ch=E2=80=98a=
o pi shi</span>, Secret History of the Mongol dynasty, is a Chinese transla=
tion of a Mongol work, which was completed before 1240. It contains the ear=
ly history of the Mongols, the reign of Chingiz, and part of the reign of O=
gotai; and it was translated into Chinese in the early period of the Ming d=
ynasty. An abridgment of this work was translated into Russian by Palladius=
, and published in 1866 in the Records of the Russian Ecclesiastical Missio=
n at Peking, vol. 4. It was only six years later that Palladius found that =
the work was extant in a fuller form. Bretschneider says: This document =E2=
=80=9Ccorroborates generally Rashid-eddin=E2=80=99s records, and occasional=
ly we find passages in it which sound like a literal translation of the sta=
tements of the Persian historiographer. This proves that Rashid had made us=
e of the same source of information as the unknown author of the Y=C3=BCan =
ch=E2=80=98ao pi shi. As to the dates in the latter work, they are generall=
y in accordance with the dates given by the Mohammadan authors; but in a fe=
w cases the Y=C3=BCan ch=E2=80=98ao pi shi commits great chronological blun=
ders and misplacements of events, as, for instance, with respect to the war=
 in the west.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_424">In his work cited above Bretschneider has rend=
ered accessible other Chinese documents bearing on Mongol history, especial=
ly some relations of Chinese travellers and envoys; for example, an extract=
 (i. p. 9 <i>sqq.</i>) from the Si Yu Lu (Description of Journey to the Wes=
t) of Ye-l=C3=BC Ch=E2=80=99u ts=E2=80=98ai, a minister of Chingiz who atte=
nded him to Persia, 1219-24. (There is a biography of this Ye-l=C3=BC in th=
e Y=C3=BCan Shi.) Bretschneider makes valuable contributions to the difficu=
lt subject of geographical identifications, and discusses among other docum=
ents the account of the Armenian prince Haithon=E2=80=99s visit to Mongolia=
, written by Guiragos Gandsaketsi. This Haithon I. must not be confounded w=
ith Haithon, the monk of Pr=C3=A9montr=C3=A9, mentioned by Gibbon (above p.=
 133, note 13). The account of Guiragos was translated into French by Klapr=
oth (Nouv. Journ. Asiat., p. 273 <i>sqq.</i>, 1833) from a Russian <span cl=

rosset.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_425"><span class=3D"csc">Ssanang Ssetsen</span>, a =
prince of the tribe of Ordus and a descendant of Chingiz, born <span class=

 history of the eastern Mongols which he finished in 1662. It was thus writ=
ten after the Manchus had conquered China and overthrown the Mongols. The e=
arlier part of the book is practically a history of Tibet. The account of t=
he origin of the Mongols is translated from Chinese sources. The author is =
a zealous Buddhist and dwells at great length on all that concerned the int=
erests of his religion; other matters are often dismissed far too briefly. =
The relation of the career of Chingiz is marked by many anachronisms and in=
accuracies. The work was made accessible by the German translation of I. J.=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_429">If Gibbon had been more fully acquainted with =

some pages to the rise of their fortunes. They rose to such power and influ=

ajoli, which formed a distinguished commercial company at Florence in the t=
hirteenth century, settled in the Peloponnesus about the middle of the four=
teenth, under the protection of Robert, king of Naples. Nicholas Acciajoli =
was invested, in the year 334, with the administration of the lands which t=
he company had acquired in payment or in security of the loans it had made =
to the royal House of Anjou; and he acquired additional possessions in the =
principality of Achaia, both by purchase and grant, from Catherine of Valoi=
s, titular empress of Romania and regent of Achaia for her son prince Rober=
t. [It is disputed whether he was her lover.] The encroachments of the merc=
antile spirit on the feudal system are displayed in the concessions obtaine=
d by Nicholas Acciajoli in the grants he received from Catherine of Valois.=
 He was invested with the power of mortgaging, exchanging, and selling his =
fiefs, without any previous authorisation from his suzerain. Nicholas acted=
 as principal minister of Catherine during a residence of three years in th=
e Morea; and he made use of his position, like a prudent banker, to obtain =
considerable grants of territory. He returned to Italy in 1341 and never ag=
ain visited Greece; but his estates in Achaia were administered by his rela=
tions and other members of the banking house at Florence, many of whom obta=
ined considerable fiefs for themselves through his influence.</p>

as a reward for his fidelity, and subsequently Malta was added to his posse=
ssions. He was an able statesman and a keen political intriguer; and he was=
 almost the first example of the superior position the purse of the moneyed=
 citizen was destined to assume over the sword of the feudal baron and the =
learning of the politic churchman. Nicholas Acciajoli was the first of that=
 banking aristocracy which has since held an important position in European=
 history. He was the type of a class destined at times to decide the fate o=
f kingdoms and at times to arrest the progress of armies. He certainly dese=
rved to have his life written by a man of genius, but his superciliousness =
and assumption of princely state, even in his intercourse with the friends =
of his youth, disgusted Boccaccio, who alone of Florentine contemporaries c=
ould have left a vivid sketch of the career which raised him from the partn=
er of a banking-house to the rank of a great feudal baron and to live in th=
e companionship of kings. Boccaccio, offended by his insolence, seems not t=
o have appreciated his true importance as the type of a coming age and a ne=
w state of society; and the indignant and satirical record he has left of t=
he pride and presumption of the mercantile noble is by no means a correct p=
ortrait of the Neapolitan minister. Yet even Boccaccio records in his usual=
 truthful manner that Nicholas had dispersed powerful armies, though he unj=
ustly depreciates the merit of the success, because the victory was gained =
by combinations effected by gold, and not by the headlong charge of a line =
of lances. [Boccaccio dedicated his <i>Donne illustri</i> to Niccolo=E2=80=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_440">It is only recently that European history has =

and and occupied Hungary in the spring of <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D=

not due to a mere overwhelming superiority of numbers. But this fact has no=

nts the Tartars as a wild horde carrying all before them solely by their mu=
ltitude, and galloping through Eastern Europe without a strategic plan, rus=
hing at all obstacles and overcoming them by mere weight, still prevails. I=
t will therefore not be amiss to explain very briefly the plan and executio=
n of the Mongol campaign. The nominal commander-in-chief was Batu, but ther=
e is no doubt that the management of the expedition was in the hands of Sub=
utai.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_441">The objective of Subutai was Hungary, =E2=80=
=94 the occupation of Hungary and the capture of Gran (Strigonium), which w=
as then not only the ecclesiastical capital but the most important town in =
the country. In advancing on Hungary, his right flank was exposed to an att=
ack from the princes of Poland, behind whom were the forces of Bohemia and =
North Germany. To meet this danger, Subutai divided his host into two parts=
, which we may call the northern and the southern army. The duty of the nor=
thern army was to sweep over Poland, advance to Bohemia, and effectually pr=
event the princes of the north from interfering with the operations of the =
southern army in Hungary. Thus strategically the invasion of Poland was sub=
sidiary to the invasion of Hungary, and the northern army, when its work wa=
s done, was to meet the southern or main army on the Danube.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_442">The northern army advanced in three divisions.=
 The main force under Baidar marched through the dominions of Boleslaw the =
Chaste, and took Cracow; then bearing north-westward it reached Oppeln on t=
he Oder, where it defeated Prince Mieczyslaw; and descended the Oder to Bre=
slau. At the same time Kaidu advanced by a more northerly route through the=
 land of Conrad, prince of Mosovia and Cujavia; while on the extreme right =
a force under Ordu terrified the Lithuanians and Prussians and crossed the =
Lower Vistula. The three divisions reunited punctually at Breslau, the capi=
tal of Henry II. of Lower Silesia; and all took part in the battle of Liegn=
itz (April 9), for which King Wenzel of Bohemia arrived too late. Just one =
day too late: the Mongol generals had skilfully managed to force Prince Hen=
ry to fight before his arrival. Wenzel discreetly withdrew beyond the mount=
ains into Bohemia; all he could hope to do was to defend his own kingdom. S=
axony now lived in dread that its turn had come. But it was no part of the =
plan of Subutai to launch his troops into Northern Germany. They had annihi=
lated the forces of Poland; it was now time for them to approach the main a=
rmy in Hungary. The Mongols therefore turned their back upon the north, and=
 marched through Upper Silesia and Moravia, capturing town after town as th=
ey went. Upon Wenzel who watched them with a large army, expecting them to =
invade Bohemia, they played a trick. He was posted near the defile of Glatz=
 and the Mongols were at Ottmachau. They were too wary to attack him in suc=
h a position; it was necessary to remove him. Accordingly they marched back=
 as if they purposed to invade Bohemia by the pass of the K=C3=B6nigstein i=
n the north. Wenzel marched to the threatened point; and when the Mongols s=
aw him safely there, they rapidly retraced their steps and reached Moravia =
(end of April, beginning of May).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_443">Meanwhile the main army advanced into Hungary =
in three columns converging on the Upper Theiss. The right wing was led by =
Shaiban, a younger brother of Batu, and seems to have advanced on the Porta=
 Hungariae =E2=80=94 the north-western entrance to Hungary, in the Little C=
arpathians. The central column under Subutai himself, with Batu, marched on=
 the Porta Rusciae, the defile which leads from Galicia into the valley of =
the Theiss. The left column, under Kadan and Buri, moved through Transylvan=
ia towards the K=C3=B6r=C3=B6s.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_444">The Porta Rusciae was carried, its defenders a=
nnihilated, on March 15; and a flying column of Tartars shot across Hungary=
, in advance of the main army. On March 15 they were half a day=E2=80=99s j=
ourney from Pest, having ridden about 180 miles in less than three days. On=
 the 17th they fought and defeated an Hungarian force, and on the same day =
Shaiban=E2=80=99s right column captured Waitzen, a fort near the angle wher=
e the Danube bends southward. The object of Subutai in sending the advance =
squadron Pestward <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: cu=
rrent; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>338<span class=3D"brack=
et">]</span></span> was doubtless to multiply difficulties for the Hungaria=
ns in organising their preparations. These preparations were already hamper=
ed by the conflicts and jealousies between the king and his nobles; and the=
n towards the end of March befell the murder of Kutan, the chief of the Cum=
ans, and the consequent revolt of the Cumans, =E2=80=94 mentioned by Gibbon=
, =E2=80=94 which demolished the defence of Eastern Hungary. Meanwhile Kada=
n=E2=80=99s left column had advanced through Transylvania and passed the K=
=C3=B6r=C3=B6s and Theiss; in the first days of April it advanced to the Da=
nube, in the neighbourhood of Pest. Subutai had in the meantime arrived him=
self with the main central column, and the three columns of the central arm=
y were now together in position on the left bank of the Danube from Waitzen=
 to Pest. But the Hungarian army with its German allies and Slavonic contin=
gents had united at Pest, about 100,000 strong; and it was impossible for t=
he Mongols to cross in the face of such a host. Accordingly Subutai began a=
 retreat, drawing the enemy after him. He retired behind the Saj=C3=B3, not=
 far from the confluence of that river with the Theiss, =E2=80=94 a central=
 position on the route from Pest to Galicia, where he was in touch with his=
 own base of operations near Unghvar and the Porta Rusciae. The Hungarians =
took up their position on the opposite bank in the plain of Mohi. By skilfu=
l tactics the Mongols surrounded their camp and cut them to pieces on April=
 11, two days after the northern army had gained the battle of Liegnitz.</p=
>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_445">It was wonderful how punctually and effectuall=
y the arrangements of the commander were carried out in operations extendin=
g from the Lower Vistula to Transylvania. Such a campaign was quite beyond =
the power of any European army of the time; and it was beyond the vision of=
 any European commander. There was no general in Europe, from Frederick II.=
 downward, who was not a tiro in strategy compared to Subutai. It should al=
so be noticed that the Mongols embarked upon the enterprise, with full know=
ledge of the political situation of Hungary and the condition of Poland; th=
ey had taken care to inform themselves by a well-organised system of spies:=
 on the other hand, the Hungarians and Christian powers, like childish Barb=
arians, knew hardly anything about their enemies.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_446">The foregoing summary is founded on the excell=
ent study of G. Strakosch-Grassmann, Der Einfall der Mongolen, in Mitteleur=
opa in den Jahren 1241 und 1242, 1893, and the vivid account of L. Cahun, i=
n his Introduction =C3=A0 l=E2=80=99Histoire de l=E2=80=99Asie, p. 352 <i>s=
qq.</i> The chief defect in Strakosch-Grassmann=E2=80=99s book is that he d=
oes not give to Subutai his proper place. The important Chinese biography o=
f Subutai is translated in the first vol. of Bretschneider=E2=80=99s Medi=
=C3=A6val Researches from Eastern Asiatic Sources, 1888. All the western au=
thorities have been carefully studied and analysed by Strakosch-Grassmann. =

extend his conquests in every direction. To the east he rendered himself ma=

f Islam the head of the state is not bound by the law, but is responsible o=

 broke completely with the Mongol tradition, such as it had been developed =
