ays would be destroyed by the same inconstancy that had created him. The sp=

Several of the pretenders who raised the standard of rebellion against the =
emperor Gallienus were shining models of virtue, and almost all possessed a=
 considerable share of vigour and ability. Their merit had recommended them=
 to the favour of Valerian, and gradually promoted them to the most importa=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_434">The apprehensions of Saturninus were justified=
 by the repeated experience of revolutions. Of the nineteen tyrants who sta=
rted up under the reign of Gallienus, there was not one who enjoyed a life =
of peace, or a natural death. As soon as they were invested with the bloody=
 purple, they inspired their adherents with the same fears and ambition whi=
ch had occasioned their own revolt. Encompassed with domestic conspiracy, m=
ilitary sedition, and civil war, they trembled on the edge of precipices, i=
n which, after a longer or shorter term of anxiety, they were inevitably lo=
st. These precarious monarchs received, however, such honours as the flatte=
ry of their respective armies and provinces could bestow; but their claim, =
founded on rebellion, could never obtain the sanction of law or history. It=
aly, Rome, and the senate constantly adhered to the cause of Gallienus, and=
 he alone was considered <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edit=
ion: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>53<span class=3D=
"bracket">]</span></span> as the sovereign of the empire. That prince conde=
scended indeed to acknowledge the victorious arms of Odenathus, who deserve=
d the honourable distinction by the respectful conduct which he always main=
tained towards the son of Valerian. With the general applause of the Romans=
 and the consent of Gallienus, the senate conferred the title of Augustus o=
n the brave Palmyrenian; and seemed to entrust him with the government of t=
he East, which he already possessed, in so independent a manner, that, like=
 a private succession, he bequeathed it to his illustrious widow Zenobia.<a=

ottage to the throne, and from the throne to the grave, might have amused a=
n indifferent philosopher, were it possible for a philosopher to remain ind=
ifferent amidst the general calamities of human kind. The election of these=
 precarious emperors, their power and their death, were equally destructive=
 to their subjects and adherents. The price of their fatal elevation was in=
stantly discharged to the troops by an immense donative drawn from the bowe=
ls of the exhausted people. However virtuous was their character, however p=
ure their intentions, they found themselves reduced to the hard necessity o=
f supporting their usurpation by frequent acts of rapine and cruelty. When =
they fell, they involved armies and provinces in their fall. There is still=

ry to revive among his troops a sense of order and obedience. With the auth=
ority of a veteran commander, he represented to them that the relaxation of=
 discipline had introduced a long train of disorders, the effects of which =
were at length experienced by the soldiers themselves; that a people ruined=
 by oppression, and indolent from despair, could no longer supply a numerou=

 were repulsed with shame and loss from the fortified cities which they ass=

 of Claudius, hastening to a scene of action that deserved the presence of =
a warlike prince at the head of the remaining powers of the empire. Impatie=

">15</a> do not enable us to describe the order and circumstances of his ex=
ploits; but, if we could be indulged in the illusion, we might distribute i=
nto three acts this memorable tragedy. I. The decisive battle was fought ne=
ar Naissus, a city of Dardania. The legions at first gave way, oppressed by=
 numbers, and dismayed by misfortunes. Their ruin was inevitable, had not t=
he abilities of their emperor prepared a seasonable relief. A large detachm=
ent, rising out of the secret and difficult passes of the mountains, which,=
 by his order, they had occupied, suddenly assailed the rear of the victori=
ous Goths. The favourable instant was improved by the activity of Claudius.=
 He revived the courage of his troops, restored their ranks, and pressed th=
e barbarians on every side. Fifty thousand men are reported to have been sl=
ain in the battle of Naissus. Several large bodies of barbarians, covering =
their retreat with a movable fortification of waggons, retired, or rather e=
scaped, from the field of slaughter. II. We may presume that some insurmoun=
table difficulty, the fatigue, perhaps, or the disobedience, of the conquer=
ors, prevented Claudius from completing in one day <span class=3D"pb"><span=
 class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket=
">[</span>68<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> the destruction of the =
Goths. The war was diffused over the provinces of M=C3=A6sia, Thrace, and M=
acedonia, and its operations drawn out into a variety of marches, surprises=
, and tumultuary engagements, as well by sea as by land. When the Romans su=
ffered any loss, it was commonly occasioned by their own cowardice or rashn=
ess; but the superior talents of the emperor, his perfect knowledge of the =
country, and his judicious choice of measures as well as officers, assured =
on most occasions the success of his arms. The immense booty, the fruit of =
so many victories, consisted for the greater part of cattle and slaves. A s=
elect body of the Gothic youth was received among the Imperial troops; the =
remainder was sold into servitude; and so considerable was the number of fe=
male captives, that every soldier obtained to his share two or three women.=
 A circumstance from which we may conclude that the invaders entertained so=
me designs of settlement as well as of plunder; since even in a naval exped=
ition they were accompanied by their families. III. The loss of their fleet=
, which was either taken or sunk, had intercepted the retreat of the Goths.=
 A vast circle of Roman posts, distributed with skill, supported with firmn=
ess, and gradually closing towards a common centre, forced the barbarians i=
nto the most inaccessible parts of Mount H=C3=A6mus, where they found a saf=
e refuge, but a very scanty subsistence. During the course of a rigorous wi=
nter, in which they were besieged by the emperor=E2=80=99s troops, famine a=
nd pestilence, desertion and the sword, continually diminished the imprison=
ed multitude. On the return of spring, nothing appeared in arms except a ha=
rdy and desperate band, the remnant of that mighty host which had embarked =
at the mouth of the Dniester.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_453">The pestilence which swept away such numbers o=
f the barbarians at length proved fatal to their conqueror. After a short b=
ut glorious reign of two years, Claudius expired at Sirmium, amidst the tea=
rs and acclamations of his subjects. In his last illness, he convened the p=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_456">The reign of Aurelian lasted only four years a=

some memorable achievement. He put an end to the Gothic war, chastised the =
Germans who invaded Italy, recovered Gaul, Spain, and Britain out of the ha=

 in the East on the ruins of the afflicted empire.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_457">It was the rigid attention of Aurelian even to=
 the minutest articles of discipline which bestowed such uninterrupted succ=
ess on his arms. His military regulations are contained in a very concise e=
pistle to one of his inferior officers, who is commanded to enforce them, a=
s he wishes to become a tribune, or as he is desirous to live. Gaming, drin=
king, and the arts of divination were severely prohibited. Aurelian expecte=
d that his soldiers should be modest, frugal, and laborious; that their arm=
our should be constantly kept bright, their weapons sharp, their clothing a=
nd horses ready for immediate service; that they should live in their quart=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_458">The death of Claudius had revived the fainting=
 spirit of the Goths. The troops which guarded the passes of Mount H=C3=A6m=

call to their assistance two subordinate colleagues; and that the <i>C=C3=

and was generally carried in a close litter, his disorder, before he arrive=

arming. During the whole winter he was confined to his palace; his danger i=
nspired a general and unaffected concern; but the people could only judge o=

 they discovered in the countenances and behaviour of his attendants. The r=
umour of his death was for some time universally believed, and it was suppo=

pened during the absence of the C=C3=A6sar Galerius. At length, however, on=
 the first of March, Diocletian once more appeared in public, but so pale a=

is person was the most familiar. It was time to put an end to the painful s=
truggle, which he had sustained during more than a year, between the care o=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_587">According to the advice, or rather the orders,=
 of his colleague, the emperor Severus immediately hastened to Rome, in the=
 full confidence that, by his unexpected celerity, he should easily suppres=
s the tumult of an unwarlike populace, commanded by a licentious youth. But=
 he found on his arrival the gates of the city shut against him, the walls =
filled with men and arms, an experienced general at the head of the rebels,=
 and his own troops without spirit or affection. A large body of Moors dese=
rted to the enemy, allured by the promise of a large donative; and, if it b=
e true that they had been levied by Maximian in his African war, preferring=
 the natural feelings of gratitude to the artificial ties of allegiance. An=
ulinus, the Pr=C3=A6torian prefect, declared himself in favour of Maxentius=
, and drew after him the most considerable part of the troops, accustomed t=
o obey his commands. Rome, according to the expression of an orator, recall=
ed her armies, and the unfortunate Severus, destitute of force and of couns=
el, retired, or rather fled, with precipitation <span class=3D"pb"><span cl=
ass=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[=
</span>213<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> to Ravenna. Here he might=
 for some time have been safe. The fortifications of Ravenna were able to r=
esist the attempts, and the morasses that surrounded the town were sufficie=
nt to prevent the approach, of the Italian army. The sea, which Severus com=
manded with a powerful fleet, secured him an inexhaustible supply of provis=
ions, and gave a free entrance to the legions which, on the return of sprin=
g, would advance to his assistance from Illyricum and the East. Maximian, w=
ho conducted the siege in person, was soon convinced that he might waste hi=
s time and his army in the fruitless enterprise, and that he had nothing to=
 hope either from force or famine. With an art more suitable to the charact=
er of Diocletian than to his own, he directed his attack, not so much again=
st the walls of Ravenna as against the mind of Severus. The treachery which=
 he had experienced disposed that unhappy prince to distrust the most since=
re of his friends and adherents. The emissaries of Maximian easily persuade=
d his credulity that a conspiracy was formed to betray the town, and prevai=
led upon his fears not to expose himself to the discretion of an irritated =
conqueror, but to accept the faith of an honourable capitulation. He was at=
 first received with humanity, and treated with respect. Maximian conducted=
 the captive emperor to Rome, and gave him the most solemn assurances that =
he had secured his life by the resignation of the purple. But Severus could=
 obtain only an easy death and an Imperial funeral. When the sentence was s=
ignified to him, the manner of executing it was left to his own choice; he =
preferred the favourite mode of the ancients, that of opening his veins: an=
d, as soon as he expired, his body was carried to the sepulchre which had b=
een constructed for the family of Gallienus.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyf=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_588">Though the characters of Constantine and Maxen=
tius had very little affinity with each other, their situation and interest=
 were the same; and prudence seemed to require that they should unite their=
 forces against the common enemy. Notwithstanding the superiority of his ag=

personal interview with the sovereign of Gaul, carried with him his daughte=
r Fausta as the pledge of the new alliance. The marriage was celebrated at =
Arles with every circumstance of magnificence; and the ancient colleague of=
 Diocletian, who again asserted his claim to the Western empire, conferred =
on his son-in-law and ally the title of Augustus. By consenting to receive =
that honour from Maximian, Constantine seemed to embrace the cause of Rome =
and of the senate; but his professions were ambiguous, and his assistance s=
low and ineffectual. He considered with attention the approaching contest b=
etween the masters of Italy and the emperor of the East, and was prepared t=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_589">The importance of the occasion called for the =
presence and abilities of Galerius. At the head of a powerful army, collect=
ed from Illyricum and the East, he entered Italy, resolved to revenge the d=
eath of Severus, and to chastise the rebellious Romans; or, as he expressed=
 his intentions, in the furious language of a barbarian, to extirpate the s=
enate, and to destroy the people by the sword. But the skill of Maximian ha=
d concerted a prudent system of defence. The invader found every place host=
ile, fortified, and inaccessible; and, though he forced his way as far as N=
arni, within sixty miles of Rome, his dominion in Italy was confined to the=
 narrow limits of his camp. Sensible to the increasing difficulties of his =
enterprise, the haughty Galerius made the first advances towards a reconcil=
iation, and despatched two of his most considerable officers to tempt the R=
oman princes by the offer of a conference and the declaration of his patern=
al regard for Maxentius, who might obtain much more from his liberality tha=
n he could hope from the doubtful chance of war.<a href=3D"https://oll.libe=

ejected with firmness, his perfidious friendship refused with contempt, and=
 it was not long before he discovered that, unless he provided for his safe=
ty by a timely retreat, he had some reason to apprehend the fate of Severus=
. The wealth, which the Romans defended against his rapacious tyranny, they=
 freely contributed for his destruction. The name of Maximian, the popular =
arts of his son, the secret distribution of large sums, and the promise of =
still more liberal rewards, checked the ardour and corrupted the fidelity o=
f the Illyrian legions; and, when Galerius at length gave the signal of the=
 retreat, it was with some difficulty that he could prevail on his veterans=
 not to desert a banner which had so often conducted them to victory and ho=
nour. A contemporary writer assigns <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decor=

 will scarcely venture to adopt them. We are told that Galerius, who had fo=
rmed a very imperfect notion of the greatness of Rome by the cities of the =
East with which he was acquainted, found his forces inadequate to the siege=
 of that immense capital. But the extent of a city serves only to render it=
 more accessible to the enemy; Rome had long since been accustomed to submi=
t on the approach of a conqueror; nor could the temporary enthusiasm of the=
 people have long contended against the discipline and valour of the legion=
s. We are likewise informed that the legions themselves were struck with ho=
rror and remorse, and that those pious sons of the republic refused to viol=
ate the sanctity of their venerable parent.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfu=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_590">The legions of Galerius exhibited a very melan=

they passed, and they endeavoured to destroy the country, which it had not =
been in their power to subdue. During the whole march Maxentius hung on the=

Gaul, with the hope of persuading Constantine, who had assembled an army on=
 the frontier, to join the pursuit and to complete the victory. But the act=

onvinced of the vanity of greatness and ambition. Had he persevered in this=
 resolution, he might have ended his life with less dignity indeed than in =
his first retirement, yet, however, with comfort and reputation. But the ne=
ar prospect of a throne brought back to his remembrance the state from when=
ce he was fallen, and he resolved, by a desperate effort, either to reign o=
r to perish. An incursion of the Franks had summoned Constantine, with a pa=
rt of his army, to the banks of the Rhine; the remainder of the troops were=
 stationed in the southern provinces of Gaul, which lay exposed to the ente=
rprises of the Italian emperor, and a considerable treasure was deposited i=
n the city of Arles. Maximian either craftily invented, or hastily credited=
, a vain report of the death of Constantine. Without hesitation he ascended=
 the throne, seized the treasure, and, scattering it with his accustomed pr=
ofusion among the soldiers, endeavoured to awake in their minds the memory =
of his ancient dignity and exploits. Before he could establish his authorit=
y, or finish the negotiation which he appears to have entered into with his=
 son Maxentius, the celerity of Constantine defeated all his hopes. On the =
first news of his perfidy and ingratitude, that prince returned by rapid ma=
rches from the Rhine to the Saone, embarked on the last-mentioned river at =
Chalons, and, at Lyons trusting himself to the rapidity of the Rhone, arriv=
ed at the gates of Arles, with a military force which it was impossible for=
 Maximian to resist, and which scarcely permitted him to take refuge in the=
 neighbouring city of Marseilles. The narrow neck of land which joined that=
 place to the continent was fortified against the besiegers, whilst the sea=
 was open, either for the escape of Maximian, or for the succours of Maxent=
ius, if the latter should choose to disguise his invasion of Gaul under the=
 honourable pretence <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition:=

n injured father. Apprehensive of the fatal consequences of delay, Constant=
ine gave orders for an immediate assault; but the scaling ladders were foun=
d too short for the height of the walls, and Marseilles might have sustaine=
d as long a siege as it formerly did against the arms of C=C3=A6sar, if the=
 garrison, conscious either of their fault or of their danger, had not purc=
hased their pardon by delivering up the city and the person of Maximian. A =
secret but irrevocable sentence of death was pronounced against the usurper=
; he obtained only the same favour which he had indulged to Severus, and it=
 was published to the world that, oppressed by the remorse of his repeated =
crimes, he strangled himself with his own hands. After he had lost the assi=
stance, and disdained the moderate counsels, of Diocletian, the second peri=
od of his active life was a series of public calamities and personal mortif=
ications, which were terminated, in about three years, by an ignominious de=
ath. He deserved his fate; but we should find more reason to applaud the hu=
manity of Constantine, if he had spared an old man, the benefactor of his f=
ather, and the father of his wife. During the whole of this melancholy tran=

 who had been trained to arms in the school of Probus and Diocletian. The m=

ful contest had already lasted from the dawn of day to a late hour of the e=
vening when the right wing, which Constantine led in person, made a vigorou=

r of his troops from a total defeat; but, when he computed his loss, which =
amounted to more than twenty thousand men, he thought it unsafe to pass the=
 night in the presence of an active and victorious enemy. Abandoning his ca=

 the greatest part of his cavalry, and was soon removed beyond the danger o=
f a pursuit. His diligence preserved his wife, his son, and his treasures, =
which he had deposited at Sirmium. Licinius passed through that city, and, =

egular series of the Imperial laws commences about this period, it would no=

any of his laws which, as far as they concern the rights and property of in=

he vexatious as well as cruel prosecutions of the officers of the revenue a=
gainst their insolvent debtors. The less opulent or less industrious part o=
f mankind, instead of rejoicing in an increase of family, deemed it an act =
of paternal tenderness to release their children from the impending miserie=
s of a life which they themselves were unable to support. The humanity of C=
onstantine, moved, perhaps, by some recent and extraordinary instances of d=
espair, engaged him to address an edict to all the cities of Italy, and aft=
erwards of Africa, directing immediate and sufficient relief to be given to=
 those parents who should produce, before the magistrates, the children who=
m their own poverty would not allow them to educate. But the promise was to=

benefit.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/gibbon-the-history-of-=

our and danger of Constantine are attested by a slight wound which he recei=
ved in the thigh; but it may be discovered even from an imperfect narration=
, and, perhaps, a corrupted text, that the victory was obtained no less by =
the conduct of the general than by the courage of the hero; that a body of =
five thousand archers marched round to occupy a thick wood in the rear of t=
he enemy, whose attention was diverted by the construction of a bridge; and=
 that Licinius, perplexed by so many artful evolutions, was reluctantly dra=
wn from his advantageous post to combat on equal ground in the plain. The c=
ontest was no longer equal. His confused multitude of new levies was easily=
 vanquished by the experienced veterans of the West. Thirty-four thousand m=
en are reported to have been slain. The fortified camp of Licinius was take=
n by assault the evening of the battle; the greater part of the fugitives, =
who had retired to the mountains, surrendered themselves the next day to th=
e discretion of the conqueror; and his rival, who could no longer keep the =
field, confined himself within the walls of Byzantium.<a href=3D"https://ol=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_613">The siege of Byzantium, which was immediately =
undertaken by Constantine, was attended with great labour and uncertainty. =
In the late civil wars, the fortifications of that place, so justly conside=
red as the key of Europe and Asia, had been repaired and strengthened; and,=
 as long as Licinius remained master of the sea, the garrison was much less=
 exposed to the danger of famine than the army of the besiegers. The naval =
commanders of Constantine were summoned to his camp, and received his posit=
ive orders to force the passage of the Hellespont, as the fleet of Licinius=
, instead of seeking and destroying their feeble enemy, continued inactive =
in those narrow straits where its superiority of numbers was of little use =
or advantage. Crispus, the emperor=E2=80=99s eldest son, was entrusted with=
 the execution of this daring enterprise, which he performed with so much c=
ourage and success, that he deserved the esteem, and most probably excited =
the jealousy, of his father. The engagement lasted two days, and, in the ev=
ening of the first, the contending fleets, after a considerable and mutual =
loss, retired into their respective harbours of Europe and Asia. The second=
 day about noon a strong south wind<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/t=

rispus against the enemy; and, as the casual advantage was improved by his =
skilful intrepidity, he soon obtained a complete victory. An hundred and th=
irty vessels were destroyed, five thousand men were slain and Amandus, the =
admiral of the Asiatic fleet, escaped with the utmost difficulty to the sho=
res of Chalcedon. As soon as the Hellespont was open, a plentiful convoy of=
 provisions flowed into the camp of Constantine, who had already advanced t=
he operations of the siege. He constructed artificial mounds of earth of an=
 equal height with the ramparts <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoratio=

 erected on that foundation galled the besieged with large stones and darts=
 from the military engines, and the battering-rams had shaken the walls in =
several places. If Licinius persisted much longer in the defence, he expose=
d himself to be involved in the ruin of the place. Before he was surrounded=
, he prudently removed his person and treasures to Chalcedon in Asia; and, =
as he was always desirous of associating companions to the hopes and danger=
s of his fortune, he now bestowed the title of C=C3=A6sar on Martinianus, w=
ho exercised one of the most important offices of the empire.<a href=3D"htt=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_614">Such were still the resources, and such the ab=

in Bithynia a new army of fifty or sixty thousand men, while the activity o=
f Constantine was employed in the siege of Byzantium. The vigilant emperor =
did not, however, neglect the last struggles of his antagonist. A considera=
ble part of his victorious army was transported over the Bosphorus in small=
 vessels, and the decisive engagement was fought soon after their landing o=
n the heights of Chrysopolis, or, as it is now called, of Scutari. The troo=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_617"><span class=3D"csc">A candid</span> but ration=
al inquiry into the progress and establishment of Christianity may be consi=
dered as a very essential part of the history of the Roman empire. While th=
at great body was invaded by open violence, or undermined by slow decay, a =
pure and humble religion gently insinuated itself into the minds of men, gr=
ew up in silence and obscurity, derived new vigour from opposition, and fin=
ally erected the triumphant banner of the cross on the ruins of the Capitol=
. Nor was the influence of Christianity confined to the period or to the li=
mits of the Roman empire. After a revolution of thirteen or fourteen centur=
ies, that religion is still professed by the nations of Europe, the most di=
stinguished portion of human kind in arts and learning as well as in arms. =
By the industry and zeal of the Europeans it has been widely diffused to th=
e most distant shores of Asia and Africa; and by the means of their colonie=
s has been firmly established from Canada to Chili, in a world unknown to t=
he ancients.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_618">But this inquiry, however useful or entertaini=
ng, is attended with two peculiar difficulties. The scanty and suspicious m=
aterials of eccesiastical history seldom enable us to dispel the dark cloud=
 that hangs over the first age of the church. The great law of impartiality=
 too often obliges us to reveal the imperfections of the uninspired teacher=
s and believers of the gospel; and, to a careless observer, <i>their</i> fa=
ults may seem to cast a shade on the faith which they professed. But the sc=
andal of the pious Christian, and the fallacious triumph <span class=3D"pb"=
><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"b=
racket">[</span>262<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> of the Infidel, =
should cease as soon as they recollect not only <i>by whom,</i> but likewis=
e <i>to whom,</i> the Divine Revelation was given. The theologian may indul=
ge the pleasing task of describing Religion as she descended from Heaven, a=
rrayed in her native purity. A more melancholy duty is imposed on the histo=
rian. He must discover the inevitable mixture of error and corruption which=
 she contracted in a long residence upon earth, among a weak and degenerate=
 race of beings.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_619">Our curiosity is naturally prompted to inquire=
 by what means the Christian faith obtained so remarkable a victory over th=
e established religions of the earth. To this inquiry, an obvious but satis=
factory answer may be returned; that it was owing to the convincing evidenc=
e of the doctrine itself, and to the ruling providence of its great Author.=
 But, as truth and reason seldom find so favourable a reception in the worl=
d, and as the wisdom of Providence frequently condescends to use the passio=
ns of the human heart, and the general circumstances of mankind, as instrum=
ents to execute its purpose; we may still be permitted, though with becomin=
g submission, to ask not indeed what were the first, but what were the seco=
ndary causes of the rapid growth of the Christian church. It will, perhaps,=
 appear that it was most effectually favoured and assisted by the five foll=
owing causes: I. The inflexible, and, if we may use the expression, the int=
olerant zeal of the Christians, derived, it is true, from the Jewish religi=
on, but purified from the narrow and unsocial spirit which, instead of invi=
ting, had deterred the Gentiles from embracing the law of Moses. II. The do=
ctrine of a future life, improved by every additional circumstance which co=
uld give weight and efficacy to that important truth. III. The miraculous p=
owers ascribed to the primitive church. IV. The pure and austere morals of =
the Christians. V. The union and discipline of the Christian republic, whic=
h gradually formed an independent and increasing state in the heart of the =
Roman empire.</p>

efence, but it was never designed for conquest; and it seems probable that =
the number of proselytes was never much superior to that of apostates. The =
divine promises were originally made, and the distinguishing rite of circum=
cision was enjoined, to a single family. When the posterity of Abraham had =
multiplied like the sands of the sea, the Deity, from whose mouth they rece=
ived a system of laws and ceremonies, declared himself the proper and, as i=

rated his favourite people from the rest of mankind. The conquest of the la=
nd of Canaan was accompanied with so many wonderful and with so many bloody=
 circumstances that the victorious Jews were left in a state of irreconcila=
ble hostility with all their neighbours. They had been commanded to extirpa=
te some of the most idolatrous tribes; and the execution of the Divine will=
 had seldom been retarded by the weakness of humanity. With the other natio=
ns they were forbidden to contract any marriages or alliances; and the proh=
ibition of receiving them into the congregation, which, in some cases, was =
perpetual, almost always extended to the third, to the seventh, or even to =
the tenth generation. The obligation of preaching to the Gentiles the faith=
 of Moses had never been inculcated as a precept of the law, nor were the J=
ews inclined to impose it on themselves as a voluntary duty. In the admissi=
on of new citizens, that unsocial people was actuated by the selfish vanity=
 of the Greeks, rather than by the generous policy of Rome. The descendants=
 of Abraham were flattered by the opinion that they alone were the heirs of=
 the covenant; and they were apprehensive of diminishing the value of their=
 inheritance, by sharing it too easily with the strangers of the earth. A l=

rophets was admitted, and even established, as the firmest basis of Christi=

, in compliance with the gross apprehensions of the Jews, had been more fre=
quently represented under the character of a King and Conqueror, than under=
 that of a Prophet, a Martyr, and the Son of God. By his expiatory sacrific=
e, the imperfect sacrifices of the temple were at once consummated and abol=
ished. The ceremonial law, which consisted only of types and figures, was s=
ucceeded by a pure and spiritual worship, equally adapted to all climates, =
as well as to every condition of mankind; and to the initiation of blood wa=
s substituted a more harmless initiation of water. The promise of divine fa=
vour, instead of being partially confined to the posterity of Abraham, was =
universally proposed to the freeman and the slave, to the Greek and to the =
barbarian, to the Jew and to the Gentile. Every privilege that could raise =
the proselyte from earth to Heaven, that could exalt his devotion, secure h=
is happiness, or even gratify that secret pride which, under the semblance =
of devotion, insinuates itself into the human heart, was still reserved for=
 the members of the Christian church; but at the same time all mankind was =
permitted, and even solicited, to accept the glorious distinction, which wa=
s not only proffered as a favour, but imposed as an obligation. It became t=
he most sacred duty of a new convert to diffuse among his friends and relat=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_643">Whatever opinion may be entertained of the mir=
acles of the primitive church since the time of the apostles, this unresist=
ing softness of temper, so conspicuous among the believers of the second an=
d third centuries, proved of some accidental benefit to the cause of truth =
and religion. In modern times, a latent, and even involuntary, scepticism a=
dheres to the most pious dispositions. Their admission of supernatural trut=
hs is much less an active consent than a cold and passive acquiescence. Acc=
ustomed long since to observe and to respect the invariable order of Nature=
, our reason, or at least our imagination, is not sufficiently prepared to =
sustain the visible action of the Deity. But, in the first ages of Christia=
nity, the situation of mankind was extremely different. The most curious, o=
r the most credulous, among the Pagans were often persuaded to enter into a=
 society which asserted an actual claim of miraculous powers. The primitive=
 Christians perpetually trod on mystic ground, and their minds were exercis=
ed by the habits of believing the most extraordinary events. They felt, or =
they fancied, that on every side they were incessantly assaulted by d=C3=A6=
mons, comforted by visions, instructed by prophecy, and surprisingly delive=
red from danger, sickness, and from death itself, by the supplications of t=
he church. The real or imaginary prodigies, of which they so frequently con=
ceived themselves to be the objects, the instruments, or the spectators, ve=
ry happily disposed them to adopt, with the same ease, but with far greater=
 justice, the authentic wonders of the evangelic history; and thus miracles=
 that exceeded not the measure of their own experience inspired them with t=
he most lively assurance of mysteries which were acknowledged to surpass th=
e limits of their understanding. It is this deep impression of supernatural=
 truths which has been so much celebrated under the name of faith; a state =
of mind described as the surest pledge of the divine favour and of future f=
elicity, and recommended as the first or perhaps the only merit of a Christ=
ian. <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: =

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_644">IV. But the primitive Christian demonstrated h=
is faith by his virtues; and it was very justly supposed that the divine pe=
rsuasion, which enlightened or subdued the understanding, must, at the same=
 time, purify the heart, and direct the actions, of the believer. The first=
 apologists of Christianity who justify the innocence of their brethren, an=
d the writers of a later period who celebrate the sanctity of their ancesto=
rs, display, in the most lively colours, the reformation of manners which w=
as introduced into the world by the preaching of the gospel. As it is my in=
tention to remark only such human causes as were permitted to second the in=
fluence of revelation, I shall slightly mention two motives which might nat=
urally render the lives of the primitive Christians much purer and more aus=
tere than those of their Pagan contemporaries, or their degenerate successo=
rs: repentance for their past sins, and the laudable desire of supporting t=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_645">It is a very ancient reproach, suggested by th=

by a sense of remorse, were easily persuaded to wash away, in the water of =
baptism, the guilt of their past conduct, for which the temples of the gods=
 refused to grant them any expiation. But this reproach, when it is cleared=
 from misrepresentation, contributes as much to the honour as it did to the=
 increase of the church.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/gibbon=

 After the example of their Divine Master, the missionaries of the gospel d=
isdained not the society of men, and especially of women, oppressed by the =
consciousness, and very often by the effects, of their vices. As they emerg=

The desire of perfection became the ruling passion of their soul; and it is=
 well known that, while reason embraces a cold mediocrity, our passions hur=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_648">There are two very natural propensities which =
we may distinguish in the most virtuous and liberal dispositions, the love =
of pleasure and the love of action. If the former be refined by art and lea=

t regard to economy, to health, and to reputation, it is productive of the =
greatest part of the happiness of private life. The love of action is a pri=
nciple of a much stronger and more doubtful nature. It often leads to anger=
, to ambition, and to revenge; but, when it is guided by the sense of propr=
iety and benevolence, it becomes the parent of every virtue; and, if those =
virtues are accompanied with equal abilities, a family, a state, or an empi=
re may be indebted for their safety and prosperity to the undaunted courage=
 of a single man. To the love of pleasure we may therefore ascribe most of =
the agreeable, to the love of action we may attribute most of the useful an=
d respectable qualifications. The character in which both the one and the o=
ther should be united and harmonised would seem to constitute the most perf=

ould be supposed alike destitute of both, would be rejected, by the common =

that mankind should be the most sensibly affected by such motives as were s=

 the practice of rigid virtue, and the constitution of the primitive church=

ver an undisciplined multitude, ignorant of the subject, and careless of th=

knowledged the supreme jurisdiction of the senate, of the college of pontif=
fs, and of the emperor, those civil magistrates contented themselves with t=
he easy task of maintaining, in peace and dignity, the general worship of m=
ankind. We have already seen how various, how loose, and how uncertain were=
 the religious sentiments of Polytheists. They were abandoned, almost witho=
ut control, to the natural workings of a superstitious fancy. The accidenta=
l circumstances of their life and situation determined the object, as well =
as the degree, of their devotion; and, as long as their adoration was succe=
ssively prostituted to a thousand deities, it was scarcely possible that th=
eir hearts could be susceptible of a very sincere or lively passion for any=
 of them.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_665">When Christianity appeared in the world, even =
these faint and imperfect impressions had lost much of their original power=
. Human reason, which, by its unassisted strength, is incapable of perceivi=

lly of Paganism; and, when Tertullian or Lactantius employ their labours in=
 exposing its falsehood and extravagance, they are obliged to transcribe th=
e eloquence of Cicero or the wit of Lucian. The contagion of these sceptica=
l writings had been diffused far beyond the number of their readers. The fa=
shion of incredulity was communicated from the philosopher to the man of pl=
easure or business, from the noble to the plebeian, and from the master to =
the menial slave who waited at his table, and who eagerly listened to the f=
reedom of his conversation. On public occasions the philosophic part of man=
kind affected to treat with respect and decency the religious institutions =
of their country; but their secret contempt penetrated through the thin and=
 awkward disguise; and even the people, when they discovered that their dei=
ties were rejected and derided by those whose rank or understanding <span c=

were accustomed to reverence, were filled with doubts and apprehensions con=
cerning the truth of those doctrines to which they had yielded the most imp=
licit belief. The decline of ancient prejudice exposed a very numerous port=
ion of human kind to the danger of a painful and comfortless situation. A s=
tate of scepticism and suspense may amuse a few inquisitive minds. But the =
practice of superstition is so congenial to the multitude that, if they are=
 forcibly awakened, they still regret the loss of their pleasing vision. Th=
eir love of the marvellous and supernatural, their curiosity with regard to=
 future events, and their strong propensity to extend their hopes and fears=
 beyond the limits of the visible world, were the principal causes which fa=
voured the establishment of Polytheism. So urgent on the vulgar is the nece=
ssity of believing that the fall of any system of mythology will most proba=
bly be succeeded by the introduction of some other mode of superstition. So=
me deities of a more recent and fashionable cast might soon have occupied t=
he deserted temples of Jupiter and Apollo, if, in the decisive moment, the =
wisdom of Providence had not interposed a genuine revelation, fitted to ins=
pire the most rational esteem and conviction, whilst, at the same time, it =
was adorned with all that could attract the curiosity, the wonder, and the =
veneration of the people. In their actual disposition, as many were almost =
disengaged from their artificial prejudices, but equally susceptible and de=
sirous of a devout attachment; an object much less deserving would have bee=
n sufficient to fill the vacant place in their hearts, and to gratify the u=
ncertain eagerness of their passions. Those who are inclined to pursue this=
 reflection, instead of viewing with astonishment the rapid progress of Chr=
istianity, will perhaps be surprised that its success was not still more ra=
pid and still more universal.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_681">The earliest mention of the Goths of which we =

 the references of such writers as Strabo and Pliny. (See M=C3=BCllenhoff, =
Deutsche Alterthumskunde, I.) His notice of the Goths is cited by Pliny, Na=
t. Hist. xxxvii. 2: <i>Pytheas Guttonibus Germaniae genti accoli aestuarium=
 Oceani Mentonomon nomine spatio sladiorum sex milia; ab hoc diei navigatio=
ne insulam abesse Abalum.</i> The names <i>Abalum</i> and <i>Mentonomon</i>=

 Nor is there any good ground for refusing to identify the <i>Gotones</i> o=

(See Hodgkin, Italy and her Invaders, vol. i. cap. i., to which I would ref=
er for a full discussion, as well as to Dahn=E2=80=99s K=C3=B6nige der Germ=
anen.)</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_682">Our chief source for the early history of the =
Goths is the Getica (or de origine actibusque Getarum) of Jordanes (whom it=
 was formerly usual to call Jornandes, a name which appears only in inferio=
r MSS.). Jordanes (a Christian name suggesting the river Jordan) was a nati=
ve of Lower Moesia, and lived in the sixth century in the reign of Justinia=
n. It is not quite certain to what nationality he belonged; but it is less =
probable that he was a genuine Goth or even a Teuton than that he was of Al=
anic descent. A certain Candac had led a mixed body of barbarians, Scyri, S=
adagarii, and Alans (see Get. l. 265) into Lower Moesia and Scythia; they h=
ad settled in the land, assimilated themselves to the surrounding Goths, an=
d adopted the Gothic name, more illustrious than their own. The grandfather=
 of Jordanes had been a notary of Candac, and Jordanes himself was secretar=
y of Candac=E2=80=99s nephew Gunthigis. This connection of the family of Jo=
rdanes with a family which was certainly not Gothic, combined with the name=
 of his father Alanoviimuthes, leads us to conclude that Jordanes was an Al=
an;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/gibbon-the-history-of-the-d=

and this was quite consistent with his being an ardent =E2=80=9CGoth.=E2=80=
=9D The small Alanic settlement of Moesia merged itself in the Gothic peopl=
e, just as the larger Alanic <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">=
Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>350<span cla=
ss=3D"bracket">]</span></span> population of Spain merged itself in the Van=
dalic nation. Beginning life as a scribe, Jordanes ended it as a monk (Geti=
ca, l. 266), perhaps as a bishop; it has been proposed to identify him with=
 a bishop of Croton who lived at the same time and bore the same name (Mans=
i, ix. 60).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_683">Jordanes wrote his Getica in the year 551. It =
was unnecessary for him to say that he had no literary training (<i>agramma=
tus</i>); this fact is written large all over his work. He states that his =
book was the result of a three days=E2=80=99 study of the Gothic History of=
 Cassiodorius, the learned minister of Theodoric. The fact is that the Geti=
ca is simply an abridgment of the larger work of Cassiodorius (in twelve bo=
oks); and modern critics (Usener, Hodgkin) not unreasonably question the =
=E2=80=9Cthree days=E2=80=9D of Jordanes. Thus, when we are dealing with Jo=
rdanes, we are really, in most cases, dealing with Cassiodorius; and the sp=
irit, the tendency, of Cassiodorius is faithfully reflected in Jordanes. To=
 praise the Gothic race, and especially the Amal line to which Theodoric be=
longed, was the aim of that monarch=E2=80=99s minister; Jordanes writes in =
the same spirit and echoes the antipathy to the Vandals which was expressed=
 by Cassiodorius. There are, however, also certain original elements in the=
 Getica. There is a significant contrast between the knowledge of the geogr=
aphy of the eastern provinces in the Balkan peninsula and the ignorance of =
the rest of the empire, which are displayed in this treatise. The stress la=
id on the institution of Gothic <i>foederati</i> may be attributed rather t=
o the Moesian subject of the empire than to the minister of the independent=
 Ostrogothic kingdom.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_684">One of the features of the lost work of Cassio=
dorius was the manufacture of an ancient history for the Goths by the false=
 identification of that race with the Getae and with the Scythians. The for=
mer confusion was suggested by the resemblance of name, the latter by the g=
eographical comprehensiveness of the term Scythia, which embraced all the p=
eoples of the North before they appeared on the scene of history. These fan=
ciful reconstructions are eagerly adopted by Jordanes.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_685">It may be well doubted whether Jordanes consul=
ted on his own account another writer on Gothic history, Ablavius (cp. Gibb=
on, chap. x. note 5), who is merely a name to us. He cites him with praise =
(iv. 28 and elsewhere); but there is little doubt that the laudatory refere=
nces are derived from Cassiodorius. On the other hand it may be supposed th=
at Jordanes, living among Goths, counting himself as a Goth, had some indep=
endent knowledge of old Gothic legends and songs to which he refers as ment=
ioned by Ablavius (<i>ib.</i> quem ad modum et in priscis eorum carminibus =
pene storico ritu, &amp;c.). The emigration of the Goths from Scandzia, the=
 island of the far north, their coming to the land of <i>Oium,</i> and batt=
le with the <i>Spali,</i> are not indeed historical, but are a genuine Goth=
ic legend; and stand on quite a different footing from the Getic and Scythi=
an discoveries of Cassiodorius.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_686">The other work of Jordanes, a summary of Roman=
 history (entitled de summa temporum vel origine actibusque gentis Romanoru=
m, usually cited as Romana), written partly before, partly after, the Getic=
a, does not concern us here. An account of the sources of both works will b=
e found in Mommsen=E2=80=99s exhaustive Pro=C5=93mium to his splendid editi=
on in the Monumenta Germani=C3=A6 historica (1882), from which for this bri=
ef notice I have selected a few leading points. The reader may also be refe=
rred to the clear summary and judicious discussion of Mr. Hodgkin in the in=
troduction and appendix to the first chapter of his Italy and her Invaders,=
 and to Mr. Acland=E2=80=99s article =E2=80=9CJordanes=E2=80=9D in the Dict=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_688">We cannot say with certainty at what period th=
e Gothic race was severed into the nations of East and West Goths. The ques=
tion is well discussed by Mr. Hodgkin, in Italy and her Invaders, chap. i. =
Appendix.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_689">The name Ostrogoth occurs first in the Life of=
 Claudius Gothicus in the Historia Augusta (written about the beginning of =
the fourth century), and next in Claudian, in Eutrop. ii. 153 (at the end o=
f the same century). Our first testimony to the existence of the Visigothic=
 name is later. In the fifth century Sidonius Apollinaris speaks of the Ves=
i in two places (Pan. in Avit. 456; Pan. in Major. 458). Is there any groun=
d for inferring that the Ostrogothic name is the older? It looks rather as =
if at first (c. 300-400) the distinction was between Ostrogoths and Goths; =
and that the name Visigoth was a later appellation.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_690">We must emphatically reject the view that Grut=
hungi and Thervingi were old names for Ostrogoths and Visigoths respectivel=
y and expressed the same distinction. Mr. Hodgkin has noticed the objection=
s supplied by the passages in the Vita Claudii and Claudian; and they are d=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_691">Valerian set out in 257, held a council of war=
 in Byzantium at the beginning of 258 (Hist. Aug. xxvi. 13). Thence he proc=
eeded to Cappadocia. The north coasts of Asia Minor were suffering at this =
time from the invasions of the Germans, and it has been conjectured that th=
ere may have been an understanding between the European and Asiatic enemies=
 of the Empire (as sometimes in later ages; as once before in the days of D=
ecebalus), and that Valerian aimed at preventing a junction of Persians and=
 Goths. <i>Vict. Parthica</i> on coins in 259 <span class=3D"sc"><span clas=

ere Valerian was captured is uncertain. Cedrenus says in C=C3=A6sarea (i. p=

ts=E2=80=9D has distinctly gone wrong. Two things are certain: (1) Sapor wa=
s twice at Antioch, and (2) Cyriades fell before Valerian. The first visit =
of the Persian monarch to Antioch was in the summer of 256, whither he was =
accompanied by Cyriades (also called Mariades, see M=C3=BCller, F.H.G. iv. =
p. 192), whom he had set up in that city as a Persian vassal. Antioch was w=
on back in the same year or in 257; Cyriades was torn to pieces by the inha=

ays proved superior. Their simultaneous appearance only illustrates vividly=
 the general disintegration of the Empire.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_694">It may be well, however, to add a few details,=
 chiefly references, to the succinct account of Gibbon. I take them in the =
order of his list.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_695">(1) Cyriades. See p. 44, and Appendix 3.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_696">(2) Macrianus. The generals Macrianus and Bali=
sta caused the two sons of the former, T. Fulvius Junius Macrianus and T. F=
ulvius Junius Quietus, to be proclaimed emperors (261 <span class=3D"sc"><s=
pan class=3D"entity ad">ad</span>;</span> see Hist. Aug. Vita Gall. 1, 2). =
It is a question whether Macrianus their father (he to whom Gibbon imputed =
the blame of Valerian=E2=80=99s disaster) assumed the purple also. There ca=
n, I think, be no doubt that he did not. We have (<i>a</i>) the negative ev=
idence that no coins which can be certainly ascribed to him and not to his =
son are forthcoming; (<i>b</i>) the story of his refusal in Hist. Aug. xxiv=
. 7-11; and (<i>c</i>) the positive statement of Zonaras, xii. 24. Against =
this we have to place the apparent statement in Hist. Aug. xxiii. 1, 2-4 (I=
 say apparent, because the passage is mutilated), and the clear statement i=
n xxiv. 12, 12, which is glaringly inconsistent with the immediately preced=
ing narrative. Macrianus is described as refusing the empire on the ground =
of old age and bodily weakness, and casting the burden on his sons. Balista=
, who had offered him the empire, agrees; and then the narrative proceeds: =
=E2=80=9CMacrianus promises (clearly in the name of his sons) a double dona=
tion to the soldiers and hurls threats against Gallienus; accordingly he wa=
s made emperor along with Macrianus and Quietus his two sons,=E2=80=9D as i=
f this were the logical outcome of the proceedings. From this evidence ther=
e can I think be only one conclusion.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_697">(3) Balista. He has even less claim than the e=
lder Macrianus to a place among the tyrants; like Macrianus he was only a t=
yrant-maker. Hist. Aug. xxiv. 12, 4, and 18.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_698">(4) Odenathus. The ground for placing Odenathu=
s among the tyrants seems to be that he assumed the title of king (Hist. Au=
g. xxiv. 15, 2) and that he had great power in the East. But a tyrant means=
 one who rebels against the true emperor and usurps the Imperial title. Ode=
nthaus never rebelled against Gallienus and never usurped the title Augustu=
s (=CE=A3=CE=B5=CE=B2=CE=B1=CF=83=CF=84=E1=BD=81=CF=82) or the title C=C3=
=A6sar. He supported the interests of Gallienus in the East and overthrew t=
he real tyranny which was set up by Macrianus. For his services Gallienus r=
ewarded him by the title of =CE=B1=E1=BD=90=CF=84=CE=BF=CE=BA=CF=81=CE=AC=
=CF=84=CF=89=CF=81 or <i>imperator,</i> an unusual title to confer, but not=
 necessarily involving Imperial dignity. (This title is enough to account f=
or the statement in Hist. Aug. xxiii. 12, 1.) As a king he held the same po=
sition that, for instance, Agrippa held under Claudius. An inscription of a=
 statue which two of his generals erected in his honour in 271 <span class=
=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> has been preserved (de V=
og=C3=BCe, Syrie centrale, p. 28) and there he is entitled king of kings. T=
his, as Schiller says (i. 838), should be decisive.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_699">(5) Zenobia. What applies to Odenathus applies=
 to Zenobia as far as the reign of Gallienus is concerned. She received the=
 title =CE=A3=CE=B5=CE=B2=CE=B1=CF=83=CF=84=CE=AE in Egypt, but not till af=
ter 271 and doubtless with the permission of Claudius.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_700">(6) Postumus. (See note 86, p. 25.) He made hi=
s residence at Trier, was acknowledged in Spain and Britain, and seems to h=
ave taken effective measures for the tranquillity and security of Gaul. In =
262 he celebrated his <i>quinquennalia</i> (Eckhel, vii. 438). His coinage =
is superior to that of the lawful emperors of the time; it did not pass cur=
rent in Italy, and the Imperial money was excluded from Gaul (Mommsen, R=C3=
=B6m. M=C3=BCnzwesen, 815). It is important to observe that Postumus was fa=
ithful to the idea of Rome. He was not in any sense a successor of Sacrovir=
, Vindex, and Classicus; he had no thought of an anti-Roman <i>imperium Gal=
liarum.</i></p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_701">(7) Lollianus. This is the form of the name in=
 our MSS. of his Life in <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edit=
ion: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>353<span class=
=3D"bracket">]</span></span> the Historia Augusta (xxiv. 5); his true name,=
 Cornelius Ulpianus Laelianus, is preserved on coins (Cohen, v. 60). In a m=
ilitary mutiny (268 <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span>,=
</span> in his fifth consulship) Postumus was slain and Laelianus elevated.=
 The new tyrant marched against the Germans, who had taken advantage of thi=
s struggle (<i>subita irruptione Germanorum</i>) to invade the empire and d=
estroy the forts which Postumus during the year of his rule had erected on =
the frontier; but he was slain by his soldiers, =E2=80=94 it is said, becau=
se he was too energetic, <i>quod in labore nimius esset</i> (Hist. Aug. xxi=
v. 5). Victorinus, who succeeded him, had probably something to do with his=
 death.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_702">(8) Victorinus. In 265 <span class=3D"sc"><spa=
n class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> Gallienus sent Aureolus to assert hi=
s authority in Gaul against Postumus. In the course of the war, an Imperial=
 commander M. Piauvonius Victorinus deserted to the tyrant, who welcomed hi=
m and created him C=C3=A6sar. Victorinus obtained supreme power after the d=
eath of Laelianus. He reigned but a few months; his death is noticed by Gib=
bon in chap. xi.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_703">Victoria or Victorina. The mother of Victorinu=
s (see chap. xi.). Her coins are condemned as spurious (Cohen, 5, 75).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_704">(9) Marius. M. Aurelius Marius; Eckhel, vii. 4=
54. According to Hist. Aug. xxiv. 8, 1, he reigned only three days after th=
e death of Victorinus. Perhaps he survived Victorinus by three days, but th=
ere can be no doubt that he arose as a tyrant, at an earlier date, perhaps =
immediately after the death of Postumus. If he had reigned only three days,=
 it is unlikely we should have his coins. Compare Schiller, i. 856.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_705">(10) Tetricus. (See chap. xi.)</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_706">(11) Ingenuus. His tyranny was set up in Panno=
nia and Moesia in the same year as that of Postumus in Gaul (258 <span clas=
s=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span>). He was defeated by Au=
reolus at Mursa =E2=80=94 the scene of the defeat of a more famous tyrant i=
n later times =E2=80=94 and slain, at his own request, by his shield-bearer=
.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_707">(12) Regillianus. A Dacian, who held the post =
of <i>dux</i> of Illyricum; his true name was Regalianus, preserved on coin=
s and in one MS. of the Historia Augusta. He had won victories against the =
Sarmatians, and his name, in its corrupt form, lent itself to the declensio=
n of <i>rex:</i> =E2=80=9Crex, regis, regi, Regi-lianus=E2=80=9D (Hist. Aug=
. xxiv. 10, 5). But his reign lasted only for a moment. His elevation was p=
robably due to disaffection produced by the hard measures adopted by Gallie=
nus in Pannonia when he suppressed the revolt of Ingenuus.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_708">(13) Aureolus. (See chap. xi.)</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_709">(14) Saturninus. Of him we know nothing. See H=
ist. Aug. xxiv. 23, and xxiii. 9, 1.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_710">(15) Trebellianus. See Hist. Aug. xxiv. 26; be=
yond what is stated there we know nothing. <i>Palatium in arce Isauriae con=
stituit.</i> He was slain by an Egyptian, brother of the man who slew =C3=
=86milianus, tyrant in Egypt; see below.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_711">(16) Piso. It is probably a mistake to include=
 Piso among the tyrants. He belonged to the party of Macrianus (see above),=
 who in 261 sent him to Greece to overpower the governor Valens. But a curi=
ous thing happened. Piso, who had come in the name of a tyrant, supported t=
he cause of the lawful emperor Gallienus (see Hist. Aug. xxiv. 21, 4), whil=
e Valens, who represented the cause of Gallienus, revolted, and became a ty=
rant himself. Both Piso and Valens were slain by their soldiers; =E2=80=94 =
the news of Piso=E2=80=99s death had reached Rome by the 25th June (Hist. A=
ug. <i>ib.</i> 3).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_712">(17) Valens. See last note.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_713">(18) =C3=86milianus. He threatened to starve t=
he empire, which depended for corn on Egypt. There are no genuine coins of =
this tyrant.</p>
<span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </spa=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_714">(19) Celsus. Elevated by the proconsul of Afri=
ca and the <i>dux limitis Libyci.</i> Hist. Aug. xxiv. 29.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_715">Of these nineteen, Macrianus, Balista, Odenath=
us, Zenobia, and Piso have no claim to be regarded as tyrants. But the plac=
es of Macrianus the father and Balista may be filled by Macrianus the son a=
nd Quietus. Thus the number nineteen is reduced to sixteen.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_716">It is worth noting that Pollio, who, as Gibbon=
 says, =E2=80=9Cexpresses the most minute anxiety to complete the number=E2=
=80=9D of the thirty tyrants, and as we have seen includes some who were ce=
rtainly not tyrants, should omit two names of rebels which are mentioned by=
 Zosimus. In i. 38 (ed. Mendelssohn) this historian says: =E1=BD=B2=CE=BD =

 of Memor we have a notice, in a fragment of the Anonymous Continuer of Dio=

 Theodotus recalls him who put to death =C3=86milianus and makes us think o=

. 83</span> <i>sqq.</i>)</h2>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_717">In regard to Gibbon=E2=80=99s account of the w=
ar of Aurelian with Zenobia, the following points are to be observed: =E2=
=80=94</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_718">(1) This war preceded the subjugation of Tetri=
cus and Gaul.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_719">(2) After her husband=E2=80=99s death Zenobia =
took the title =CE=B2=CE=B1=CF=83=CE=AF=CE=BB=CE=B9=CF=83=CF=83=CE=B1, and =
while her son Wahballath succeeded to his father=E2=80=99s position as <i>d=
ux Romanorum</i> and Lord of Palmyra, she really ruled. The name Wahballath=
, meaning <i>dea dedit,</i> was rendered in Greek by =E1=BC=88=CE=B8=CE=B7=
=CE=BD=CF=8C-=CE=B4=CF=89=CF=81=CE=BF=CF=82.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_720">(3) The story told by Gibbon from Hist. Aug. x=
xiii. 13, that Zenobia defeated a Roman army (under one Heraclian) is suspi=
cious (see Schiller, i. 859, note 1); for we find her on good terms with th=
e Roman government immediately after, and she recovers Egypt, which was und=
er the usurper Probatus, for Claudius, who was too much occupied with the G=
othic danger to proceed himself against the tyrant. Her son Wahballath gove=
rned in Egypt as the representative of Claudius, and the circumstance that =
he was officially named =CE=B2=CE=B1=CF=83=CE=B9=CE=BB=CE=B5=CF=8D=CF=82 do=
es not imply that he was a rebel.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_721">(4) Aurelian on his accession 270 <span class=
=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> recognised Wahballath as=
 vir consularis Romanorum Imperator dux Romanorum; he appeared beside Aurel=
ian on coins; and his mother assumed the title Augusta.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_722">(5) Wahballath began to issue coins without th=
e head of Aurelian and assumed the title Augustus. This seems to have been =
a consequence of an estrangement from the Emperor; but we do not know the i=
mmediate circumstances. The position which the Palmyrene family occupied wa=
s obviously inconsistent with the unity of the Empire.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_723">(6) The following stages may be marked in the =
course of the war: (<i>a</i>) Probus establishes the authority of Aurelian =
in Egypt, and the forces of Zenobia fail at Chalcedon; (<i>b</i>) Aurelian =
takes Ancyra and Tyana, and passes into Syria; (<i>c</i>) Zenobia=E2=80=99s=
 army is driven from Antioch, and (<i>d</i>) defeated at Emesa; (<i>e</i>) =
the surrender of Palmyra (early in 272); (<i>f</i>) its final destruction (=
spring 273).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_724">(7) Von Sallet, who has thrown much light on t=
his episode in his work <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Editi=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_725">As Gibbon notices, two statements are made in =
the Historia Augusta, as to the honourable provision which Aurelian made fo=
r Tetricus. In the Life of Tetricus (xxiv. 24, 5) we read: conrectorem <i>t=
otius Itali=C3=A6</i> fecit, id est, Campani=C3=A6, Samni, Lucani=C3=A6, Br=
ittiorum [Bruttii], Apuli=C3=A6, Calabri=C3=A6, Etruri=C3=A6 atque Umbri=C3=
=A6, Piceni et Flamini=C3=A6 omnisque annonari=C3=A6 regionis; but in the L=
ife of Aurelian (xxvi. 39, 1) Tetricum triumphatum correctorem <i>Lucani=C3=
=A6</i> fecit (so Aurel. Victor. &amp;c.). Both statements cannot be true, =
and Mommsen (Ephem. epig. i. 140) has proved that the first is to be accept=
ed and the second rejected.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_726">We find the idea of a governor of Italy in the=
 famous advice to Augustus which Dion Cassius (52, 21) puts in the mouth of=
 Maecenas. It is suggested that Italy beyond a circuit of a hundred miles f=
rom Rome should be governed like the provinces. But as early as 214 we find=
 C. Suetrius Sabinus, a consular, as <i>electus ad corrigendum statum Itali=
=C3=A6</i> (C.I.L. x. 5398) and at a later period Pomponius Bassus =E1=BC=
=90=CF=80=CE=B1=CE=BD=CE=BF=CF=81=CE=B8=CF=89=CF=84=E1=BD=B4=CF=82 =CF=80=
=CE=AC=CF=83=CE=B7=CF=82 =E1=BC=B8=CF=84=CE=B1=CE=BB=CE=AF=CE=B1=CF=82. See=
 further Mommsen, <i>loc. cit.,</i> and Staatsrecht, ii. 1086.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_727">Thus we find that correctors of all Italy were=
 occasionally appointed, during the third century. Therefore, Mommsen argue=
s convincingly (and it is a good instance of the application of a principle=
 of historical criticism), the notice that Tetricus was <i>corrector Itali=
=C3=A6</i> is the true one. For a later writer to whom correctors of Lucani=
a were perfectly familiar would never have changed a <i>corrector Lucani=C3=
=A6</i> into a <i>corrector Itali=C3=A6.</i></p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_728">The statement of Gibbon that Probus =E2=80=9Cc=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_731">It will be observed that the only statement of=
 fact is in the first passage, from which we learn that Probus constructed =

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_732">It is also to be noticed that the actual Wall,=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_746">The <span class=3D"csc">De Mortibus Persecutor=
um,</span> which was briefly noticed in vol. i. Appendix 1, calls for some =
further observations here. It always seemed clear that it was ascribed to L=
actantius before the end of the fourth century, and possible that L. C=C3=
=A6cilius (the name of the author in the unique MS. found at Moissac, and n=
ow in the Bibl. Nationale) might be a mistake for L. C=C3=A6lius, the name =
of Firmianus Lactantius; accordingly, fortified by the judgments of Teuffel=
 and Ebert, I am inclined (with Schiller, Burckhardt, and others) to accept=
 the identification, and suppose that the difference of style (justly notic=
ed by Gibbon, ch. xx. n. 40) may be explained by difference of subject. Yet=
 a study of the exhaustive investigation of Brandt might go far to convince=
 one that Lactantius was not the author of the Mortes, and that Gibbon=E2=
=80=99s hesitation was thoroughly justified. The arguments of Ebert, the ch=
ief champion of the Lactantian authorship (Ueber den Verfasser des Buches d=
e M. P., Ber. der s=C3=A4chs. Ges. der Wissensch., phil.-hist. Cl. 1870), h=
ave been assailed with force by Brandt, the greatest living authority on La=
ctantius, in his essay Ueber die Entstehungsverh=C3=A4ltnisse der Prosaschr=
. des Lact. und des Buches de M. P. (Sitzungsber. der Wiener Akad., vol. cx=
xv. Abh. vi. 1892).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_747">(1) There is a serious chronological argument,=
 which in itself (if the facts were correct) would be almost conclusive (fi=
rst urged by P. Meyer in Qu=C3=A6st. Lactant. particula prima, 1878). The a=
uthor of the Mortes was an eye-witness of the persecutions at Nicomedia, wh=
ere he wrote after the middle of 313 <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"enti=
ty ad">ad</span></span> (cp. xii. 2; xiii. 1; xxxv. 4; xlviii. 1; and xlvii=
i. 13; xlix.; lii. 4). But the Divine Institutions, which was finished befo=
re 310 (Brandt has shown, p. 12 <i>sqq.,</i> that it was almost certainly c=
ompleted in 307-8), though begun at Nicomedia, was finished at Trier, whith=
er Lactantius must have gone before 310. Therefore, the writer who describe=
s as an eye-witness the persecutions after 310 cannot have been Lactantius.=
</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_748">(2) There are peculiarities in style in the Mo=
rtes which cannot be explained by the nature of the subject; <i>e.g.,</i> =
=E2=80=9Cmore or less strong vulgarisms, Gr=C3=A6cisms, <span class=3D"pb">=
<span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"br=

ctantius writes correctly=E2=80=9D (p. 58, <i>e.g., misereri</i> with dat.,=
 <i>idolum,</i> &amp;c.).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_749">(3) Advocates of the Lactantian authorship app=
eal to numerous passages which are verbally identical with, or echoes of, p=
assages of Lactantius. But Brandt urges that these must be the work of an i=
nferior imitator, and are in fact a strong argument against the Lactantian =
authorship. Especially instructive is a comparison of Mort. xxxviii. 1 (whi=
ch Ebert is forced to regard as an interpolation) with Div. Inst. vi. 23, =
=C2=A7 10-12.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_750">(4) Brandt also insists that the author of the=
 Mortes (whose want of <i>bona fides</i> is glaringly exhibited in his exag=
gerated descriptions of Maximin=E2=80=99s lust, <i>e.g.,</i> or the cruelty=
 of Galerius; xxxviii. 4; xxi. 5) stands on a lower ethical level than the =
Lactantius whom we know from his undoubted writings.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_751">(5) The weak argument which rests on the fact =
that the Mortes is dedicated to =E2=80=9CDonatus confessor,=E2=80=9D and th=
at Lactantius inscribed his De Ira Dei to Donatus, is turned by Brandt into=
 an argument on the other side. While the mere identity of a most common na=
me proves nothing, what we know of the two Donati forbids the identificatio=
n. The Donatus of the Mort. was imprisoned in 305 (cf. 16; 35), and underwe=
nt the stress of the persecution; but the only thing that Lactantius has to=
 say to his Donatus is to warn him against trusting the authority of philos=
ophers. There is not a hint in the De Ira Dei that the person addressed was=
 undergoing imprisonment, which, whether the De Ira Dei was prior to 311 (a=
s Brandt has tried to show) or subsequent (as Ebert held), is an argument a=
gainst the identification of the two Donati.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_752">On the other hand the Mortes was ascribed to L=
actantius in the course of the fourth century, for Jerome had a copy in 393=
 <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span>,</span> on which do=
ubtless the name of Lactantius was inscribed; De Vir. Ill. c. 80, <i>habemu=
s</i> (I possess) <i>eius =E2=80=94 de persecutione librum unum.</i> And Br=
andt has corroborated this view of Jerome=E2=80=99s statement by showing th=
at the person who (c. 370 or not many years later) interpolated the Divine =
Institutions with the addresses to the Emperors (see Brandt, die Kaiseranre=
den, Sitzungsber. der W. Ak. 119, 1889), made use of the Mortes, supposing =
it to be Lactantian. This false ascription of the treatise, the work perhap=
s of a pupil of Lactantius, to Lactantius himself is accounted for by Brand=
t by the hypothesis that it was published anonymously, and the public, anxi=
ous to discover the authorship, were led by the Lactantianisms and the Nico=
median origin to fix on the wellknown writer of the Divine Institutions. <i=
>L. C=C3=A6cilii</i> would be, on this hypothesis, probably a mistak for L.=
 C=C3=A6lii (<i>i.e.</i> Lactantii), and not the name of the true author.</=
p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_753">As for the date (discussed by G=C3=B6rres in P=
hilologus, xxxvi. p. 597 <i>sqq.,</i> 1877), Brandt narrows it down to a sh=
ort period between the end of 314 <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity =
ad">ad</span></span> and the middle of 315 (p. 111). The Epitome of the Div=
ine Institutions (its Lactantian authorship has been vindicated, p. 2-10) w=
as used in the Mortes, and was written between the middle of 313 <span clas=
s=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> and the conclusion of t=
he Mortes. Seeck (who accepts from Idatius 316 as date of Diocletian=E2=80=
=99s death) makes the limits 317 and 321.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_754">On Brandt=E2=80=99s arguments I would observe =
that all except (1) have little cogency. (4) is especially weak; we have a =
much more glaring example of such inconsistency in the case of Procopius th=
e historian. In regard to (1), Seeck urges (Gesch. des Unterg. der ant. Wel=
t, p. 428) Jerome=E2=80=99s statement that L. taught Crispus as C=C3=A6sar,=
 <i>i.e.</i> after 317 <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</spa=

ave chosen a Christian preceptor for his son; in 308 Crispus was not more t=

>359<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> he could be in Nicomedia in 313=
; and the chief argument against the Lactantian authorship of the Mortes br=
eaks down. It may be added that no argument, except one favourable to the i=
dentification, can be based on the difference between the names in the MSS.=

I.L. 8, 7241); and Lactantius belonged to the African Diocese (Seeck, <i>ib=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_755">On the life of Lactantius see Brandt, Ueber da=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_756">To understand the historical work of <span cla=
ss=3D"csc">Eusebius</span> of C=C3=A6sarea, we must glance at the =E2=80=9C=
Chronographies=E2=80=9D of Sextus Julius Africanus, who flourished in the e=
arly part of the third century and wrote his chronographical work between 2=
12 and 221 <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> Al=
l that is known about him and his work will be found in the invaluable stud=
y of H. Gelzer, Sextus Julius Africanus und die byzantinische Chronographie=
 (1880). He is the founder of Byzantine chronography. His system is determi=
ned by the Jewish idea of a worldepoch of 6000 years; and he divides this i=
nto two parts at the death of Phalek. He is concerned to prove that the inc=
arnation took place in the year 5500 (=3D 2 <span class=3D"sc"><span class=
=3D"entity bc">bc</span></span>); after which there are 500 years of waitin=
g till the end of the world and the beginning of the millennium or the Worl=
d-Sabbath. The date of Moses was fixed at 1020 years before the first olymp=
iad by Justus of Tiberias, and this view, to which the apologist Justin gav=
e currency, is maintained by Africanus, who puts Moses in 3707-8 and the fi=
rst olympiad =3D first year of Ahaz in 4727-8. A contemporary of Africanus,=
 Hippolytus of Rome, also wrote a chronicle of the world, which Gelzer (ii.=
 23) designates as a very feeble performance, in erudition far inferior to =
that of Africanus.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_757">The chronicle of Eusebius, translated into Lat=
in by Jerome, threw that of Africanus into the background. Gelzer (ii. 42 <=
i>sqq.</i>) gives him the credit which he deserves for his excellent critic=
al discussion of the number of years between the Exodus and the building of=
 Solomon=E2=80=99s temple. Here we have a contradiction between St. Paul an=
d the Book of Judges on one hand, and the Books of Kings on the other. Euse=
bius does not hesitate to criticise the inspired numbers with masterly abil=
ity, just as if they occurred in profane documents, and rejects the stateme=
nt of the apostle Paul. =E2=80=9CIn later patristic literature we find noth=
ing similar. The Greek Church was perfectly speechless at the boldness whic=
h treated the chronological sketch of the apostle like that of a profane au=
thor=E2=80=9D (Gelzer, ii. 47).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_758">Again the historical instinct of Eusebius is s=
hown in the choice of his era. While Africanus began with Adam, this instin=
ct taught Eusebius that all Hebrew events before Abraham were =E2=80=9Cpreh=
istoric,=E2=80=9D and so he dated events by the years of Abraham, whom he p=
laces in 2017 <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity bc">bc</span>,</span=
> whereas the date of Africanus was 2300. But this was little compared with=
 his boldness in rejecting the received date of Moses, whom he placed in 15=

 1795 <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity bc">bc</span></span></p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_759">In the Ecclesiastical History, the Panegyric o=

was thus a <i>Gr=C3=A6cus</i> (xxxi. 16), though he wrote his history in La=
tin, which had become a second mother-tongue. His good birth and connection=
s gained him admission to the corps of the <i>domestici</i> (see vol. iii. =
App. 8). His military service probably lasted somewhat more than ten years.=
 We find him at Nisibis in 353 under Ursicinus (xiv. 9, 1). Next year he is=
 in the West; we catch him on the way to Milan (<i>ib.</i> 11, 5); and he g=
oes with other <i>protectores, domestici</i> and <i>tribuni</i> (<i>scholar=
um?</i>) on a mission to K=C3=B6ln (xv. 5, 2, and xviii. 8, 11). But in 357=
 he returns to the East, to the scene of the Persian war (xvi. 10, 21), and=
 Gibbon notices his escape from Amida. He went through Julian=E2=80=99s cam=
paign and probably retired from military service soon after the conclusion =
of the war by Jovian=E2=80=99s treaty (cp. Budinger, Ammianus Marcellinus u=

ecognised. For the Persian wars his account is not only that of a contempor=
ary but of an eye-witness. As to his sources for Julian=E2=80=99s German wa=
rs, see below. He was a pagan, but was not unjust to Christianity, of which=
 he speaks with respect, and, though an admirer of Julian, shows by a very =
strong expression his disapprobation of that Emperor=E2=80=99s measure whic=
h prohibited Christians from teaching (xxii. 10, 7). For his view of Christ=
ianity cp. xxi. 16, 18 (quoted by Gibbon) and xxii. 11, 5 (nihil nisi iustu=
m suadet et lene). His remarkable phrase about the founder of Christianity =
was unknown until A. von Gutschmid brilliantly restored a corrupt pasage, x=

<p class=3D"indent-no" id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_771">The name of the wise man, =
thus described, has disappeared from the MSS., and Valesius proposed to sub=
stitute <i>Platon</i> for <i>non.</i> But Gutschmid saw that the reference =

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_772">In connection with this passage I would hazard=
 a conjecture. I think that when Ammianus went out of his way to connect Je=
sus with Egypt, he had in mind a letter of Julian to the Alexandrians (Ep. =
li.), where the Emperor reproaches them for the prevalence of the Galilean =
superstition in their cities. The general theme of the letter is: What is A=
lexandria to Jesus or Jesus to Alexandria? The Ptolemies, he says (p. 557, =

>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_773">The attitude of Ammianus to internal ecclesias=
tical history has been well brought out by B=C3=BCdinger (<i>op. cit.</i> p=
. 15 <i>sqq.</i>). He declines to enter into the details of Christian contr=
oversies; his idea is that the Christians fight among themselves like wild =
beasts. =E2=80=94 His ideas of morality are high and strict; he believes in=
 progress and the enlightenment of his own age, cp. xviii. 7, 7. He has a h=
igh ideal of the Imperial authority. He shows towards the Germans a certain=
 bitterness which is never apparent in his treatment of the oriental nation=
s. That he was in a certain measure superstitious, notwithstanding his enli=
ghtenment, has been brought out by B=C3=BCdinger. A proneness to exaggerate=
 signs and portents may partly account for the extraordinary mistake in xx.=
 3, 1, where it is stated that in the east of the Empire there was an eclip=
se of the sun visible from dawn to noon, in 360 <span class=3D"sc"><span cl=
ass=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> (the month is not given), =E2=80=94 a to=
tal eclipse, for the stars were visible. In that year there was a total ecl=
ipse, but only visible in Australia; and there was also an eclipse in the a=
fternoon of 28th August, (1) visible in Asia but further east than the east=
 boundary of the Empire, and (2) partial, so that <i>intermicabant iugiter =
stell=C3=A6</i> could not apply to it. (Query: Did Ammianus, by a lapse of =
memory, set down under a wrong year the total eclipse of 4th June, 364 ?)</=
p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_774">One sharp criticism of Gibbon on Ammianus (see=
 below, chap. xxii. n. 6) is due, as Mr. Hodgkin has pointed out to me, to =
a misunderstanding. Ammianus <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">=
Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>364<span cla=
ss=3D"bracket">]</span></span> means in the passage in question that the tr=
oops were not to reach Persia, but to muster in Italy, at the beginning of =
spring.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_775">A reference must be made to the friendship of =
Ammian with his fellowcitizen and fellow-pagan Libanius. Their corresponden=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_776">For contemporary history Ammianus made use of =
the writings of Julian, the history of Eutropius and other sources. Much ha=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_777">(1) Libanius used all Julian=E2=80=99s writing=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_780">(4) Ammianus used two sources (as is shown by =
a number of contradictions and repetitions, and the fact that he sometimes =

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_786"><span class=3D"csc">Zosimus,</span> count and =

is not to be identified with either of his two contemporary namesakes, the =
grammarian of Ascalon or the sophist of Gaza. That he lived part of his lif=
e at Constantinople has been inferred from his accurate description of the =
city, ii. c. 30 <i>sqq.</i> Like Eunapius he was devoted to paganism, and h=
ostile to the Christian Emperors.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_787">Introducing his work by expressing his belief =
in a guiding providence in history, and appealing to the work of Polybius i=
n which the wonderful career of Rome was unfolded, Zosimus proceeds to give=
 a rapid sketch of Imperial history up to the death of Claudius (i. 1-46), =
and then begins, with the accession of Aurelian, a fuller narrative, coming=
 down to the siege of Rome by Alaric in 410. The author clearly intended to=
 continue his work to a later date; if the sixth book, of which there are o=
nly thirteen chapters, had reached the average length of the first five, it=
 would probably have ended with the death of Honorius. Between books i. and=
 ii. there is a great gap, corresponding to the reigns of Carus, Carinus, a=
nd Diocletian. We may conjecture that book ii. began with the accession of =
Diocletian.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_788">The important question of the sources of Zosim=
us has been acutely investigated by Mendelssohn (see Preface and Notes to h=
is edition). His results are briefly: (1) For chaps. 1-46, Zosimus used a l=
ost source, in which the account of the Gothic invasions was drawn from the=
 Scythica of Dexippus, but the Chronica of that writer was not consulted. T=
he hypothesis of an indirect use of the same source will explain the remark=
able agreements between Zonaras and Zosimus; and the identification of the =
source is bound up with the perplexed question of the <i>fontes</i> of Zona=
ras. (2) For the main body of the work Zosimus has chiefly relied on Eunapi=
us, as can be shown from the Eunapian fragments. Besides oracles, and one o=
r two passages of small importance, which he has taken from other sources, =
Mendelssohn makes it probable that the digression on the secular games at b=
eginning of book ii. was derived from Phlegon=E2=80=99s treatise on Roman F=
easts; and explains the agreements between Zosimus and Ammianus in the acco=

 It is important here to consult Sozomen, who used the same source.</p>

 by Photius in the ninth century; it can be proved that at the beginning of=
 the fourteenth century Nicephorus Xanthopulos had only this epitome and no=
t the complete work before him. (For the problem as to how far the epitome =
differs from the original, the study of J. R. Asmus, in Byz. Zeitsch. v. 30=
 <i>sqq.,</i> 1895, is suggestive.) The sources of Philostorgius, Socrates,=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_798">Hilgenfeld has developed his view as to the ri=
se of Gnosticism in his highly important work on early heresies, Die Ketzer=
geschichte des Urchristenthums. His position is that Gnosticism was founded=
 (as Iren=C3=A6us said) by the Samaritan, Simon the Magian, at the beginnin=
g of the Apostolic epoch, and thus arose strictly outside Christianity, but=
 yet within its atmosphere. Then it became in a way Christian, and deeply a=
ffected Christianity, both by breaking down Jewish Christianity, and by cal=
ling forth a combined opposition which led to the formation of a united Cat=
holic church. Hilgenfeld repeats and defends his theory in his Zeitsch. f=
=C3=BCr wissenschaftliche Theologie, vol. xxxiii. 1890, p. 1 <i>sqq.,</i> a=
gainst the different view put forward in Harnack=E2=80=99s Lehrbuch der Dog=
mengeschichte, vol. i. 1st edition, p. 178 <i>sqq.</i> Harnack holds that G=
nosticism arose from pre-Christian syncretistic religious theories (a =E2=
=80=9CReligionsmischung=E2=80=9D) which existed in Syria and especially Sam=
aria, and aimed at a universal religion. The Gnostics he describes as =E2=
=80=9Cthe theologians of the first century=E2=80=9D (p. 163); they took up =
Christianity at once as a universal religion and opposed it sharply to Juda=
ism and other religions. In Gnosticism, he says (following Overbeck), is re=
presented =E2=80=9Cdie acute Verweltlichung=E2=80=9D (Hellenisation) of Chr=
istianity, =E2=80=94 a result which was only obtained by a gradual process =
in Catholic Christianity.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_799">Harnack points out well (p. 172) that Gnostici=
sm was accompanied by a number of other sects, only partially related, whic=
h on one hand shade off into Hellenism, on the other to ordinary Christiani=
ty; <i>e.g.</i> Carpocratians and Encratites respectively. He deals at leng=
th with the peculiar position of Marcion, p. 197 <i>sqq.</i> [Cp. articles =
on Gnosticism and Marcion, in Dict. of Christian Biography.]</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_800">Harnack has since made a valuable contribution=
 to the study of Gnosticism by his work =E2=80=9CUeber das gnostische Buch =
Pistis Sophia=E2=80=9D (1891). He shows <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"d=

r than <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 302, a=
nd fixes it to the second half of the third century (p. 94 <i>sqq.</i>). He=
 shows that it was written in Egypt, but does not represent Valentinian doc=
trines (as had been supposed) but rather Ophite, if we use this elastic wor=
d to connote a whole group of Syrian gnostic heresies (Ophites, Nicolaites,=
 Sethites, Kainites, &amp;c.). He goes on to develop an attractive theory t=
hat the Pistis Sophia is identical with a treatise mentioned by Epiphanius =
(De H=C3=A6r. xxvi.) under the title of the Small Questions of Mary, as a w=

s, 1838, to the present day (of recent works, E. L=C3=B6ning=E2=80=99s Die =

Lightfoot and by Dr. Hatch; the latter in The Organisation of the Early Chr=
istian Churches (translated into German and edited by Harnack), 1880, doing=
 good service by pointing out resemblances with the organisation of religio=
us communities in the contemporary pagan world. The large literature relati=
ng to the Ignatian Letters is also directly concerned with the origin of ep=
iscopacy. The subject has been treated from a wider point of view by M. R=
=C3=A9ville in his Les origines de l=E2=80=99=C3=A9piscopat, vol. i. 1894, =
a work which throws light on many points. A very brief summary of his resul=
ts (though they are by no means incontestable) in regard to the episcopate =
will be appropriate.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_809">He throws aside the =CF=80=CF=81=CF=89=CC=82=

=A9 du christianisme primitif,=E2=80=9D the idea that in the early church t=
he institutions found in one community existed in all the others. Thus for =
Paul=E2=80=99s time the evidence of the Pauline epistles proves that there =
were episcopi at Philippi, but does not give the slightest reason to assume=
 such in Galatia. The episcopal functions were originally administrative an=
d financial [and liturgical]; and were distinct from the presbyteral functi=
ons, though often exercised by presbyters; the deacons were assistants of t=
he episcopi. Thus the current view that bishop and presbyter were originall=
y synonymous terms is, according to R=C3=A9ville, erroneous; it is only tru=
e in so far as the duties of instruction came to devolve on the bishops as =
well as the presbyters. (1) In the earliest documents we find a plurality o=
f bishops (and this is still the case at Corinth, when the Epistle of Cleme=
nt was written); (2) in the last years of the first century a single bishop=
 is becoming the rule in the churches of Asia Minor (cp. Pastoral Epistles)=
; (3) the third stage is the monarchical bishop, the ideal which Ignatius e=
xtolled in his Letters (which are certainly genuine) as the true remedy for=
 the disorders and divisions of the Eastern Churches, but which (the monarc=
hical, as distinguished from the =E2=80=9Cuninominal=E2=80=9D) was not yet =
(in the second decade of the second century), as his letters prove, a reali=
ty. For the organisation of the Christian community in Palestine, consult t=
he articles of Hilgenfeld in his Zeitschrift, vol. 33, 1890, p. 98 <i>sqq.,=
</i> and 223 <i>sqq.</i></p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_810">It may still be maintained that neither M. R=
=C3=A9ville nor any one else has satisfactorily explained how <i>bishop</i>=
 and <i>presbyter</i> came to be used interchangeably at any time, as in Ac=
ts xx. 28, and the 1st chap. of Titus.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-02_811">Gibbon considers the number of Christians at R=
ome to have been not more than one-twentieth of the population about the mi=
ddle of the third century, and he adopts the same proportion for the whole =
Empire. (This conclusion agrees with that of Friedl=C3=A4nder, Sittengeschi=
chte, iii. 531.) On the other hand, much higher proportions have been compu=
ted by more recent writers: St=C3=A4udlin, one-half; Matter, one-fifth; La =
Bastie, one-twelfth; while Chastel gives one-fifteenth for the West, and on=
e-tenth for the East. See Burckhardt, Die Zeit Constantins des Grossen, edi=
tion 2, p. 137. H. Richter (whose judgment in such a matter deserves partic=
ular consideration) reckons the Christians at one-ninth of the total popula=
tion (Westr=C3=B6misches Reich, 85, 86). But we have not sufficient data to=
 fix such accurate ratios; we may say that from Decius to Constantine the p=
roportion probably varied from about one-twentieth to one-ninth. Burckhardt=
, putting aside the question of numbers, finds the main strength of the Chr=
istians in their belief in immortality (p. 140).</p>

head of Gallienus has perplexed the antiquarians by its legend and reverse;=
 the former <i>Gallien=C3=A6 August=C3=A6,</i> the latter <i>Ubique Pax</i>=
 [Eckhel, vii. 413]. M. Spanheim supposes that the coin was struck by some =
of the enemies of Gallienus, and was designed as a severe satire on that ef=
feminate prince. But, as the use of irony may seem unworthy of the gravity =
of the Roman mint, M. de Vallemont has deduced from a passage of Trebellius=
 Pollio (Hist. August. p. 198) an ingenious and natural solution. Galliena =
was first cousin to the emperor. By delivering Africa from the usurper Cels=
us, she deserved the title of Augusta. [Recent authorities however accept t=
he explanation of Spanheim.] On a medal in the French king=E2=80=99s collec=
tion, we read a similar inscription of <i>Faustina Augusta</i> round the he=
ad of Marcus Aurelius. With regard to the <i>Ubique Pax,</i> it is easily e=

ome momentary calm. See Nouvelles de la R=C3=A9publique des Lettres Janvier=

 with regard to the place of Constantine=E2=80=99s birth. 1. Our English an=
tiquarians were used to dwell with rapture on the words of his panegyrist: =
=E2=80=9CBritannias illic oriendo nobiles fecisti.=E2=80=9D But this celebr=
ated passage may be referred with as much propriety to the accession as to =
the nativity of Constantine. 2. Some of the modern Greeks have ascribed the=
 honour of his birth to Drepanum, a town on the gulf of Nicomedia (Cellariu=
s, tom. ii. p. 174) which Constantine dignified with the name of Helenopoli=
s and Justinian adorned with many splendid buildings (Procop. de Edificiis,=
 v. 2). It is indeed probable enough that Helena=E2=80=99s father kept an i=
nn at Drepanum; and that Constantius might lodge there when he returned fro=
m a Persian embassy in the reign of Aurelian. But in the wandering life of =
a soldier, the place of his marriage, and the place where his children are =
born, have very little connection with each other. 3. The claim of Naissus =
is supported by the anonymous writer, published at the end of Ammianus, p. =
710 [Anonymous Valesii, 2], and who in general copied very good materials; =
and it is confirmed by Julius Firmicus (de Astrologi=C3=A2, l. i. c. 4), wh=
o flourished under the reign of Constantine himself. [Mathesis was the name=
 which the author himself, Julius Firmicus Maternus junior Siculus, gave to=
 this work in eight Books.] Some objections have been raised against the in=
tegrity of the text, and the application, of the passage of Firmicus; but t=
he former is established by the best MSS., and the latter is very ably defe=
nded by Lipsius de Magnitudine Roman=C3=A2, l. iv. c. 11, et Supplement.</p=

 canon, by the same churches of Asia to which it is addressed; and we may l=
earn from the complaint of Sulpicius Severus that their sentence had been r=
atified by the greater number of Christians of his time. From what causes, =
then, is the Apocalypse at present so generally received by the Greek, the =
Roman, and the Protestant churches? The following ones may be assigned. 1. =
The Greeks were subdued by the authority of an impostor who, in the sixth c=
entury, assumed the character of Dionysius the Areopagite. 2. A just appreh=
ension, that the grammarians might become more important than the theologia=
ns, engaged the Council of Trent to fix the seal of their infallibility on =
all the books of Scripture, contained in the Latin Vulgate, in the number o=
f which the Apocalypse was fortunately included (Fra Paolo, Istoria del Con=
cilio Tridentino, l. ii.). 3. The advantage of turning those mysterious pro=
phecies against the See of Rome inspired the Protestants with uncommon vene=
ration for so useful an ally. See the ingenious and elegant discourses of t=
he present bishop of Lichfield on that unpromising subject. [It may be cons=
