https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#Gibbon_0214-11_265</textarea></i><span class=3D"csc">After</span> the death of the lawful princes, the French and Venetians, confident of justice and victory, agreed to divide and regulate their future possessions.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_002" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_002_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> It was stipulated by treaty, that twelve electors, six of either nation, should be nominated; that a majority should choose the emperor of the East; and that, if the votes were equal, the decision of chance should ascertain the successful candidate. To him, with all the titles and prerogatives of the Byzantine throne, they assigned the two palaces of Boucoleon and Blachern=C3=A6, with a fourth part of the Greek monarchy. It was defined that the three remaining portions should be equally shared between the republic of Venice and the barons of France; that each feudatory, with an honourable exception for the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>2<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> doge, should acknowledge and perform the duties of homage and military service to the supreme head of the empire; that the nation which gave an emperor should resign to their brethren the choice of a patriarch; and that the pilgrims, whatever might be their impatience to visit the Holy Land, should devote another year to the conquest and defence of the Greek provinces. After the conquest of Constantinople by the Latins, the treaty was confirmed and executed; and the first and most important step was the creation of an emperor. The six electors of the French nation were all ecclesiastics, the abbot of Loces, the archbishop elect of Acre in Palestine, and the bishops of Troyes, Soissons, Halberstadt, and Bethlehem, the last of whom exercised in the camp the office of pope=E2=80=99s legate; their profession and knowledge were respectable; and, as <i>they</i> could not be the objects, they were best qualified to be authors, of the choice. The six Venetians were the principal servants of the state, and in this list the noble families of Querini and Contarini are still proud to discover their ancestors. The twelve assembled in the chapel of the palace; and, after the solemn invocation of the Holy Ghost, they proceeded to deliberate and vote. A just impulse of respect and gratitude prompted them to crown the virtues of the doge; his wisdom had inspired their enterprise; and the most youthful knights might envy and applaud the exploits of blindness and age. But the patriot Dandolo was devoid of all personal ambition, and fully satisfied that he had been judged worthy to reign. His nomination was overruled by the Venetians themselves; his countrymen, and perhaps his friends,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_003" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_003_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> represented, with the eloquence of truth, the mischiefs that might arise to national freedom and the common cause from the union of two incompatible characters, of the first magistrate of a republic and the emperor of the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>3<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> East. The exclusion of the doge left room for the more equal merits of Boniface and Baldwin; and at their names all meaner candidates respectfully withdrew. The marquis of Montferrat was recommended by his mature age and fair reputation, by the choice of the adventurers and the wishes of the Greeks; nor can I believe that Venice, the mistress of the sea, could be seriously apprehensive of a petty lord at the foot of the Alps.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_004" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_004_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> But the count of Flanders was the chief of a wealthy and warlike people; he was valiant, pious, and chaste; in the prime of life, since he was only thirty-two years of age; a descendant of Charlemagne, a cousin of the king of France, and a compeer of the prelates and barons who had yielded with reluctance to the command of a foreigner. Without the chapel, these barons, with the doge and marquis at their head, expected the decision of the twelve electors. It was announced by the bishop of Soissons, in the name of his colleagues: =E2=80=9CYe have sworn to obey the prince whom we should choose: by our unanimous suffrage, Baldwin, count of Flanders and Hainault, is now your sovereign, and the emperor of the East.=E2=80=9D He was saluted with loud applause, and the proclamation was re-echoed throughout the city by the joy of the Latins and the trembling adulation of the Greeks. Boniface was the first to kiss the hand of his rival, and to raise him on the buckler; and Baldwin was transported to the cathedral and solemnly invested with the purple buskins. At the end of three weeks he was crowned by the legate, in the vacancy of a patriarch; but the Venetian clergy soon filled the chapter of St. Sophia, seated Thomas Morosini on the ecclesiastical throne, and employed every art to perpetuate, in their own nation, the honours and benefices of the Greek church.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_005" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_005_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> Without delay, the successor of <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>4<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> Constantine instructed Palestine, France, and Rome of this memorable revolution.

After the flight of Mourzoufle, when the Latins were already in the city, he offered himself as their emperor to the soldiers and people; and his ambition, which might be virtuous, was undoubtedly brave. Could he have infused a soul into the multitude, they might have crushed the strangers under their feet; their abject despair refused his aid; and Theodore retired to breathe the air of freedom in Anatolia, beyond the immediate view and pursuit of the conquerors. Under the title, at first of despot, and afterwards of emperor, he drew to his standard the bolder spirits, who were fortified against slavery by the contempt of life; and, as every means was lawful for the public safety, implored without scruple the alliance of the Turkish sultan. Nice, where Theodore established his residence, Prusa and Philadelphia, Smyrna and Ephesus, opened their gates to their deliverer; he derived strength and reputation from his victories, and even from his defeats; and the successor of Constantine preserved a fragment of the empire from the banks of the M=C3=A6ander to the suburbs of Nicomedia, and at length of Constantinople. Another portion, distant and obscure, was possessed by the lineal heir of the Comneni, a son of the virtuous Manuel, a grandson of the tyrant Andronicus.

The Greeks, who had offered their service to their new sovereigns, were excluded by the haughty Latins<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_029" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_029_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">28</a> from all civil and military honours, as a nation born to tremble and obey. Their resentment prompted them to show that they might have been useful friends, since they could be dangerous enemies; their nerves were braced by adversity; whatever was learned or holy, whatever was noble or valiant, rolled away into the independent states of Trebizond, Epirus, and Nice; and a single patrician is marked by the ambiguous praise of attachment and loyalty to the Franks. The vulgar herd of the cities and the country would have gladly submitted to a mild and regular servitude; and the transient disorders of war would have been obliterated by some years of industry and peace. But peace was banished, and industry was crushed, in the disorders of the feudal system. The <i>Roman</i> emperors of Constantinople, if they were endowed with abilities, were armed with power for the protection of their <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>13<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> subjects; their laws were wise and their administration was simple. The Latin throne was filled by a titular prince, the chief, and often the servant, of his licentious confederates: the fiefs of the empire, from a kingdom to a castle, were held and ruled by the sword of the barons; and their discord, poverty, and ignorance extended their ramifications of tyranny to the most sequestered villages. The Greeks were oppressed by the double weight of the priest, who was invested with temporal power, and of the soldier, who was inflamed by fanatic hatred: and the insuperable bar of religion and language for ever separated the stranger and the native. As long as the crusaders were united at Constantinople, the memory of their conquest and the terror of their arms imposed silence on the captive land; their dispersion betrayed the smallness of their numbers and the defects of their discipline; and some failures and mischances revealed the secret that they were not invincible. As the fear of the Greeks abated, their hatred increased. They murmured; they conspired; and, before a year of slavery had elapsed, they implored or accepted the succour of a Barbarian, whose power they had felt, and whose gratitude they trusted.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_030" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_030_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">29</a></p>

The conspiracy was propagated by national hatred, the firmest band of association and secrecy: the Greeks were impatient to sheathe their daggers in the breasts of the victorious strangers; but the execution was prudently delayed, till Henry, the emperor=E2=80=99s brother, had transported the flower of his troops beyond the Hellespont. Most of the towns and villages of Thrace were true to the moment and the signal: and the Latins, without arms or suspicion, were slaughtered by the vile and merciless revenge of their slaves. From Demotica, the first scene of the massacre, the surviving vassals of the count of St. Pol escaped to Hadrianople; but the French and Venetians who occupied that city were slain or expelled by the furious multitude; the garrisons that could effect their retreat fell back on each other towards the metropolis; and the fortresses that separately stood against the rebels were ignorant of each other=E2=80=99s and of their sovereign=E2=80=99s fate. The voice of fame and fear announced the revolt of the Greeks and the rapid approach of their Bulgarian ally; and Calo-John, not depending on the forces of his own kingdom, had drawn from the Scythian wilderness a body of fourteen thousand Comans, who drank, as it was said, the blood of their captives, and sacrificed the Christians on the altars of their gods.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_032" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_032_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">31</a></p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_269">Alarmed by this sudden and growing danger, the emperor despatched a swift messenger to recall Count Henry and his troops; and, had Baldwin expected the return of his gallant brother, with a supply of twenty thousand Armenians, he might have encountered the invader with equal numbers and a decisive superiority of arms and discipline. But the spirit of chivalry could seldom discriminate caution from cowardice; and the emperor took the field with an hundred and forty knights, and their train of archers and serjeants. The marshal, who dissuaded and obeyed, led the vanguard in their march to Hadrianople; the main body was commanded by the count of Blois; the aged doge of Venice followed with the rear; and their scanty numbers were increased on all sides by the fugitive Latins. They undertook to besiege the rebels of Hadrianople; and such was the pious tendency of the crusades that they employed the holy week in pillaging the country for their subsistence, and in framing engines for the destruction of their fellow-Christians. But the Latins were soon interrupted and alarmed by the light cavalry of the Comans, who boldly skirmished to the edge of their imperfect lines; and a proclamation was issued by the marshal of Romania, that on the trumpet=E2=80=99s sound the cavalry should mount and form, but that none, under pain of death, should abandon themselves to a desultory and dangerous pursuit. This wise injunction was first disobeyed by the count of Blois, who involved the emperor in his rashness and ruin. The Comans, of the Parthian or Tartar school, fled before their first charge; but, after a career of two leagues, when the knights and their horses were almost breathless, they suddenly turned, rallied, and encompassed the heavy squadrons of the Franks. The count was slain on the field; the emperor was made prisoner; and, if the one disdained to fly, if the other refused to yield, their personal bravery made a poor atonement for their ignorance or neglect of the duties of a general.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_033" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_033_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">32</a></p>

They must inevitably have been destroyed, if the marshal of Romania had not displayed a cool courage and consummate skill, uncommon in all ages, but most uncommon in those times, when war was a passion rather than a science. His grief and fears were poured into the firm and faithful bosom of the doge; but in the camp he diffused an assurance of safety, which could only be realised by the general belief. All day he maintained his perilous station between the city and the Barbarians: Villehardouin decamped in silence at the dead of night; and his masterly retreat of three days would have deserved the praise of Xenophon and the ten thousand. In the rear the marshal supported the weight of the pursuit; in the front he moderated the impatience of the fugitives; and, wherever the Comans approached, they were repelled by a line of impenetrable spears. On the third day, the weary troops beheld the sea, the solitary town of Rodosto,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_034" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_034_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">33</a> and their friends, who had landed from the Asiatic shore.

But the savage Bulgarian was a stranger to the laws of war; his prisons were involved in darkness and silence; and above a year elapsed before the Latins could be assured of the death of Baldwin, before his brother, the regent Henry, would consent to assume the title of emperor. His moderation was applauded by the Greeks as an act of rare and inimitable virtue. Their light and perfidious ambition was eager to seize or anticipate the moment of a vacancy, while a law of succession, the guardian both of the prince and people, was gradually defined and confirmed in the hereditary monarchies of Europe. In the support of the Eastern empire Henry was gradually left without an associate, as the heroes of the crusade retired from the world or from the war. The doge of Venice, the venerable Dandolo, in the fulness of years and glory, sunk into the grave. The marquis of Montferrat was slowly recalled from the Peloponnesian war to the revenge of Baldwin and the defence of Thessalonica. Some nice disputes of feudal homage and service were reconciled in a personal interview between the emperor and the king; they were firmly united by mutual esteem and the common danger; and their alliance was sealed by the nuptial of Henry with the daughter of the Italian prince. He soon deplored the loss of his friend and father. At the persuasion of some faithful Greeks, Boniface made a bold and successful inroad among the hills of Rhodope: the Bulgarians fled on his approach; they assembled to harass his retreat. On the intelligence that his rear was attacked, without waiting for any defensive armour, he leaped on horseback, couched his lance, and drove the enemies before him; but in the rash pursuit he was pierced with a mortal wound; and the head of the king of Thessalonica was presented to Calo-John, who enjoyed the honours, without the merit, of victory. It is here, at this melancholy event, that the pen or the voice of Jeffrey of Villehardouin <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>19<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> seems to drop or to expire;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_038" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_038_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">37</a> and, if he still exercised his military office of marshal of Romania, his subsequent exploits are buried in oblivion.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_039" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_039_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">38</a> The character of Henry was not unequal to his arduous situation: in the siege of Constantinople, and beyond the Hellespont, he had deserved the fame of a valiant knight and a skilful commander; and his courage was tempered with a degree of prudence and mildness unknown to his impetuous brother. In the double war against the Greeks of Asia and the Bulgarians of Europe, he was ever the foremost on shipboard or on horseback; and, though he cautiously provided for the success of his arms, the drooping Latins were often roused by his example to save and to second their fearless emperor. But such efforts, and some supplies of men and money from France, were of less avail than the errors, the cruelty, and the death of their most formidable adversary. When the despair of the Greek subjects invited Calo-John as their deliverer, they hoped that he would protect their liberty and adopt their laws; they were soon taught to compare the degrees of national ferocity, and to execrate the savage conqueror, who no longer dissembled his intention of dispeopling Thrace, of demolishing the cities, and of transplanting the inhabitants beyond the Danube. Many towns and villages of Thrace were already evacuated; an heap of ruins marked the place of Philippopolis, and a similar calamity was expected at Demotica and Hadrianople by the first authors of the revolt. They raised a cry of grief and repentance <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>20<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> to the throne of Henry; the emperor alone had the magnanimity to forgive and trust them. No more than four hundred knights, with their serjeants and archers, could be assembled under his banner; and with this slender force he fought and repulsed the Bulgarian, who, besides his infantry, was at the head of forty thousand horse. In this expedition, Henry felt the difference between an hostile and a friendly country; the remaining cities were preserved by his arms; and the savage, with shame and loss, was compelled to relinquish his prey. The siege of Thessalonica was the last of the evils which Calo-John inflicted or suffered; he was stabbed in the night in his tent; and the general, perhaps the assassin, who found him weltering in his blood, ascribed the blow, with general applause, to the lance of St. Demetrius.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_040" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_040_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">39</a> After several victories the prudence of Henry concluded an honourable peace with the successor of the tyrant, and with the Greek princes of Nice and Epirus. If he ceded some doubtful limits, an ample kingdom was reserved for himself and his feudatories; and his reign, which lasted only ten years, afforded a short interval of prosperity and peace. Far above the narrow policy of Baldwin and Boniface, he freely entrusted to the Greeks the most important offices of the state and army; and this liberality of sentiment and practice was the more seasonable, as the princes of Nice and Epirus had already learned to seduce and employ the mercenary valour of the Latins. It was the aim of Henry to unite and reward his deserving subjects of every nation and language; but he appeared less solicitous to accomplish the impracticable union of the two churches. Pelagius, the pope=E2=80=99s legate, who acted as the sovereign of Constantinople, had interdicted the worship of the Greeks, and sternly imposed the payment of tithes, the double procession of the Holy Ghost, and a blind <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>21<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> obedience to the Roman pontiff.

His valour was a vulgar attribute which he shared with ten thousand knights; but Henry possessed the superior courage to oppose, in a superstitious age, the pride and avarice of the clergy. In the cathedral of St. Sophia, he presumed to place his throne on the right hand of the patriarch; and this presumption excited the sharpest censure of Pope Innocent the Third.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_042" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_042_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">41</a> By a salutary edict, one of the first examples of the laws of mortmain, he prohibited the alienation of fiefs; many of the Latins, desirous of returning to Europe, resigned their estates to the church for a spiritual or temporal reward; these holy lands were immediately discharged from military service; and a colony of soldiers would have been gradually transformed into a college of priests.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_043" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_043_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">42</a></p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_272">The virtuous Henry died at Thessalonica, in the defence of that kingdom, and of an infant, the son of his friend Boniface. In the two first emperors of Constantinople, the male line of the counts of Flanders was extinct. But their sister Yolande was the wife of a French prince, the mother of a numerous progeny; and one of her daughters had married Andrew, king of Hungary, a brave and pious champion of the cross. By <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>22<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> seating him on the Byzantine throne, the barons of Romania would have acquired the forces of a neighbouring and warlike kingdom; but the prudent Andrew revered the laws of succession; and the princess Yolande, with her husband, Peter of Courtenay, count of Auxerre, was invited by the Latins to assume the empire of the East. The royal birth of his father, the noble origin of his mother, recommended to the barons of France the first-cousin of their king. His reputation was fair, his possessions were ample, and in the bloody crusade against the Albigeois the soldiers and the priests had been abundantly satisfied of his zeal and valour. Vanity might applaud the elevation of a French emperor of Constantinople; but prudence must pity, rather than envy, his treacherous and imaginary greatness. To assert and adorn his title, he was reduced to sell or mortgage the best of his patrimony. By these expedients, the liberality of his royal kinsman, Philip Augustus, and the national spirit of chivalry, he was enabled to pass the Alps at the head of one hundred and forty knights and five thousand five hundred serjeants and archers. After some hesitation, Pope Honorius the Third was persuaded to crown the successor of Constantine; but he performed the ceremony in a church without the walls, lest he should seem to imply, or to bestow, anyright of sovereignty over the ancient capital of the empire. The Venetians had engaged to transport Peter and his forces beyond the Adriatic, and the empress, with her four children, to the Byzantine palace; but they required, as the price of their service, that he should recover Durazzo from the despot of Epirus. Michael Angelus, or Comnenus, the first of his dynasty, had bequeathed the succession of his power and ambition to Theodore, his legitimate brother, who already threatened and invaded the establishments of the Latins. After discharging his debt by a fruitless assault, the emperor raised the siege to prosecute a long and perilous journey over land from Durazzo to Thessalonica. He was soon lost in the mountains of Epirus; the passes were fortified; his provisions exhausted; he was delayed and <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>23<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> deceived by a treacherous negotiation; and, after Peter of Courtenay and the Roman legate had been arrested in a banquet, the French troops, without leaders or hopes, were eager to exchange their arms for the delusive promise of mercy and bread. The Vatican thundered; and the impious Theodore was threatened with the vengeance of earth and heaven; but the captive emperor and his soldiers were forgotten, and the reproaches of the pope are confined to the imprisonment of his legate. No sooner was he satisfied by the deliverance of the priest and a promise of spiritual obedience, than he pardoned and protected the despot of Epirus. His peremptory commands suspended the ardour of the Venetians and the king of Hungary; and it was only by a natural or untimely death<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_044" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_044_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">43</a> that Peter of Courtenay was released from his hopeless captivity.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_045" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_045_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">44</a></p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_273">The long ignorance of his fate, and the presence of the lawful sovereign, of Yolande, his wife or widow, delayed the proclamation of a new emperor. Before her death, and in the midst of her grief, she was delivered of a son, who was named Baldwin, the last and most unfortunate of the Latin princes of Constantinople. His birth endeared him to the barons of Romania; but his childhood would have prolonged the troubles of a minority, and his claims were superseded by the elder claims of his brethren. The first of these, Philip of Courtenay, who derived from his mother the inheritance of Namur, had the wisdom to prefer the substance of a marquisate to the shadow of an empire; and on his refusal, Robert, the second of the sons of Peter and Yolande, was called to the throne of Constantinople. Warned by his <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>24<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> father=E2=80=99s mischance, he pursued his slow and secure journey through Germany and along the Danube; a passage was opened by his sister=E2=80=99s marriage with the king of Hungary; and the emperor Robert was crowned by the patriarch in the cathedral of St. Sophia. But his reign was an era of calamity and disgrace; and the colony, as it was styled, of <span class=3D"csc">New France</span> yielded on all sides to the Greeks of Nice and Epirus. After a victory, which he owed to his perfidy rather than his courage, Theodore Angelus entered the kingdom of Thessalonica, expelled the feeble Demetrius, the son of the marquis Boniface, erected his standard on the walls of Hadrianople, and added, by his vanity, a third or fourth name to the list of rival emperors. The relics of the Asiatic province were swept away by John Vataces, the son-in-law and successor of Theodore Lascaris, and who, in a triumphant reign of thirty-three years, displayed the virtues both of peace and war. Under his discipline, the swords of the French mercenaries were the most effectual instrument of his conquests, and their desertion from the service of their country was at once a symptom and a cause of the rising ascendant of the Greeks. By the construction of a fleet he obtained the command of the Hellespont, reduced the islands of Lesbos and Rhodes,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_046" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_046_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">45</a> attacked the Venetians of Candia, and intercepted the rare and parsimonious succours of the West. Once, and once only, the Latin emperor sent an army against Vataces; and, in the defeat of that army, the veteran knights, the last of the original conquerors, were left on the field of battle. But the success of a foreign enemy was less painful to the pusillanimous Robert than the insolence of his Latin subjects, who confounded the weakness of the emperor and of the empire. His personal misfortunes will prove the anarchy of the government and the ferociousness of the times. The amorous youth had neglected his Greek <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>25<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> bride, the daughter of Vataces, to introduce into the palace a beautiful maid, of a private, though noble, family of Artois; and her mother had been tempted by the lustre of the purple to forfeit her engagements with a gentleman of Burgundy. His love was converted into rage; he assembled his friends, forced the palace gates, threw the mother into the sea, and inhumanly cut off the nose and lips of the wife or concubine of the emperor. Instead of punishing the offender, the barons avowed and applauded the savage deed,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_047" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_047_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">46</a> which, as a prince and as a man, it was impossible that Robert should forgive. He escaped from the guilty city to implore the justice or compassion of the pope; the emperor was coolly exhorted to return to his station; before he could obey, he sunk under the weight of grief, shame, and impotent resentment.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_048" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_048_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">47</a></p>

He thrice repeated these mendicant visits, in which he seemed to prolong his stay and postpone his return; of the five-and-twenty years of his reign, a greater number were spent abroad than at home; and in no place did the emperor deem himself less free and secure than in his native country and his capital.

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_276">But in this abject distress the emperor and empire were still possessed of an ideal treasure, which drew its fantastic value from the superstition of the Christian world. The merit of the true cross was somewhat impaired by its frequent division; and a long captivity among the infidels might shed some suspicion on the fragments that were produced in the East and West. But another relic of the Passion was preserved in the Imperial chapel of Constantinople; and the crown of thorns, which had been placed on the head of Christ, was equally precious and authentic. It had formerly been the practice of the Egyptian debtors to deposit, as a security, the mummies of their parents; and both their honour and religion were bound for the redemption of the pledge. In the same manner, and in the absence of the emperor, the barons of Romania borrowed the sum of thirteen thousand one hundred and thirty-four <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>31<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> pieces of gold,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_064" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_064_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">63</a> on the credit of the holy crown; they failed in the performance of their contract; and a rich Venetian, Nicholas Querini, undertook to satisfy their impatient creditors, on condition that the relic should be lodged at Venice, to become his absolute property if it were not redeemed within a short and definite term. The barons apprised their sovereign of the hard treaty and impending loss; and, as the empire could not afford a ransom of seven thousand pounds sterling, Baldwin was anxious to snatch the prize from the Venetians, and to vest it with more honour and emolument in the hands of the most Christian king.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_065" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_065_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">64</a> Yet the negotiation was attended with some delicacy. In the purchase of relics, the saint would have started at the guilt of simony; but, if the mode of expression were changed, he might lawfully repay the debt, accept the gift, and acknowledge the obligation. His ambassadors, two Dominicans, were despatched to Venice, to redeem and receive the holy crown, which had escaped the dangers of the sea and the galleys of Vataces. On opening a wooden box, they recognised the seals of the doge and barons, which were applied on a shrine of silver; and within this shrine the monument of the Passion was enclosed in a golden vase. The reluctant Venetians yielded to justice and power; the emperor Frederic granted a free and honourable passage; the court of France advanced as far as Troyes in Champagne, to meet with devotion this inestimable relic; it was borne in triumph through Paris by the king himself, barefoot, and in his shirt; and a free gift of ten thousand marks of silver reconciled Baldwin to his loss. The success of this transaction tempted the Latin emperor to <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>32<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> offer with the same generosity the remaining furniture of his chapel:<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_066" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_066_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">65</a> a large and authentic portion of the true cross; the baby-linen of the Son of God; the lance, the spunge, and the chain of his Passion; the rod of Moses; and part of the scull of St. John the Baptist. For the reception of these spiritual treasures, twenty thousand marks were expended by St. Louis on a stately foundation, the holy chapel of Paris, on which the muse of Boileau has bestowed a comic immortality. The truth of such remote and ancient relics, which cannot be proved by any human testimony, must be admitted by those who believe in the miracles which they have performed. About the middle of the last age, an inveterate ulcer was touched and cured by an holy prickle of the holy crown:<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_067" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_067_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">66</a> the prodigy is attested by the most pious and enlightened Christians of France; nor will the fact be easily disproved, except by those who are armed with a general antidote against religious credulity.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_068" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_068_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">67</a></p>

From the Propontis to the rocky coast of Pamphylia, Asia was peaceful and prosperous under his reign; and the events of every campaign extended his influence in Europe. The strong cities of the hills of Macedonia and Thrace were rescued from the Bulgarians; and their kingdom was circumscribed by its present and proper limits, along the southern banks of the Danube. The sole emperor of the Romans could no longer brook that a lord of Epirus, a Comnenian prince of the West, should presume to dispute or share the honours of the purple; and the humble Demetrius changed the colour of his buskins, and accepted with gratitude the appellation of despot. His own subjects were exasperated by his baseness and incapacity: they implored the protection of their supreme lord. After some resistance, the kingdom of Thessalonica was united to the empire of Nice;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_070" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_070_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">69</a> and Vataces reigned without a competitor from the Turkish borders to the Adriatic gulf. The princes of Europe revered his merit and power; and, had he subscribed an orthodox creed, it should seem that the pope would have abandoned without reluctance the Latin throne of Constantinople. But the death of Vataces, the short and busy reign of Theodore his son, and the helpless infancy of his grandson John suspended the restoration of the Greeks. <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>34<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> In the next chapter I shall explain their domestic revolutions; in this place it will be sufficient to observe that the young prince was oppressed by the ambition of his guardian and colleague, Michael Pal=C3=A6ologus, who displayed the virtues and vices that belong to the founder of a new dynasty. The emperor Baldwin had flattered himself that he might recover some provinces or cities by an impotent negotiation. His ambassadors were dismissed from Nice with mockery and contempt. At every place which they named, Pal=C3=A6ologus alleged some special reason which rendered it dear and valuable in his eyes: in the one he was born; in another he had been first promoted to military command; and in a third he had enjoyed, and hoped long to enjoy, the pleasures of the chase. =E2=80=9CAnd what, then, do you propose to give us?=E2=80=9D said the astonished deputies. =E2=80=9CNothing,=E2=80=9D replied the Greek, =E2=80=9Cnot a foot of land.

The weakness of Constantinople, and the distress and terror of the Latins, were familiar to the observation of the volunteers; and they represented the present moment as the most propitious to surprise and conquest. A rash youth, the new governor of the Venetian colony, had sailed away with thirty galleys and the best of the French knights, on a wild expedition to Daphnusia, a town on the Black Sea, at a distance of forty leagues;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_080" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_080_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">79</a> and the remaining Latins were without strength or suspicion.

Whilst the C=C3=A6sar kept his regulars in firm array, the Comans dispersed themselves on all sides; an alarm was sounded, and the threats of fire and pillage compelled the citizens to a decisive resolution. The Greeks of Constantinople remembered their native sovereigns; the Genoese merchants, their recent alliance and Venetian foes; every quarter was in arms; and the air resounded with a general acclamation of =E2=80=9CLong life and victory to Michael and John, the august emperors of the Romans!=E2=80=9D Their rival Baldwin was awakened by the sound; but the most pressing danger could not prompt him to draw his sword in the defence of a city which he deserted, perhaps, with more pleasure than regret: he fled from the palace to the sea-shore, where he descried the welcome sails of the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>38<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> fleet returning from the vain and fruitless attempt on Daphnusia. Constantinople was irrecoverably lost; but the Latin emperor and the principal families embarked on board the Venetian galleys, and steered for the isle of Eub=C5=93a, and afterwards for Italy, where the royal fugitive was entertained by the pope and Sicilian king with a mixture of contempt and pity. From the loss of Constantinople to his death, he consumed thirteen years, soliciting the Catholic powers to join in his restoration: the lesson had been familiar to his youth; nor was his last exile more indigent or shameful than his three former pilgrimages to the courts of Europe. His son Philip was the heir of an ideal empire; and the pretensions of <i>his</i> daughter Catherine were transported by her marriage to Charles of Valois, the brother of Philip the Fair, king of France. The house of Courtenay was represented in the female line by successive alliances, till the title of emperor of Constantinople, too bulky and sonorous for a private name, modestly expired in silence and oblivion.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_083" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_083_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">82</a></p>

In the efforts for the recovery of their empire they emulated the valour, discipline, and tactics of their antagonists. The modern literature of the West they might justly despise; but its free spirit would instruct them in the rights of man; and some institutions of public and private life were adopted from the French.

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_280">If we compare, at the era of the crusades, the Latins of Europe with the Greeks and Arabians, their respective degrees of knowledge, industry, and art, our rude ancestors must be content with the third rank in the scale of nations. Their successive improvement and present superiority may be ascribed to a peculiar energy of character, to an active and imitative spirit, unknown to their more polished rivals, who at that time were in a stationary or retrograde state. With such a disposition, the Latins should have derived the most early and essential benefits from a series of events which <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>40<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> opened to their eyes the prospect of the world, and introduced them to a long and frequent intercourse with the more cultivated regions of the East. The first and most obvious progress was in trade and manufactures, in the arts which are strongly prompted by the thirst of wealth, the calls of necessity, and the gratification of the sense or vanity. Among the crowd of unthinking fanatics, a captive or a pilgrim might sometimes observe the superior refinements of Cairo and Constantinople: the first importer of windmills<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_086" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_086_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">85</a> was the benefactor of nations; and, if such blessings are enjoyed without any grateful remembrance, history has condescended to notice the more apparent luxuries of silk and sugar, which were transported into Italy from Greece and Egypt. But the intellectual wants of the Latins were more slowly felt and supplied; the ardour of studious curiosity was awakened in Europe by different causes and more recent events; and, in the age of the crusades, they viewed with careless indifference the literature of the Greeks and Arabians. Some rudiments of mathematical and medicinal knowledge might be imparted in practice and in figures; necessity might produce some interpreters for the grosser business of merchants and soldiers; but the commerce of the Orientals had not diffused the study and knowledge of their languages in the schools of Europe.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_087" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_087_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">86</a> If a similar principle of religion repulsed the idiom of the Koran, it should have excited their patience and curiosity to understand the original text of the gospel; and the same grammar would have unfolded the sense of Plato and the beauties of Homer. Yet in a reign of sixty years, the Latins of Constantinople disdained the speech and learning of their subjects; and the manuscripts were the only <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>41<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> treasures which the natives might enjoy without rapine or envy. Aristotle was indeed the oracle of the Western universities; but it was a Barbarous Aristotle; and, instead of ascending to the fountain-head, his Latin votaries humbly accepted a corrupt and remote version from the Jews and Moors of Andalusia. The principle of the crusades was a savage fanaticism; and the most important effects were analogous to the cause. Each pilgrim was ambitious to return with his sacred spoils, the relics of Greece and Palestine;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_088" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_088_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">87</a> and each relic was preceded and followed by a train of miracles and visions. The belief of the Catholics was corrupted by new legends, their practice by new superstitions; and the establishment of the inquisition, the mendicant orders of monks and friars, the last abuse of indulgences, and the final progress of idolatry flowed from the baleful fountain of the holy war. The active spirit of the Latins preyed on the vitals of their reason and religion; and, if the ninth and tenth centuries were the times of darkness, the thirteenth and fourteenth were the age of absurdity and fable.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_281">In the profession of Christianity, in the cultivation of a fertile land, the Northern conquerors of the Roman empire insensibly mingled with the provincials and rekindled the embers of the arts of antiquity.

Great was the success, and rapid the progress, during the two hundred years of the crusades; and some philosophers have applauded the propitious influence of these holy wars, which appear to me to have checked, rather than forwarded, the maturity of Europe.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_090" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_090_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">89</a> The lives and labours of millions, which were buried in the East, would have been more profitably employed in the improvement of their native country: the accumulated stock of industry and wealth would have overflowed in navigation and trade; and the Latins would have been enriched and enlightened by a pure and friendly correspondence with the climates of the East. In one respect I can indeed perceive the accidental operation of the crusades, not so much in producing a benefit, as in removing an evil. The larger portion of the inhabitants of Europe was chained to the soil, without freedom, or property, or knowledge; and the two orders of ecclesiastics and nobles, whose numbers were comparatively small, alone deserved the name of citizens and men. This oppressive system was supported by the arts of the clergy and the swords of the barons. The authority of the priests operated in the darker ages as a salutary antidote: they prevented the total extinction of letters, mitigated the fierceness of the times, sheltered the poor and defenceless, and preserved or revived the peace and order of civil society. But the independence, rapine, and discord of the feudal lords were unmixed with any semblance of good; and every hope of industry and improvement was crushed by the iron weight of the martial aristocracy. Among the causes that <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>43<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> undermined the Gothic edifice, a conspicuous place must be allowed to the crusades. The estates of the barons were dissipated, and their race was often extinguished, in these costly and perilous expeditions. Their poverty extorted from their pride those charters of freedom which unlocked the fetters of the slave, secured the farm of the peasant and the shop of the artificer, and gradually restored a substance and a soul to the most numerous and useful part of the community. The conflagration which destroyed the tall and barren trees of the forest gave air and scope to the vegetation of the smaller and nutritive plants of the soil.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_283">I. Before the introduction of trade, which scatters riches, and of knowledge, which dispels prejudice, the prerogative of birth is most strongly felt and most humbly acknowledged. In every age the laws and manners of the Germans have discriminated the ranks of society: the dukes and counts, who shared the empire of Charlemagne, converted their office to an inheritance; and to his children each feudal lord bequeathed his honour and his sword. The proudest families are content to lose, in the darkness of the middle ages, the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>44<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> tree of their pedigree, which, however deep and lofty, must ultimately rise from a plebeian root; and their historians must descend ten centuries below the Christian era, before they can ascertain any lineal succession by the evidence of surnames, of arms, and of authentic records. With the first rays of light<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_092" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_092_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">91</a> we discern the nobility and opulence of Atho, a French knight: his nobility, in the rank and title of a nameless father; his opulence, in the foundation of the castle of Courtenay, in the district of Gatinois, about fifty-six miles to the south of Paris. From the reign of Robert, the son of Hugh Capet, the barons of Courtenay are conspicuous among the immediate vassals of the crown; and Joscelin, the grandson of Atho and a noble dame, is enrolled among the heroes of the first crusade. A domestic alliance (their mothers were sisters) attached him to the standard of Baldwin of Bruges, the second count of Edessa: a princely fief, which he was worthy to receive, and able to maintain, announces the number of his martial followers; and, after the departure of his cousin, Joscelin himself was invested with the county of Edessa on both sides of the Euphrates. By economy in peace his territories were replenished with Latin and Syrian subjects: his magazines with corn, wine, and oil; his castles with gold and silver, with arms and horses. In a holy warfare of thirty years he was alternately a conqueror and a captive; but he died like a soldier, in an horse-litter at the head of his troops; and his last glance beheld the flight of the Turkish invaders who had presumed on his age and infirmities. His son and successor, of the same name, was less deficient in valour than in vigilance; but he sometimes forgot that dominion is acquired and maintained by the same arts. He challenged the hostility of the Turks, without securing the friendship of the prince of Antioch; and, amidst the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>45<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> peaceful luxury of Turbessel, in Syria,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_093" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_093_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">92</a> Joscelin neglected the defence of the Christian frontier beyond the Euphrates. In his absence, Zenghi, the first of the Atabeks, besieged and stormed his capital, Edessa, which was feebly defended by a timorous and disloyal crowd of Orientals; the Franks were oppressed in a bold attempt for its recovery, and Courtenay ended his days in the prison of Aleppo. He still left a fair and ample patrimony. But the victorious Turks oppressed on all sides the weakness of a widow and orphan; and, for the equivalent of an annual pension, they resigned to the Greek emperor the charge of defending, and the shame of losing, the last relics of the Latin conquest. The countess-dowager of Edessa retired to Jerusalem with her two children: the daughter, Agnes, became the wife and mother of a king; the son, Joscelin the Third, accepted the office of seneschal, the first of the kingdom, and held his new estates in Palestine by the service of fifty knights. His name appears with honour in all the transactions of peace and war; but he finally vanishes in the fall of Jerusalem; and the name of Courtenay, in this branch of Edessa, was lost by the marriage of his two daughters with a French and a German baron.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_094" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_094_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">93</a></p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_284">II. While Joscelin reigned beyond the Euphrates, his elder brother, Milo, the son of Joscelin, the son of Atho, continued, near the Seine, to possess the castle of their fathers, which was at length inherited by Rainaud, or Reginald, the youngest of his three sons. Examples of genius or virtue must be rare in the annals of the oldest families; and, in a remote age, their pride will embrace a deed of rapine and <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>46<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> violence; such, however, as could not be perpetrated without some superiority of courage, or at least of power. A descendant of Reginald of Courtenay may blush for the public robber who stripped and imprisoned several merchants, after they had satisfied the king=E2=80=99s duties at Sens and Orleans. He will glory in the offence, since the bold offender could not be compelled to obedience and restitution, till the regent and the count of Champagne prepared to march against him at the head of an army.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_095" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_095_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">94</a> Reginald bestowed his estates on his eldest daughter, and his daughter on the seventh son of King Louis the Fat; and their marriage was crowned with a numerous offspring. We might expect that a private should have merged in a royal name; and that the descendants of Peter of France and Elizabeth of Courtenay would have enjoyed the title and honours of princes of the blood. But this legitimate claim was long neglected and finally denied; and the causes of their disgrace will represent the story of this second branch. 1. Of all the families now extant, the most ancient, doubtless, and the most illustrious is the house of France, which has occupied the same throne above eight hundred years, and descends, in a clear and lineal series of males, from the middle of the ninth century.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_096" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_096_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">95</a> In the age of the crusades it was already revered both in the East and West. <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>47<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> But from Hugh Capet to the marriage of Peter no more than five reigns or generations had elapsed; and so precarious was their title that the eldest sons, as a necessary precaution, were previously crowned during the lifetime of their fathers. The peers of France have long maintained their precedency before the younger branches of the royal line; nor had the princes of the blood, in the twelfth century, acquired that hereditary lustre which is now diffused over the most remote candidates for the succession. 2. The barons of Courtenay must have stood high in their own estimation, and in that of the world, since they could impose on the son of a king the obligation of adopting for himself and all his descendants the name and arms of their daughter and his wife. In the marriage of an heiress with her inferior or her equal, such exchange was often required and allowed; but, as they continued to diverge from the regal stem, the sons of Louis the Fat were insensibly confounded with their maternal ancestors; and the new Courtenays might deserve to forfeit the honours of their birth, which a motive of interest had tempted them to renounce. 3. The shame was far more permanent than the reward, and a momentary blaze was followed by a long darkness. The eldest son of these nuptials, Peter of Courtenay, had married, as I have already mentioned, the sister of the counts of Flanders, the two first emperors of Constantinople; he rashly accepted the invitation of the barons of Romania; his two sons, Robert and Baldwin, successively held and lost the remains of the Latin empire in the East, and the granddaughter of Baldwin the Second again mingled her blood with the blood of France and of Valois. To support the expenses of a troubled and transitory reign, their patrimonial estates were mortgaged or sold; and the last emperors of Constantinople depended on the annual charity of Rome and Naples.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_285">While the elder brothers dissipated their wealth in romantic <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>48<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> adventures, and the castle of Courtenay was profaned by a plebeian owner, the younger branches of that adopted name were propagated and multiplied. But their splendour was clouded by poverty and time: after the decease of Robert, great butler of France, they descended from princes to barons; the next generations were confounded with the simple gentry; the descendants of Hugh Capet could no longer be visible in the rural lords of Tanlay and of Champignelles. The more adventurous embraced, without dishonour, the profession of a soldier; the least active and opulent might sink, like their cousins of the branch of Dreux, into the condition of peasants. Their royal descent, in a dark period of four hundred years, became each day more obsolete and ambiguous; and their pedigree, instead of being enrolled in the annals of the kingdom, must be painfully searched by the minute diligence of heralds and genealogists. It was not till the end of the sixteenth century, on the accession of a family almost as remote as their own, that the princely spirit of the Courtenays again revived; and the question of the nobility provoked them to assert the royalty of their blood. They appealed to the justice and compassion of Henry the Fourth; obtained a favourable opinion from twenty lawyers of Italy and Germany, and modestly compared themselves to the descendants of King David, whose prerogatives were not impaired by the lapse of ages, or the trade of a carpenter.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_097" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_097_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">96</a> But every ear was deaf, and every circumstance was adverse, to their lawful claims.

It is certain, at least, that Henry the Second distinguished in his camps and councils <i>a</i> Reginald, of the name, arms, and, as it may be fairly presumed, of the genuine race of the Courtenays of France. The right of wardship enabled a feudal lord to reward his vassal with the marriage and estate of a noble heiress; and Reginald of Courtenay acquired a fair establishment in Devonshire, where his posterity has been seated above six hundred years.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_104" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_104_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">103</a> From a Norman baron, Baldwin de Brioniis, who had been invested by the Conqueror, Hawise, the wife of Reginald, derived the honour of Okehampton, which was held by the service of ninety-three knights; and a female might claim the manly offices of hereditary viscount or sheriff, and of captain of the royal castle of Exeter.

They were ranked among the chief of the barons of the realm; nor was it till after a strenuous dispute that they yielded to the fief of Arundel the first place in the parliament of England; their alliances were contracted with the noblest families, the Veres, Despensers, St. Johns, Talbots, Bohuns, and even the Plantagenets themselves; and in a contest with John of Lancaster, a Courtenay, bishop of London, and afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, might be accused of profane confidence in the strength and number of his kindred. In peace, the earls of Devon resided in their numerous castles and manors of the west; their ample revenue was appropriated to devotion and hospitality; and the epitaph of Edward, surnamed, from his misfortunes, the <i>blind</i>, from his virtues, the <i>good</i>, earl, inculcates with much ingenuity a moral sentence, which may, however, be abused by thoughtless generosity. After a grateful commemoration of the fifty-five years of union and happiness, which he enjoyed with Mabel his wife, the good earl thus speaks from the tomb: =E2=80=94</p>

The sums which they paid for livery and seisin attest the greatness of their possessions; and several estates have remained in their family since the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. In war, the Courtenays of England fulfilled the duties, and deserved the honours, of chivalry. They were often entrusted to levy and command the militia of Devonshire and Cornwall; they often attended their supreme lord to the borders of Scotland; and in foreign <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>52<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> service, for a stipulated price, they sometimes maintained fourscore men at arms and as many archers. By sea and land they fought under the standard of the Edwards and Henries; their names are conspicuous in battles, in tournaments, and in the original list of the order of the Garter; three brothers shared the Spanish victory of the Black Prince; and in the lapse of six generations the English Courtenays had learned to despise the nation and country from which they derived their origin. In the quarrel of the two Roses, the earls of Devon adhered to the house of Lancaster, and three brothers successively died either in the field or on the scaffold. Their honours and estates were restored by Henry the Seventh; a daughter of Edward the Fourth was not disgraced by the nuptials of a Courtenay; their son, who was created marquis of Exeter, enjoyed the favour of his cousin, Henry the Eighth; and in the camp of Cloth of Gold he broke a lance against the French monarch. But the favour of Henry was the prelude of disgrace; his disgrace was the signal of death; and of the victims of the jealous tyrant, the marquis of Exeter is one of the most noble and guiltless. His son Edward lived a prisoner in the Tower, and died an exile at Padua; and the secret love of Queen Mary, whom he slighted, perhaps for the princess Elizabeth, has shed a romantic colour on the story of this beautiful youth. The relics of his patrimony were conveyed into strange families by the marriages of his four aunts; and his personal honours, as if they had been legally extinct, were revived by the patents of succeeding princes. But there still survived a lineal descendant of Hugh, the first earl of Devon, a younger branch of the Courtenays, who have been seated at Powderham Castle above four hundred years, from the reign of Edward the Third to the present hour. Their estates have been increased by the grant and improvement of lands in Ireland, and they have been recently restored to the honours of the peerage. Yet the Courtenays still retain the plaintive motto, which asserts the innocence, and deplores the fall, of <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>53<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> their ancient house.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_107" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_107_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">106</a> While they sigh for past greatness, they are doubtless sensible of present blessings; in the long series of the Courtenay annals, the most splendid era is likewise the most unfortunate; nor can an opulent peer of Britain be inclined to envy the emperors of Constantinople, who wandered over Europe to solicit alms for the support of their dignity and the defence of their capital.</p>

In his first efforts the fugitive Lascaris commanded only three cities and two thousand soldiers; his reign was the season of generous and active despair; in every military operation he staked his life and crown; and his enemies, of the Hellespont and the M=C3=A6ander, were surprised by his celerity and subdued by his boldness. A victorious reign of eighteen years expanded the principality of Nice to the magnitude of an empire. The throne of his successor and son-in-law, Vataces, was founded on a more solid basis, a larger scope, and more plentiful resources; and it was the temper as well as the interest of Vataces to calculate the risk, to expect the moment, and to ensure the success of his ambitious designs. In the decline of the Latins I have briefly exposed the progress of the Greeks: the prudent and gradual advances of a conqueror, who, in a reign of thirty-three years, rescued the provinces from national and foreign usurpers, till he pressed on all sides the Imperial city, a leafless and sapless trunk, which must fall at the first stroke of the axe. But his interior and peaceful administration is still more deserving of notice and praise.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_110" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_110_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> The calamities of the times had wasted the numbers and the substance of the Greeks; the motives and the means of agriculture were extirpated; and the most fertile lands were left without cultivation or inhabitants. A portion of this vacant property was occupied and improved by the command, and for the benefit, of the emperor; a powerful hand and a vigilant eye supplied and surpassed, by a skilful management, the minute diligence of a private farmer; the royal domain became the garden and granary of Asia; and without impoverishing the people the sovereign acquired a fund of innocent and productive wealth.

The produce of his domain was applied to the maintenance of his palace and hospitals, the calls of dignity and benevolence; the lesson was still more useful than the revenue; the plough was restored to its ancient security and honour; and the nobles were taught to seek a sure and independent revenue from their estates, instead of adorning their splendid beggary by the oppression of the people, or (what is almost the same) by the favours of the court. The superfluous stock of corn and cattle was eagerly purchased by the Turks, with whom Vataces preserved a strict and sincere alliance; but he discouraged the importation of foreign manufactures, the costly silks of the East and the curious labours of the Italian looms. =E2=80=9CThe demands of nature and necessity,=E2=80=9D was he accustomed to say, =E2=80=9Care indispensable; but the influence of passion may rise and sink at the breath of a monarch=E2=80=9D; and both his precept and example recommended simplicity of manners and the use of domestic industry.

On a march in Bulgaria he consulted on a question of policy his principal ministers; and the Greek logothete, George Acropolita, presumed to offend him by the declaration of a free and honest opinion. The emperor half unsheathed his scymetar; but his more deliberate rage reserved Acropolita for a baser punishment. One of the first officers of the empire was ordered to dismount, stripped of his robes, and extended on the ground in the presence of the prince and army. In this posture he was chastised with so many and such heavy blows from the clubs of two guards or executioners that, when Theodore commanded them to cease, the great logothete was scarcely able to rise and crawl away to his tent. After a seclusion of some days, he was recalled by a peremptory mandate to his seat in council; and so dead were the Greeks to the sense of honour and shame that it is from the narrative of the sufferer himself that we acquire the knowledge of his disgrace.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_117" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_117_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">10</a> The cruelty <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>59<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> of the emperor was exasperated by the pangs of sickness, the approach of a premature end, and the suspicion of poison and magic.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_118" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_118_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">11</a> The lives and fortunes, the eyes and limbs, of his kinsmen and nobles were sacrificed to each sally of passion; and, before he died, the son of Vataces might deserve from the people, or at least from the Court, the appellation of tyrant.

In his last hours the emperor testified a wish to forgive and be forgiven, a just anxiety for the fate of John, his son and successor, who, at the age of eight years, was condemned to the dangers of a long minority. His last choice entrusted the office of guardian to the sanctity of the patriarch Arsenius, and to the courage of George Muzalon, the great domestic, who was equally distinguished by the royal favour and the public hatred.

In the first council after the emperor=E2=80=99s death, Muzalon, from a lofty throne, pronounced a laboured apology of his conduct and intentions: his modesty was subdued by an unanimous assurance of esteem and fidelity; and his most inveterate enemies were the loudest to salute him as the guardian and saviour of the Romans.

The purple was not dishonoured by their alliance; and, had the law of succession, and female succession, been strictly observed, the wife of Theodore Lascaris must have yielded to her elder sister, the mother of Michael Pal=C3=A6ologus, who afterwards raised his family to the throne. In his person, the splendour of birth was dignified by the merit of the soldier and statesman: in his early youth he was promoted to the office of <i>Constable</i> or commander of the French mercenaries; the private expense of a day never exceeded three pieces of gold; but his ambition was rapacious and profuse; and his gifts were doubled by the graces of his conversation and manners. The love of the soldiers and people excited the jealousy of the court; and Michael thrice escaped from the dangers in which he was involved by his own imprudence or that of his friends. I. Under the reign of Justice and Vataces, a dispute arose<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_125" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_125_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">18</a> between two officers, one of whom accused the other of maintaining the hereditary right of the Pal=C3=A6ologi. The cause was decided, according to the new jurisprudence of the Latins, by single combat: the defendant was overthrown; but he persisted in declaring that himself alone was guilty; and that he had uttered these rash or treasonable speeches without the approbation or knowledge of his patron. Yet a cloud of suspicion hung over the innocence of the constable; he was still pursued by the whispers of malevolence; and a subtile courtier, the archbishop of Philadelphia, urged him to accept the judgment of God in the fiery proof of the ordeal.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_126" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_126_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">19</a> Three days before the trial, the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>62<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> patient=E2=80=99s arm was enclosed in a bag and secured by the royal signet; and it was incumbent on him to bear a red-hot ball of iron three times from the altar to the rails of the sanctuary, without artifice and without injury. Pal=C3=A6ologus eluded the dangerous experiment with sense and pleasantry. =E2=80=9CI am a soldier,=E2=80=9D said he, =E2=80=9Cand will boldly enter the lists with my accusers; but a layman, a sinner like myself, is not endowed with the gift of miracles. <i>Your</i> piety, most holy prelate, may deserve the interposition of Heaven, and from your hands I will receive the fiery globe, the pledge of my innocence.=E2=80=9D The archbishop started; the emperor smiled; and the absolution or pardon of Michael was approved by new rewards and new services. II. In the succeeding reign, as he held the government of Nice, he was secretly informed that the mind of the absent prince was poisoned with jealousy; and that death or blindness would be his final reward. Instead of awaiting the return and sentence of Theodore, the constable, with some followers, escaped from the city and the empire; and, though he was plundered by the Turkmans of the desert, he found an hospitable refuge in the court of the sultan. In the ambiguous state of an exile, Michael reconciled the duties of gratitude and loyalty; drawing his sword against the Tartars; admonishing the garrisons of the Roman limit; and promoting, by his influence, the restoration of peace, in which his pardon and recall were honourably included. III. While he guarded the West against the despot of Epirus, Michael was again suspected and condemned in the palace; and such was his loyalty or weakness that he submitted to be led in chains above six hundred miles from Durazzo to Nice. The civility of the messenger alleviated his disgrace; the emperor=E2=80=99s sickness dispelled his danger; and the last breath of Theodore, which recommended his infant son, <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>63<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> at once acknowledged the innocence and the power of Pal=C3=A6ologus.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_295">But his innocence had been too unworthily treated, and his power was too strongly felt, to curb an aspiring subject in the fair field that was offered to his ambition.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_127" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_127_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">20</a> In the council after the death of Theodore, he was the first to pronounce, and the first to violate, the oath of allegiance to Muzalon; and so dexterous was his conduct that he reaped the benefit, without incurring the guilt, or at least the reproach, of the subsequent massacre. In the choice of a regent, he balanced the interests and passions of the candidates; turned their envy and hatred from himself against each other, and forced every competitor to own that, after his own claims, those of Pal=C3=A6ologus were best entitled to the preference. Under the title of Great Duke, he accepted or assumed, during a long minority, the active powers of government; the patriarch was a venerable name; and the factious nobles were seduced, or oppressed, by the ascendant of his genius. The fruits of the economy of Vataces were deposited in a strong castle on the banks of the Hermus,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_128" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_128_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">21</a> in the custody of the faithful Varangians; the constable retained his command or influence over the foreign troops; he employed the guards to possess the treasure, and the treasure to corrupt the guards; and, whatsoever might be the abuse of the public money, his character was above the suspicion of private avarice. By himself, or by his emissaries, he strove to persuade every rank of subjects that their own prosperity would rise in just proportion to the establishment of his authority. The weight of taxes was suspended, the perpetual theme of popular complaint; and he prohibited the trials by the ordeal and judicial combat.

For the future maintenance of their wives and children the veterans were grateful; the priest and the philosopher applauded his ardent zeal for the advancement of religion and learning; and his vague promise of rewarding merit was applied by every candidate to his own hopes. Conscious of the influence of the clergy, Michael successfully laboured to secure the suffrage of that powerful order. Their expensive journey from Nice to Magnesia afforded a decent and ample pretence; the leading prelates were tempted by the liberality of his nocturnal visits; and the incorruptible patriarch was flattered by the homage of his new colleague, who led his mule by the bridle into the town, and removed to a respectful distance the importunity of the crowd. Without renouncing his title by royal descent, Pal=C3=A6ologus encouraged a free discussion into the advantages of elective monarchy; and his adherents asked, with the insolence of triumph, What patient would trust his health, or what merchant would abandon his vessel, to the <i>hereditary</i> skill of a physician or a <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>65<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> pilot? The youth of the emperor and the impending dangers of a minority required the support of a mature and experienced guardian; of an associate raised above the envy of his equals, and invested with the name and prerogatives of royalty. For the interest of the prince and people, without any views for himself or his family, the Great Duke consented to guard and instruct the son of Theodore; but he sighed for the happy moment when he might restore to his firmer hands the administration of his patrimony, and enjoy the blessings of a private station. He was first invested with the title and prerogatives of <i>despot</i>, which bestowed the purple ornaments, and the second place in the Roman monarchy. It was afterwards agreed that John and Michael should be proclaimed as joint emperors, and raised on the buckler, but that the pre-eminence should be reserved for the birth-right of the former. A mutual league of amity was pledged between the royal partners; and, in case of a rupture, the subjects were bound, by their oath of allegiance, to declare themselves against the aggressor: an ambiguous name, the seed of discord and civil war. Pal=C3=A6ologus was content; but on the day of his coronation, and in the cathedral of Nice, his zealous adherents most vehemently urged the just priority of his age and merit. The unseasonable dispute was eluded by postponing to a more convenient opportunity the coronation of John Lascaris; and he walked with a slight diadem in the train of his guardian, who alone received the Imperial crown from the hands of the patriarch. It was not without extreme reluctance that Arsenius abandoned the cause of his pupil; but the Varangians brandished their battle-axes; a sign of assent was extorted from the trembling youth; and some voices were heard, that the life of a child should no longer impede the settlement of the nation. A full harvest of honours and employments was distributed among his friends by the grateful Pal=C3=A6ologus. In his own family he created a despot and two sebastocrators; Alexius Strategopulus <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>66<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> was decorated with the title of C=C3=A6sar; and that veteran commander soon repaid the obligation, by restoring Constantinople to the Greek emperor.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_296">It was in the second year of his reign, while he resided in the palace and gardens of Nymph=C3=A6um,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_132" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_132_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">25</a> near Smyrna, that the first messenger arrived at the dead of night; and the stupendous intelligence was imparted to Michael, after he had been gently waked by the tender precaution of his sister Eulogia.

As an hostage, the doubtful author was confined, with the assurance of death or an ample recompense; and the court was left some hours in the anxiety of hope and fear, till the messengers of Alexius arrived with the authentic intelligence, and displayed the trophies of the conquest, the sword and sceptre,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_133" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_133_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">26</a> the buskins and bonnet,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_134" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_134_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">27</a> of the usurper Baldwin, which he had dropt in <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>67<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> his precipitate flight. A general assembly of the bishops, senators, and nobles was immediately convened, and never perhaps was an event received with more heartfelt and universal joy. In a studied oration, the new sovereign of Constantinople congratulated his own and the public fortune. =E2=80=9CThere was a time,=E2=80=9D said he, =E2=80=9Ca far-distant time, when the Roman empire extended to the Adriatic, the Tigris, and the confines of Ethiopia. After the loss of the provinces, our capital itself, in these last and calamitous days, has been wrested from our hands by the Barbarians of the West. From the lowest ebb, the tide of prosperity has again returned in our favour; but our prosperity was that of fugitives and exiles; and, when we were asked, Which was the country of the Romans? we indicated with a blush the climate of the globe and the quarter of the heavens. The Divine Providence has now restored to our arms the city of Constantine, the sacred seat of religion and empire; and it will depend on our valour and conduct to render this important acquisition the pledge and omen of future victories.=E2=80=9D So eager was the impatience of the prince and people that Michael made his triumphal entry into Constantinople only twenty days after the expulsion of the Latins. The golden gate was thrown open at his approach; the devout conqueror dismounted from his horse; and a miraculous image of Mary, the Conductress, was borne before him, that the divine Virgin in person might appear to conduct him to the temple of her Son, the cathedral of St. Sophia. But, after the first transport of devotion and pride, he sighed at the dreary prospect of solitude and ruin. The palace was defiled with smoke and dirt, and the gross intemperance of the Franks; whole streets had been consumed by fire, or were decayed by the injuries of time; the sacred and profane edifices were stripped of their ornaments; and, as if they were conscious of their approaching exile, the industry of the Latins had been confined to the work of pillage and destruction. Trade had expired under the pressure of anarchy and distress; and the number of <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>68<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> inhabitants had decreased with the opulence of the city. It was the first care of the Greek monarch to reinstate the nobles in the palaces of their fathers; and the houses or the ground which they occupied were restored to the families that could exhibit a legal right of inheritance. But the far greater part was extinct or lost; the vacant property had devolved to the lord; he repeopled Constantinople by a liberal invitation to the provinces; and the brave <i>volunteers</i> were seated in the capital which had been recovered by their arms. The French barons and the principal families had retired with their emperor; but the patient and humble crowd of Latins was attached to the country, and indifferent to the change of masters. Instead of banishing the factories of the Pisans, Venetians, and Genoese, the prudent conqueror accepted their oaths of allegiance, encouraged their industry, confirmed their privileges, and allowed them to live under the jurisdiction of their proper magistrates. Of these nations, the Pisans and Venetians preserved their respective quarters in the city; but the services and powers of the Genoese deserved at the same time the gratitude<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_135" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_135_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">28</a> and the jealousy of the Greeks. Their independent colony was first planted at the sea-port town of Heraclea in Thrace. They were speedily recalled, and settled in the exclusive possession of the suburb of Galata, an advantageous post, in which they revived the commerce, and insulted the majesty, of the Byzantine empire.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_136" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_136_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">29</a></p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_297">The recovery of Constantinople was celebrated as the era of a new empire: the conqueror, alone, and by the right of the sword, renewed his coronation in the church of St. Sophia; and the name and honours of John Lascaris, his pupil and lawful sovereign, were insensibly abolished. But his claims still lived in the minds of the people; and the royal youth must speedily attain the years of manhood and ambition. <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>69<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> By fear or conscience, Pal=C3=A6ologus was restrained from dipping his hands in innocent and royal blood; but the anxiety of an usurper and a parent urged him to secure his throne by one of those imperfect crimes so familiar to the modern Greeks. The loss of sight incapacitated the young prince for the active business of the world: instead of the brutal violence of tearing out his eyes, the visual nerve was destroyed by the intense glare of a red-hot bason,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_137" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_137_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">30</a> and John Lascaris was removed to a distant castle, where he spent many years in privacy and oblivion. Such cool and deliberate guilt may seem incompatible with remorse; but, if Michael could trust the mercy of Heaven, he was not inaccessible to the reproaches and vengeance of mankind, which he had provoked by cruelty and treason. His cruelty imposed on a servile court the duties of applause or silence; but the clergy had a right to speak in the name of their invisible master; and their holy legions were led by a prelate, whose character was above the temptations of hope or fear. After a short abdication of his dignity, Arsenius<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_138" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_138_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">31</a> had consented to ascend the ecclesiastical throne of Constantinople, and to preside in the restoration of the church. His pious simplicity was long deceived by the arts of Pal=C3=A6ologus; and his patience and submission might soothe the usurper, and protect the safety of the young prince. On the news of his inhuman treatment, the patriarch unsheathed the spiritual sword; and superstition, on this occasion, was enlisted in the cause of humanity and justice. <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>70<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> In a synod of bishops, who were stimulated by the example of his zeal, the patriarch pronounced a sentence of excommunication; though his prudence still repeated the name of Michael in the public prayers. The Eastern prelates had not adopted the dangerous maxims of ancient Rome; nor did they presume to enforce their censures, by deposing princes, or absolving nations from their oaths of allegiance. But the Christian who had been separated from God and the church became an object of horror; and, in a turbulent and fanatic capital that horror might arm the hand of an assassin or inflame a sedition of the people. Pal=C3=A6ologus felt his danger, confessed his guilt, and deprecated his judge: the act was irretrievable; the prize was obtained; and the most rigorous penance, which he solicited, would have raised the sinner to the reputation of a saint. The unrelenting patriarch refused to announce any means of atonement or any hopes of mercy; and condescended only to pronounce that, for so great a crime, great indeed must be the satisfaction. =E2=80=9CDo you require,=E2=80=9D said Michael, =E2=80=9Cthat I should abdicate the empire?=E2=80=9D And at these words he offered, or seemed to offer, the sword of state. Arsenius eagerly grasped this pledge of sovereignty; but, when he perceived that the emperor was unwilling to purchase absolution at so dear a rate, he indignantly escaped to his cell, and left the royal sinner kneeling and weeping before the door.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_139" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_139_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">32</a></p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_298">The danger and scandal of this excommunication subsisted above three years, till the popular clamour was assuaged by time and repentance; till the brethren of Arsenius condemned his inflexible spirit, so repugnant to the unbounded forgiveness of the gospel. The emperor had artfully insinuated that, if he were still rejected at home, he might seek, in the Roman pontiff, a more indulgent judge; but it was far more easy and <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>71<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> effectual to find or to place that judge at the head of the Byzantine church. Arsenius was involved in a vague rumour of conspiracy and disaffection; some irregular steps in his ordination and government were liable to censure; a synod deposed him from the episcopal office; and he was transported under a guard of soldiers to a small island of the Propontis. Before his exile, he sullenly requested that a strict account might be taken of the treasures of the church; boasted that his whole riches, three pieces of gold, had been earned by transcribing the Psalms; continued to assert the freedom of his mind; and denied, with his last breath, the pardon which was implored by the royal sinner.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_140" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_140_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">33</a> After some delay, Gregory, bishop of Hadrianople, was translated to the Byzantine throne; but his authority was found insufficient to support the absolution of the emperor; and Joseph, a reverend monk, was substituted to that important function. This edifying scene was represented in the presence of the senate and people; at the end of six years, the humble penitent was restored to the communion of the faithful; and humanity will rejoice that a milder treatment of the captive Lascaris was stipulated as a proof of his remorse. But the spirit of Arsenius still survived in a powerful faction of the monks and clergy, who preserved above forty-eight years in an obstinate schism. Their scruples were treated with tenderness and respect by Michael and his son; and the reconciliation of the Arsenites was the serious labour of the church and state. In the confidence of fanaticism, they had proposed to try their cause by a miracle; and, when the two papers that contained their own and the adverse cause were cast into a fiery brazier, they expected that the Catholic verity would be respected by the flames. Alas! the two papers were indiscriminately consumed, and this unforeseen accident <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>72<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> produced the union of a day, and renewed the quarrel of an age.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_141" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_141_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">34</a> The final treaty displayed the victory of the Arsenites; the clergy abstained during forty days from all ecclesiastical functions; a slight penance was imposed on the laity; the body of Arsenius was deposited in the sanctuary; and in the name of the departed saint the prince and people were released from the sins of their fathers.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_142" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_142_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">35</a></p>

Michael himself, had he died in a private station, would have been thought more worthy of the empire; and the assaults of his temporal and spiritual enemies left him few moments to labour for his own fame or the happiness of his subjects.

But, in the prosecution of these Western conquests, the countries beyond the Hellespont were left naked to the Turks; and their depredations verified the prophecy of a dying senator, that the recovery of Constantinople would be the ruin of Asia. The victories of Michael were achieved by his lieutenants; his sword rusted in the palace; and, in the transactions of the emperor with the popes and the king of Naples, his political arts were stained with cruelty and fraud.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_145" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_145_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">38</a></p>

The Vatican was the most natural refuge of a Latin emperor, who had been driven from his throne; and Pope Urban the Fourth appeared to pity the misfortunes, and vindicate the cause, of the fugitive Baldwin. A crusade, with plenary indulgence, was preached by his command against the schismatic Greeks; he excommunicated their allies and adherents; solicited Louis the Ninth in favour of his kinsman; and demanded a tenth of the ecclesiastic revenues of France and England for the service of the holy war.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_146" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_146_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">39</a> The subtile Greek, who watched the rising tempest of the West, attempted to suspend or soothe the hostility of the pope, by suppliant embassies and respectful letters; but he insinuated that the establishment of peace must prepare the reconciliation and obedience of the Eastern church.

After a long and affected delay, the approach of danger and the importunity of Gregory the Tenth compelled him to enter on a more serious negotiation; he alleged the example of the great Vataces; and the Greek clergy, who understood the intentions of their prince, were not alarmed by the first steps of reconciliation and respect. But, when he pressed the conclusion of the treaty, they strenuously declared that the Latins, though not in name, were heretics in fact, and that they despised those strangers as the vilest and most despicable portion of the human race.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_147" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_147_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">40</a> It was the task of the emperor to persuade, to corrupt, to intimidate, the most popular ecclesiastics, to gain the vote of each individual, and alternately to urge the arguments of Christian charity and the public welfare. The texts of the fathers and the arms of the Franks were balanced in the theological and political scale; and, without approving the addition to the Nicene creed, the most moderate were taught to confess that the two hostile propositions of proceeding from the Father <span class=3D"sc">by</span> the Son, and of proceeding from the Father <span class=3D"sc">and</span> the Son, might be reduced to a safe and catholic sense.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_148" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_148_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">41</a> The supremacy of the pope was a doctrine more easy to conceive, but more painful to acknowledge; yet Michael represented to his monks and prelates that they might submit to name the Roman bishop as the first of the patriarchs, and that their distance and discretion would guard the liberties of the Eastern church from the mischievous consequences of the right of appeal. He protested that he would sacrifice his <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>75<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> life and empire rather than yield the smallest point of orthodox faith or national independence; and this declaration was sealed and ratified by a golden bull. The patriarch Joseph withdrew to a monastery, to resign or resume his throne, according to the event of the treaty; the letters of union and obedience were subscribed by the emperor, his son Andronicus, and thirty-five archbishops and metropolitans, with their respective synods; and the episcopal list was multiplied by many dioceses which were annihilated under the yoke of the infidels. An embassy was composed of some trusty ministers and prelates; they embarked for Italy, with rich ornaments and rare perfumes for the altar of St. Peter; and their secret orders authorised and recommended a boundless compliance. They were received in the general council of Lyons, by Pope Gregory the Tenth, at the head of five hundred bishops.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_149" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_149_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">42</a> He embraced with tears his longlost and repentant children; accepted the oath of the ambassadors, who abjured the schism in the name of the two emperors; adorned the prelates with the ring and mitre; chaunted in Greek and Latin the Nicene creed, with the addition of <i>filioque;</i> and rejoiced in the union of the East and West, which had been reserved for his reign. To consummate this pious work, the Byzantine deputies were speedily followed by the pope=E2=80=99s nuncios; and their instruction discloses the policy of the Vatican, which could not be satisfied with the vain title of supremacy. After viewing the temper of the prince and people, they were enjoined to absolve the schismatic clergy who should subscribe and swear their abjuration and obedience; to establish in all the churches the use of the perfect creed; to prepare the entrance of a cardinal legate, with the full powers and dignity of his office; and to instruct the emperor in the advantages which he <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>76<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> might derive from the temporal protection of the Roman pontiff.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_150" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_150_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">43</a></p>

But, in his private language, Pal=C3=A6ologus affected to deplore the pride, and to blame the innovations, of the Latins; and, while he debased his character by this double hypocrisy, he justified and punished the opposition of his subjects. By the joint suffrage of the new and the ancient Rome, a sentence of excommunication was pronounced against the obstinate schismatics; the censures of the church were executed by the sword of Michael; on the failure of persuasion, he tried the arguments of prison and exile, of whipping and mutilation: those touchstones, says an historian, of cowards and the brave. Two Greeks still reigned in =C3=86tolia, Epirus, and Thessaly, with the appellation of despots; they had yielded to the sovereign of Constantinople; but they rejected the chains of the Roman pontiff, and supported their refusal by successful arms. Under their protection, the fugitive monks and bishops assembled in hostile synods, and retorted the name of heretic with the galling addition of apostate; the prince of Trebizond was tempted to assume the forfeit title of emperor; and even the Latins of Negropont, Thebes, Athens, and the Morea forgot the merits of the convert, to join, with open or <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>77<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> clandestine aid, the enemies of Pal=C3=A6ologus. His favourite generals, of his own blood and family, successively deserted or betrayed the sacrilegious trust.

They were conducted to the prison, to behold four princes of the royal blood chained in the four corners, and shaking their fetters in an agony of grief and rage. Two of these captives were afterwards released, the one by submission, the other by death; but the obstinacy of their two companions was chastised by the loss of their eyes; and the Greeks, the least adverse to the union, deplore that cruel and inauspicious tragedy.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_153" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_153_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">46</a> Persecutors must expect the hatred of those whom they oppress; but they commonly find some consolation in the testimony of their conscience, the applause of their party, and, perhaps, the success of their undertaking.

In the distress of the Latins, the walls and towers of Constantinople had fallen to decay; they were restored and fortified by the policy of Michael who deposited a plenteous store of corn and salt provisions, to sustain the siege which he might hourly expect from the resentment of the Western powers. Of these, the sovereign of the Two Sicilies was the most formidable neighbour; but, as long as they were possessed by Mainfroy, the bastard of Frederic the Second, his monarchy was the bulwark rather than the annoyance of the Eastern empire. The usurper, though a brave and active prince, was sufficiently employed in the defence of his throne; his proscription by successive popes had separated Mainfroy from the common cause of the Latins; and the forces that might have besieged Constantinople were detained in a <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>79<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> crusade against the domestic enemy of Rome.

Naples and Sicily were immediately peopled with a warlike race of French nobles; and their aspiring leader embraced the future conquest of Africa, Greece, and Palestine. The most specious reasons might point his first arms against the Byzantine empire; and Pal=C3=A6ologus, diffident of his own strength, repeatedly appealed from the ambition of Charles to the humanity of St. Louis, who still preserved a just ascendant over the mind of his ferocious brother. For a while the attention of that brother was confined at home by the invasion of Conradin, the last heir of the Imperial house of Swabia; but the hapless boy sunk in the unequal conflict; and his execution on a public scaffold taught the rivals of Charles to tremble for their <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>80<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> heads as well as their dominions. A second respite was obtained by the last crusade of St. Louis to the African coast; and the double motive of interest and duty urged the king of Naples to assist, with his powers and his presence, the holy enterprise. The death of St. Louis released him from the importunity of a virtuous censor; the king of Tunis confessed himself the tributary and vassal of the crown of Sicily; and the boldest of the French knights were free to enlist under his banner against the Greek empire. A treaty and a marriage united his interest with the house of Courtenay; his daughter, Beatrice, was promised to Philip, son and heir of the emperor Baldwin; a pension of six hundred ounces of gold was allowed for his maintenance; and his generous father distributed among his allies the kingdoms and provinces of the East, reserving only Constantinople, and one day=E2=80=99s journey round the city, for the Imperial domain.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_157" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_157_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">50</a> In this perilous moment, Pal=C3=A6ologus was the most eager to subscribe the creed, and implore the protection, of the Roman pontiff, who assumed, with propriety and weight, the character of an angel of peace, the common father of the Christians.

He appears to have respected the disinterested mediation of Gregory the Tenth; but Charles was insensibly disgusted by the pride and partiality of Nicholas the Third; and his attachment to his kindred, the Ursini family, alienated the most strenuous champion from the service of the church. The hostile league against the Greeks, of Philip the Latin emperor, the king of the Two Sicilies, and the republic of Venice, was ripened into execution; <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>81<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> and the election of Martin the Fourth, a French pope, gave a sanction to the cause.

A distant day was appointed for assembling this mighty force in the harbour of Brindisi; and a previous attempt was risked with a detachment of three hundred knights, who invaded Albania and besieged the fortress of Belgrade.

Pal=C3=A6ologus was easily persuaded to divert his enemy from a foreign war by a rebellion at home; and a Greek subsidy of twenty-five thousand ounces of gold was most profitably applied to arm a Catalan fleet, which sailed under an holy banner to the specious attack of the Saracens of Africa. In the disguise of a monk or beggar, the indefatigable missionary of revolt flew from Constantinople to Rome, and from Sicily to Saragossa; the treaty was sealed with the signet of Pope Nicholas himself, the enemy of Charles; and his deed of gift transferred the fiefs of St. Peter from the house of Anjou to that of Arragon. So widely diffused and so freely circulated, the secret was preserved above two years with impenetrable discretion; and each of the conspirators imbibed the maxim of Peter, who declared that he would cut off his left hand, if it were conscious of the intentions of his right. The mine was prepared with deep and dangerous artifice; but it may be questioned whether the instant explosion of Palermo were the effect of accident or design.</p>

In modern times our debts and taxes are the secret poison, which still corrodes the bosom of peace; but in the weak and disorderly government of the middle ages it was agitated by the present evil of the disbanded armies. Too idle to work, too proud to beg, the mercenaries were accustomed to a life of rapine: they could rob with more dignity and effect under a banner and a chief; and the sovereign, to whom their service was useless and their presence importunate, endeavoured to discharge the torrent on some neighbouring countries.

In a warfare of twenty years, a ship, or a camp, was become their country; arms were their sole profession and property; valour was the only virtue which they knew; their women had imbibed the fearless temper of their lovers and husbands; it was reported that, with a stroke of their broad sword, the Catalans could cleave a horseman and an horse; and the report itself was a powerful weapon.

But, after a short season of prosperity, the cloud of slavery and ruin again burst on that unhappy province. The inhabitants escaped (says a Greek historian) from the smoke into the flames; and the hostility of the Turks was less pernicious than the friendship of the Catalans. The lives and fortunes which they had rescued, they considered as their own; the willing or reluctant maid was saved from the race of circumcision for the embraces of a Christian soldier; the exaction of fines and supplies was enforced by licentious rapine and arbitrary executions; and, on the resistance of Magnesia, the Great Duke besieged a city of the Roman empire.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_169" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_169_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">62</a> These disorders he excused by the wrongs and passions <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>87<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> of a victorious army; nor would his own authority or person have been safe, had he dared to punish his faithful followers, who were defrauded of the just and covenanted price of their services. The threats and complaints of Andronicus disclosed the nakedness of the empire. His golden bull had invited no more than five hundred horse and a thousand foot-soldiers; yet the crowd of volunteers, who migrated to the East, had been enlisted and fed by his spontaneous bounty. While his bravest allies were content with three byzants, or pieces of gold, for their monthly pay, an ounce or even two ounces of gold were assigned to the Catalans, whose annual pension would thus amount to near an hundred pounds sterling; one of their chiefs had modestly rated at three hundred thousand crowns the value of his <i>future</i> merits; and above a million had been issued from the treasury for the maintenance of these costly mercenaries. A cruel tax had been imposed on the corn of the husbandman: one third was retrenched from the salaries of the public officers; and the standard of the coin was so shamefully debased that of the four-and-twenty parts only five were of pure gold.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_170" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_170_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">63</a> At the summons of the emperor, Roger evacuated a province which no longer supplied the materials of rapine; but he refused to disperse his troops; and, while his style was respectful, his conduct was independent and hostile.

The loss of their leader intimidated the crowd of adventurers, who hoisted the sails of flight, and were soon scattered round the coasts of the Mediterranean. But a veteran band of fifteen hundred Catalans or French stood firm in the strong fortress of Gallipoli on the Hellespont, displayed the banners of Arragon, and offered to revenge and justify their chief by an equal combat of ten or an hundred warriors. Instead of accepting this bold defiance, the emperor Michael, the son and colleague of Andronicus, resolved to oppress them with the weight of multitudes: every nerve was strained to form an army of thirteen thousand horse and thirty thousand foot; and the Propontis was covered with the ships of the Greeks and Genoese. In two battles by sea and land, these mighty forces were encountered and overthrown by the despair and discipline of the Catalans; the young emperor fled to the palace; and an insufficient guard of light horse was left for the protection of the open country.

Four times the emperor Andronicus sued for peace, and four times he was inflexibly repulsed, till the want of provisions, and the discord of the chiefs, compelled the Catalans to evacuate the banks of the Hellespont and the neighbourhood of the capital.

He is celebrated as the most learned and virtuous prince of the age; but such virtue and such learning contributed neither to the perfection of the individual nor to the happiness of society. A slave of the most abject superstition, he was surrounded on all sides by visible and invisible enemies; nor were the flames of hell less dreadful to his fancy than those of a Catalan or Turkish war. Under the reign of the Pal=C3=A6ologi, the choice of the patriarch was the most important business of the state; the heads of the Greek church were ambitious and fanatic monks; and their vices or virtues, their learning or ignorance, were equally mischievous or contemptible. By his intemperate discipline, the patriarch Athanasius<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_190" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_190_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> excited the hatred <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>95<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> of the clergy and people: he was heard to declare that the sinner should swallow the last dregs of the cup of penance; and the foolish tale was propagated of his punishing a sacrilegious ass that had tasted the lettuce of a convent-garden. Driven from the throne by the universal clamour, Athanasius composed, before his retreat, two papers of a very opposite cast. His public testament was in the tone of charity and resignation; the private codicil breathed the direst anathemas against the authors of his disgrace, whom he excluded for ever from the communion of the Holy Trinity, the angels, and the saints. This last paper he enclosed in an earthen pot, which was placed, by his order, on the top of one of the pillars in the dome of St. Sophia, in the distant hope of discovery and revenge. At the end of four years, some youths, climbing by a ladder in search of pigeons=E2=80=99 nests, detected the fatal secret; and, as Andronicus felt himself touched and bound by the excommunication, he trembled on the brink of the abyss which had been so treacherously dug under his feet. A synod of bishops was instantly convened to debate this important question; the rashness of these clandestine anathemas was generally condemned; but, as the knot could be untied only by the same hand, as that hand was now deprived of the crosier, it appeared that this posthumous decree was irrevocable by any earthly power. Some faint testimonies of repentance and pardon were extorted from the author of the mischief; but the conscience of the emperor was still wounded, and he desired, with no less ardour than Athanasius himself, the restoration of a patriarch by whom alone he could be healed. At the dead of night a monk rudely knocked at the door of the royal bed-chamber, announcing a revelation of plague and famine, of inundations and earthquakes. Andronicus started from his bed, and spent the night in prayer, till he felt, or thought that he felt, a slight motion of the earth. The emperor, on foot, led the bishops and monks to the cell of Athanasius; and, after a proper resistance, the saint, from whom this message <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>96<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> had been sent, consented to absolve the prince and govern the church of Constantinople. Untamed by disgrace and hardened by solitude, the shepherd was again odious to the flock; and his enemies contrived a singular and, as it proved, a successful mode of revenge. In the night they stole away the foot-stool or foot-cloth of his throne, which they secretly replaced with the decoration of a satirical picture. The emperor was painted with a bridle in his mouth, and Athanasius leading the tractable beast to the feet of Christ. The authors of the libel were detected and punished; but, as their lives had been spared, the Christian priest in sullen indignation retired to his cell; and the eyes of Andronicus, which had been opened for a moment, were again closed by his successor.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_310">If this transaction be one of the most curious and important of a reign of fifty years, I cannot at least accuse the brevity of my materials, since I reduce into some few pages the enormous folios of Pachymer,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_191" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_191_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> Cantacuzene,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_192" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_192_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">4</a> and Nicephorus Gregoras,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_193" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_193_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">5</a> who have composed the prolix and languid story of the times. The name and situation of the emperor John Cantacuzene might inspire the most lively curiosity. His memorials of forty years extend from the revolt of the younger Andronicus to his own abdication of the empire; and it is observed that, like Moses and C=C3=A6sar, he was the principal actor in the scenes which he describes. But in this eloquent work we should vainly seek the sincerity of an hero or a penitent. <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>97<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> Retired in a cloister from the vices and passions of the world, he presents not a confession, but an apology, of the life of an ambitious statesman. Instead of unfolding the true counsels and characters of men, he displays the smooth and specious surface of events, highly varnished with his own praises and those of his friends. Their motives are always pure; their ends always legitimate; they conspire and rebel without any views of interest; and the violence which they inflict or suffer is celebrated as the spontaneous effect of reason and virtue.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_311">After the example of the first of the Pal=C3=A6ologi, the elder Andronicus associated his son Michael to the honours of the purple; and, from the age of eighteen to his premature death, that prince was acknowledged, above twenty-five years, as the second emperor of the Greeks.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_194" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_194_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">6</a> At the head of an army, he excited neither the fears of the enemy nor the jealousy of the court; his modesty and patience were never tempted to compute the years of his father; nor was that father compelled to repent of his liberality either by the virtues or vices of his son. The son of Michael was named Andronicus from his grandfather, to whose early favour he was introduced by that nominal resemblance. The blossoms of wit and beauty increased the fondness of the elder Andronicus; and, with the common vanity of the age, he expected to realise in the second, the hope which had been disappointed in the first, generation. The boy was educated in the palace as an heir and a favourite; and, in the oaths and acclamations of the people, the <i>august triad</i> was formed by the names of the father, the son, and the grandson. But the younger Andronicus was speedily corrupted by his infant greatness, while he beheld, with puerile impatience, the double obstacle that hung, and <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>98<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> might long hang, over his rising ambition. It was not to acquire fame, or to diffuse happiness, that he so eagerly aspired; wealth and impunity were in his eyes the most precious attributes of a monarch; and his first indiscreet demand was the sovereignty of some rich and fertile island, where he might lead a life of independence and pleasure. The emperor was offended by the loud and frequent intemperance which disturbed his capital; the sums which his parsimony denied were supplied by the Genoese usurers of Pera; and the oppressive debt, which consolidated the interest of a faction, could be discharged only by a revolution. A beautiful female, a matron in rank, a prostitute in manners, had instructed the younger Andronicus in the rudiments of love; but he had reason to suspect the nocturnal visits of a rival; and a stranger passing through the street was pierced by the arrows of his guards, who were placed in ambush at her door. That stranger was his brother, Prince Manuel, who languished and died of his wound; and the emperor Michael, their common father, whose health was in a declining state, expired on the eighth day, lamenting the loss of both his children.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_195" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_195_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">7</a> However guiltless in his intention, the younger Andronicus might impute a brother=E2=80=99s and a father=E2=80=99s death to the consequence of his own vices; and deep was the sigh of thinking and feeling men, when they perceived, instead of sorrow and repentance, his ill-dissembled joy on the removal of two odious competitors. By these melancholy events, and the increase of his disorders, the mind of the elder emperor was gradually alienated; and, after many fruitless reproofs, he transferred on another grandson<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_196" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_196_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">8</a> his <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>99<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> hopes and affection. The change was announced by the new oath of allegiance to the reigning sovereign and the <i>person</i> whom he should appoint for his successor; and the acknowledged heir, after a repetition of insults and complaints, was exposed to the indignity of a public trial. Before the sentence, which would probably have condemned him to a dungeon or a cell, the emperor was informed that the palace courts were filled with the armed followers of his grandson; the judgment was softened to a treaty of reconciliation; and the triumphant escape of the prince encouraged the ardour of the younger faction.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_312">Yet the capital, the clergy, and the senate adhered to the person, or at least to the government, of the old emperor; and it was only in the provinces, by flight, and revolt, and foreign succour, that the malecontents could hope to vindicate their cause and subvert his throne. The soul of the enterprise was the great domestic, John Cantacuzene; the sally from Constantinople is the first date of his actions and memorials; and, if his own pen be most descriptive of his patriotism, an unfriendly historian has not refused to celebrate the zeal and ability which he displayed in the service of the young emperor. That prince escaped from the capital under the pretence of hunting; erected his standard at Hadrianople; and, in a few days, assembled fifty thousand horse and foot, whom neither honour nor duty could have armed against the Barbarians. Such a force might have saved or commanded the empire; but their counsels were discordant, their motions were slow and doubtful, and their progress was checked by intrigue and negotiation. The quarrel of the two Andronici was protracted, and suspended, and renewed, during a ruinous period of seven years. In the first treaty the relics of the Greek empire were divided: Constantinople, Thessalonica, and the islands were left to the elder, while the younger acquired the sovereignty of the greatest part of Thrace, from Philippi to the Byzantine limit. By the second treaty he stipulated the payment of his troops, his immediate coronation, and an <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>100<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> adequate share of the power and revenue of the state. The third civil war was terminated by the surprise of Constantinople, the final retreat of the old emperor, and the sole reign of his victorious grandson. The reasons of this delay may be found in the characters of the men and of the times. When the heir of the monarchy first pleaded his wrongs and his apprehensions, he was heard with pity and applause; and his adherents repeated on all sides the inconsistent promise that he would increase the pay of the soldiers and alleviate the burdens of the people. The grievances of forty years were mingled in his revolt; and the rising generation was fatigued by the endless prospect of a reign whose favourites and maxims were of other times. The youth of Andronicus had been without spirit, his age was without reverence; his taxes produced an annual revenue of five hundred thousand pounds; yet the richest of the sovereigns of Christendom was incapable of maintaining three thousand horse and twenty galleys, to resist the destructive progress of the Turks.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_197" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_197_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">9</a> =E2=80=9CHow different,=E2=80=9D said the younger Andronicus, =E2=80=9Cis my situation from that of the son of Philip! Alexander might complain that his father would leave him nothing to conquer; alas! my grandsire will leave me nothing to lose.=E2=80=9D But the Greeks were soon admonished that the public disorders could not be healed by a civil war; and their young favourite was not destined to be the saviour of a falling empire. On the first repulse, his party was broken by his own levity, their intestine discord, and the intrigues of the ancient court, which tempted each malecontent to desert or betray the cause of rebellion. Andronicus the Younger was touched with remorse, or fatigued with business, or deceived by negotiation; pleasure rather than power was his aim; and the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>101<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> licence of maintaining a thousand hounds, a thousand hawks, and a thousand huntsmen was sufficient to sully his fame and disarm his ambition.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_313">Let us now survey the catastrophe of this busy plot and the final situation of the principal actors.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_198" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_198_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">10</a> The age of Andronicus was consumed in civil discord; and, amidst the events of war and treaty, his power and reputation continually decayed, till the fatal night in which the gates of the city and palace were opened without resistance to his grandson. His principal commander scorned the repeated warnings of danger; and retiring to rest in the vain security of ignorance, abandoned the feeble monarch, with some priests and pages, to the terrors of a sleepless night. These terrors were quickly realised by the hostile shouts which proclaimed the titles and victory of Andronicus the Younger; and the aged emperor, falling prostrate before an image of the Virgin, despatched a suppliant message to resign the sceptre and to obtain his life at the hands of the conqueror. The answer of his grandson was decent and pious; at the prayer of his friends, the younger Andronicus assumed the sole administration; but the elder still enjoyed the name and pre-eminence of the first emperor, the use of the great palace, and a pension of twenty-four thousand pieces of gold, one half of which was assigned on the royal treasure, and the other on the fishery of Constantinople. But his impotence was soon exposed to contempt and oblivion; the vast silence of the palace was disturbed only by the cattle and poultry of the neighbourhood, which roved with impunity through the solitary courts; and a reduced allowance of ten thousand pieces of gold<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_199" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_199_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">11</a> was all that he <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>102<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> could ask and more than he could hope. His calamities were embittered by the gradual extinction of sight: his confinement was rendered each day more rigorous; and during the absence and sickness of his grandson, his inhuman keepers, by the threats of instant death, compelled him to exchange the purple for the monastic habit and profession. The monk <i>Antony</i> had renounced the pomp of the world: yet he had occasion for a coarse fur in the winter-season; and, as wine was forbidden by his confessor, and water by his physician, the sherbet of Egypt was his common drink. It was not without difficulty that the late emperor could procure three or four pieces to satisfy these simple wants; and, if he bestowed the gold to relieve the more painful distress of a friend, the sacrifice is of some weight in the scale of humanity and religion. Four years after his abdication, Andronicus, or Antony, expired in a cell, in the seventy-fourth year of his age; and the last strain of adulation could only promise a more splendid crown of glory in heaven than he had enjoyed upon earth.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_200" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_200_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">12</a></p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_314">Nor was the reign of the younger, more glorious or fortunate than that of the elder, Andronicus.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_201" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_201_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">13</a> He gathered the fruits of ambition: but the taste was transient and bitter; in the supreme station he lost the remains of his early popularity; and the defects of his character became still more conspicuous to the world. The public reproach urged him to march in person against the Turks; nor did his courage fail in the hour of trial; but a defeat and wound were the only trophies of his expedition in Asia, which confirmed the establishment of the Ottoman monarchy. The abuses of the civil government <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>103<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> attained their full maturity and perfection; his neglect of forms, and the confusion of national dresses, are deplored by the Greeks as the fatal symptoms of the decay of the empire. Andronicus was old before his time; the intemperance of youth had accelerated the infirmities of age; and, after being rescued from a dangerous malady by nature, or physic, or the Virgin, he was snatched away before he had accomplished his forty-fifth year. He was twice married; and, as the progress of the Latins in arms and arts had softened the prejudices of the Byzantine court, his two wives were chosen in the princely houses of Germany and Italy. The first, Agnes at home, Irene in Greece, was daughter of the duke of Brunswick.

We have seen that the young emperor was saved by Cantacuzene from the power of his grandfather; and, after six years of civil war, the same favourite brought him back in triumph to the palace of Constantinople. Under the reign of Andronicus the Younger, the great domestic ruled the emperor and the empire; and it was by his valour and conduct that the isle of Lesbos and the principality of =C3=86tolia were restored to their ancient allegiance. His enemies confess that, among the public robbers, Cantacuzene alone was moderate and abstemious; and the free and voluntary account which he produces of his own wealth<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_210" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_210_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">22</a> may sustain the presumption that it was devolved by inheritance, and not accumulated by rapine. He does not indeed specify the value of his money, plate, and jewels; yet, after a voluntary gift of two hundred vases of silver, after much had been secreted by his friends and plundered by his foes, his forfeit treasures were sufficient for the equipment of a fleet of seventy galleys. He does not measure the size and number of his estates; but his granaries were heaped with an incredible store of wheat and barley; and the labour of a thousand yoke of oxen might cultivate, according to the practice of antiquity, about sixty-two thousand five hundred acres of arable land.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_211" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_211_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">23</a> His pastures were stocked with two thousand five hundred brood mares, two hundred camels, three hundred mules, five hundred asses, five thousand horned cattle, fifty thousand hogs, and seventy thousand sheep:<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_212" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_212_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">24</a> a precious record of <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>106<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> rural opulence, in the last period of the empire, and in a land, most probably in Thrace, so repeatedly wasted by foreign and domestic hostility. The favour of Cantacuzene was above his fortune. In the moments of familiarity, in the hour of sickness, the emperor was desirous to level the distance between them, and pressed his friend to accept the diadem and purple. The virtue of the great domestic, which is attested by his own pen, resisted the dangerous proposal; but the last testament of Andronicus the Younger named him the guardian of his son and the regent of the empire.</p>

The prospect of a tranquil minority was blasted by the Great Duke or Admiral Apocaucus; and, to exaggerate <i>his</i> perfidy, the Imperial historian is pleased to magnify his own imprudence in raising him to that office against the advice of his more sagacious sovereign. Bold and subtle, rapacious and profuse, the avarice and ambition of Apocaucus were by turns subservient to each other; and his talents were applied to the ruin of his country. His arrogance was heightened by the command of a naval force and an impregnable castle, and, under the mask of oaths and flattery, he secretly conspired against his benefactor. The female court of the empress was bribed and directed; he encouraged Anne of Savoy to assert, <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>107<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> by the law of nature, the tutelage of her son; the love of power was disguised by the anxiety of maternal tenderness; and the founder of the Pal=C3=A6ologi had instructed his posterity to dread the example of a perfidious guardian. The patriarch John of Apri was a proud and feeble old man, encompassed by a numerous and hungry kindred. He produced an obsolete epistle of Andronicus, which bequeathed the prince and people to his pious care: the fate of his predecessor Arsenius prompted him to prevent, rather than punish, the crimes of an usurper; and Apocaucus smiled at the success of his own flattery, when he beheld the Byzantine priest assuming the state and temporal claims of the Roman pontiff.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_214" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_214_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">26</a> Between three persons so different in their situation and character, a private league was concluded: a shadow of authority was restored to the senate; and the people was tempted by the name of freedom. By this powerful confederacy, the great domestic was assaulted at first with clandestine, at length with open, arms. His prerogatives were disputed; his opinions slighted; his friends persecuted; and his safety was threatened both in the camp and city. In his absence on the public service, he was accused of treason; proscribed as an enemy of the church and state; and delivered, with all his adherents, to the sword of justice, the vengeance of the people, and the power of the devil: his fortunes were confiscated; his aged mother was cast into prison; all his past services were buried in oblivion; and he was driven by injustice to perpetrate the crime of which he was accused.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_215" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_215_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">27</a> From the review of his preceding conduct, Cantacuzene appears to have been guiltless of any treasonable designs; and <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>108<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> the only suspicion of his innocence must arise from the vehemence of his protestations, and the sublime purity which he ascribes to his own virtue. While the empress and the patriarch still affected the appearance of harmony, he repeatedly solicited the permission of retiring to a private, and even a monastic, life. After he had been declared a public enemy, it was his fervent wish to throw himself at the feet of the young emperor, and to receive without a murmur the stroke of the executioner: it was not without reluctance that he listened to the voice of reason, which inculcated the sacred duty of saving his family and friends, and proved that he could only save them by drawing the sword and assuming the Imperial title.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_317">In the strong city of Demotica, his peculiar domain, the emperor John Cantacuzenus was invested with the purple buskins; his right leg was clothed by his noble kinsmen, the left by the Latin chiefs, on whom he conferred the order of knighthood. But even in this act of revolt he was still studious of loyalty; and the titles of John Pal=C3=A6ologus and Anne of Savoy were proclaimed before his own name and that of his wife Irene. Such vain ceremony is a thin disguise of rebellion, nor are there perhaps any <i>personal</i> wrongs that can authorise a subject to take arms against his sovereign; but the want of preparation and success may confirm the assurance of the usurper that this decisive step was the effect of necessity rather than of choice. Constantinople adhered to the young emperor; the king of Bulgaria was invited to the relief of Hadrianople; the principal cities of Thrace and Macedonia, after some hesitation, renounced their obedience to the great domestic; and the leaders of the troops and provinces were induced, by their private interest, to prefer the loose dominion of a woman and a priest.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_216" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_216_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">28</a> The army of Cantacuzene, in sixteen divisions, was stationed on the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>109<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> banks of the Melas, to tempt or intimidate the capital; it was dispersed by treachery or fear; and the officers, more especially the mercenary Latins, accepted the bribes, and embraced the service, of the Byzantine court. After this loss, the rebel emperor (he fluctuated between the two characters) took the road of Thessalonica with a chosen remnant; but he failed in his enterprise on that important place; and he was closely pursued by the Great Duke, his enemy Apocaucus, at the head of a superior power by sea and land. Driven from the coast, in his march, or rather flight, into the mountains of Servia, Cantacuzene assembled his troops to scrutinise those who were worthy and willing to accompany his broken fortunes. A base majority bowed and retired; and his trusty band was diminished to two thousand, and at last to five hundred, volunteers.

The most tempting offers could not persuade the cral to violate his trust; but he soon inclined to the stronger side; and his friend was dismissed without injury to a new vicissitude of hopes and perils.

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_318">The introduction of barbarians and savages into the contests of civilised nations is a measure pregnant with shame and mischief; which the interest of the moment may compel, but which is reprobated by the best principles of humanity and reason. It is the practice of both sides to accuse their enemies of the guilt of the first alliances; and those who fail in their negotiations are loudest in their censure of the example which they envy and would gladly imitate. The Turks of Asia were less barbarous, perhaps, than the shepherds of Bulgaria and Servia;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_219" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_219_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">31</a> but their religion rendered them the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>111<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> implacable foes of Rome and Christianity. To acquire the friendship of their emirs, the two factions vied with each other in baseness and profusion; the dexterity of Cantacuzene obtained the preference; but the succour and victory were dearly purchased by the marriage of his daughter with an infidel, the captivity of many thousand Christians, and the passage of the Ottomans into Europe, the last and fatal stroke in the fall of the Roman empire. The inclining scale was decided in his favour by the death of Apocaucus, the just, though singular, retribution of his crimes. A crowd of nobles or plebeians, whom he feared or hated, had been seized by his orders in the capital and the provinces; and the old palace of Constantine was assigned for the place of their confinement. Some alterations in raising the walls and narrowing the cells had been ingeniously contrived to prevent their escape and aggravate their misery; and the work was incessantly pressed by the daily visits of the tyrant. His guards watched at the gate, and, as he stood in the inner court to overlook the architects, without fear or suspicion, he was assaulted and laid breathless on the ground, by two resolute prisoners of the Pal=C3=A6ologian race,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_220" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_220_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">32</a> who were armed <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>112<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> with sticks and animated by despair. On the rumour of revenge and liberty, the captive multitude broke their fetters, fortified their prison, and exposed from the battlements the tyrant=E2=80=99s head, presuming on the favour of the people and the clemency of the empress. Anne of Savoy might rejoice in the fall of an haughty and ambitious minister; but, while she delayed to resolve or to act, the populace, more especially the mariners, were excited by the widow of the Great Duke to a sedition, an assault, and a massacre. The prisoners (of whom the far greater part were guiltless or inglorious of the deed) escaped to a neighbouring church; they were slaughtered at the foot of the altar; and in his death the monster was not less bloody and venomous than in his life. Yet his talents alone upheld the cause of the young emperor; and his surviving associates, suspicious of each other, abandoned the conduct of the war, and rejected the fairest terms of accommodation. In the beginning of the dispute, the empress felt and complained that she was deceived by the enemies of Cantacuzene; the patriarch was employed to preach against the forgiveness of injuries; and her promise of immortal hatred was sealed by an oath under the penalty of excommunication.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_221" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_221_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">33</a> But Anne soon learned to hate without a teacher: she beheld the misfortunes of the empire with the indifference of a stranger: her jealousy was exasperated by the competition of a rival empress; and, on the first symptoms of a more yielding temper, she threatened the patriarch to convene a synod and degrade him from his office. Their incapacity and discord would have afforded the most decisive advantage; but the civil war was protracted by the weakness <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>113<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> of both parties; and the moderation of Cantacuzene has not escaped the reproach of timidity and indolence.

An Italian, of the name of Facciolati,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_223" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_223_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">35</a> had <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>114<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> succeeded to the office of Great Duke: the ships, the guards, and the golden gate were subject to his command; but his humble ambition was bribed to become the instrument of treachery; and the revolution was accomplished without danger or bloodshed. Destitute of the powers of resistance or the hope of relief, the inflexible Anne would have still defended the palace, and have smiled to behold the capital in flames, rather than in the possession of a rival. She yielded to the prayers of her friends and enemies; and the treaty was dictated by the conqueror, who professed a loyal and zealous attachment to the son of his benefactor. The marriage of his daughter with John Pal=C3=A6ologus was at length consummated: the hereditary right of the pupil was acknowledged; but the sole administration during ten years was vested in the guardian. Two emperors and three empresses were seated on the Byzantine throne; and a general amnesty quieted the apprehensions, and confirmed the property, of the most guilty subjects. The festival of the coronation and nuptials was celebrated with the appearance of concord and magnificence, and both were equally fallacious. During the late troubles, the treasures of the state, and even the palace, had been alienated or embezzled: the royal banquet was served in pewter or earthenware; and such was the proud poverty of the times that the absence of gold and jewels was supplied by the paltry artifices of glass and gilt leather.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_224" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_224_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">36</a></p>

His followers might style the general amnesty <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>115<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> an act of pardon for his enemies and of oblivion for his friends:<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_226" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_226_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">38</a> in his cause their estates had been forfeited or plundered; and, as they wandered naked and hungry through the streets, they cursed the selfish generosity of a leader who, on the throne of the empire, might relinquish without merit his private inheritance. The adherents of the empress blushed to hold their lives and fortunes by the precarious favour of an usurper; and the thirst of revenge was concealed by a tender concern for the succession, and even the safety, of her son. They were justly alarmed by a petition of the friends of Cantacuzene, that they might be released from their oath of allegiance to the Pal=C3=A6ologi and entrusted with the defence of some cautionary towns: a measure supported with argument and eloquence; and which was rejected (says the Imperial historian) =E2=80=9Cby <i>my</i> sublime and almost incredible virtue.=E2=80=9D His repose was disturbed by the sound of plots and seditions; and he trembled lest the lawful prince should be stolen away by some foreign or domestic enemy, who would inscribe his name and his wrongs in the banners of rebellion. As the son of Andronicus advanced in the years of manhood, he began to feel and to act for himself; and his rising ambition was rather stimulated than checked by the imitation of his father=E2=80=99s vices. If we may trust his own professions, Cantacuzene laboured with honest industry to correct these sordid and sensual appetites, and to raise the mind of the young prince to a level with his fortune. In the Servian expedition<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_227" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_227_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">39</a> the two emperors showed themselves in cordial harmony to the troops and provinces; and <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>116<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> the younger colleague was initiated by the elder in the mysteries of war and government. After the conclusion of the peace, Pal=C3=A6ologus was left at Thessalonica, a royal residence and a frontier station, to secure by his absence the peace of Constantinople, and to withdraw his youth from the temptations of a luxurious capital. But the distance weakened the powers of control, and the son of Andronicus was surrounded with artful or unthinking companions, who taught him to hate his guardian, to deplore his exile, and to vindicate his rights. A private treaty with the cral or despot of Servia was soon followed by an open revolt; and Cantacuzene, on the throne of the elder Andronicus, defended the cause of age and prerogative, which in his youth he had so vigorously attacked. At his request, the empress-mother undertook the voyage of Thessalonica, and the office of mediation: she returned without success; and unless Anne of Savoy was instructed by adversity, we may doubt the sincerity, or at least the fervour, of her zeal. While the regent grasped the sceptre with a firm and vigorous hand, she had been instructed to declare that the ten years of his legal administration would soon elapse; and that, after a full trial of the vanity of the world, the emperor Cantacuzene sighed for the repose of a cloister, and was ambitious only of an heavenly crown. Had these sentiments been genuine, his voluntary abdication would have restored the peace of the empire, and his conscience would have been relieved by an act of justice. Pal=C3=A6ologus alone was responsible for his future government; and, whatever might be his vices, they were surely less formidable than the calamities of a civil war, in which the Barbarians and infidels were again invited to assist the Greeks in their mutual destruction. By the arms of the Turks, who now struck a <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>117<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> deep and everlasting root in Europe, Cantacuzene prevailed in the third conquest in which he had been involved; and the young emperor, driven from the sea and land, was compelled to take shelter among the Latins of the isle of Tenedos. His insolence and obstinacy provoked the victor to a step which must render the quarrel irreconcileable; and the association of his son Matthew, whom he invested with the purple, established the succession in the family of the Cantacuzeni. But Constantinople was still attached to the blood of her ancient princes; and this last injury accelerated the restoration of the rightful heir. A noble Genoese espoused the cause of Pal=C3=A6ologus, obtained a promise of his sister, and achieved the revolution with two galleys and two thousand five hundred auxiliaries. Under the pretence of distress they were admitted into the lesser port; a gate was opened, and the Latin shout of =E2=80=9CLong life and victory to the emperor John Pal=C3=A6ologus!=E2=80=9D was answered by a general rising in his favour. A numerous and loyal party yet adhered to the standard of Cantacuzene; but he asserts in his history (does he hope for belief?) that his tender conscience rejected the assurance of conquest: that, in free obedience to the voice of religion and philosophy, he descended from the throne and embraced with pleasure the monastic habit and profession.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_228" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_228_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">40</a> So soon as he ceased to be a prince, his successor was not unwilling that he should be a saint; the remainder of his life was devoted to piety and learning; in the cells of Constantinople and Mount Athos, the monk Joasaph was respected as the temporal and spiritual father of the emperor; and, if he issued from his retreat, it was as the minister of peace, to subdue the obstinacy, and solicit the pardon, of his rebellious son.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_229" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_229_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">41</a></p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_320">Yet in the cloister, the mind of Cantacuzene was still exercised by theological war. He sharpened a controversial pen against the Jews and Mahometans;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_230" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_230_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">42</a> and in every state he defended with equal zeal the divine light of Mount Thabor, a memorable question which consummates the religious follies of the Greeks.

At first, all will be dark and comfortless; but, if you persevere day and night, you will feel an ineffable joy; and no sooner has the soul discovered the place of the heart than it is involved in a mystic and ethereal light.=E2=80=9D This light, the production of a distempered fancy, the creature of an empty stomach and an empty brain, was adored by the Quietists as the pure and <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>119<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> perfect essence of God himself; and, as long as the folly was confined to Mount Athos, the simple solitaries were not inquisitive how the divine essence could be a <i>material</i> substance, or how an <i>immaterial</i> substance could be perceived by the eyes of the body. But in the reign of the younger Andronicus these monasteries were visited by Barlaam,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_233" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_233_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">45</a> a Calabrian monk, who was equally skilled in philosophy and theology; who possessed the languages of the Greeks and Latins; and whose versatile genius could maintain their opposite creeds, according to the interest of the moment. The indiscretion of an ascetic revealed to the curious traveller the secrets of mental prayer; and Barlaam embraced the opportunity of ridiculing the Quietists, who placed the soul in the navel; of accusing the monks of Mount Athos of heresy and blasphemy. His attack compelled the more learned to renounce or dissemble the simple devotion of their brethren; and Gregory Palamas introduced a scholastic distinction between the essence and operation of God.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_234" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_234_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">46</a> His inaccessible essence dwells in the midst of an uncreated and eternal light; and this beatific vision of the saints had been manifested to the disciples on Mount Thabor, in the transfiguration of Christ. Yet this distinction could not escape the reproach of polytheism; the eternity of the light of Thabor was fiercely denied; and Barlaam still charged the Palamites with holding two eternal substances, a visible and an invisible God. From the rage <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>120<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> of the monks of Mount Athos, who threatened his life, the Calabrian retired to Constantinople, where his smooth and specious manners introduced him to the favour of the great domestic and the emperor. The court and the city were involved in this theological dispute, which flamed amidst the civil war; but the doctrine of Barlaam was disgraced by his flight and apostacy; the Palamites triumphed; and their adversary, the patriarch John of Apri, was deposed by the consent of the adverse factions of the state. In the character of emperor and theologian, Cantacuzene presided in the synod of the Greek church, which established, as an article of faith, the uncreated light of Mount Thabor; and, after so many insults, the reason of mankind was slightly wounded by the addition of a single absurdity. Many rolls of paper or parchment have been blotted; and the impenitent sectaries, who refused to subscribe the orthodox creed, were deprived of the honours of Christian burial; but in the next age the question was forgotten; nor can I learn that the axe or the faggot were employed for the extirpation of the Barlaamite heresy.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_235" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_235_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">47</a></p>

Genoa sealed a firm alliance with the Greeks; and, in case of a defensive war, a supply of fifty empty galleys, and a succour of fifty galleys completely armed and manned, was promised by the republic to the empire. In the revival of a naval force it was the aim of Michael Pal=C3=A6ologus to deliver himself from a foreign aid; and his vigorous government contained the Genoese of Galata within those limits which the insolence of wealth and freedom provoked them to exceed. A sailor threatened that they should soon be masters of Constantinople, and slew the Greek who resented this national affront; and an armed vessel, after refusing to salute the palace, was guilty of some acts of piracy in the Black Sea. Their countrymen threatened to support their cause; but the long and open village of Galata was instantly surrounded by the Imperial troops; till, in the moment of the assault, the prostrate Genoese implored the clemency of their sovereign. The defenceless situation which secured their obedience exposed them to the attack of their Venetian rivals, who, in the reign of the elder Andronicus, presumed to violate the majesty of the throne. On the approach of their fleets, the Genoese, with their families and effects, retired into the city; their empty habitations were reduced to ashes; and the feeble prince, who had viewed the destruction of his suburb, expressed his resentment, not by arms, but by ambassadors. This misfortune, however, was advantageous to the Genoese, who obtained, and imperceptibly abused, the dangerous licence of surrounding Galata with a strong wall; of introducing into the ditch the waters of the sea; of erecting lofty turrets; and of mounting a train of military engines on the rampart. The narrow bounds in which they had been circumscribed were insufficient for the growing colony; each day they acquired some addition of landed property; and the adjacent hills were covered with their villas and castles, which they joined and protected by <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>122<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> new fortifications.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_237" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_237_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">49</a> The navigation and trade of the Euxine was the patrimony of the Greek emperors, who commanded the narrow entrance, the gates, as it were, of that inland sea.

Destitute of a navy, the Greeks were oppressed by these haughty merchants, who fed or famished Constantinople, according to their interest. They proceeded to usurp the customs, the fishery, and even the toll of the Bosphorus; and, while they derived from these objects a revenue of two hundred thousand pieces of gold, a remnant of thirty thousand was reluctantly allowed to the emperor.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_242" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_242_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">54</a> The colony of Pera or Galata acted, in peace and war, as an independent state; and, as it will happen in distant settlements, the Genoese podest=C3=A0 too often forgot that he was the servant of his own masters.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_322">These usurpations were encouraged by the weakness of the elder Andronicus, and by the civil wars that afflicted his age and the minority of his grandson. The talents of Cantacuzene were employed to the ruin, rather than the restoration, of the empire; and after his domestic victory he was condemned to an ignominious trial, whether the Greeks or the Genoese should reign in Constantinople. The merchants of Pera were offended by his refusal of some contiguous lands, some commanding heights, which they proposed to cover with new fortifications; and in the absence of the emperor, who was detained at Demotica by sickness, they ventured to brave <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>124<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> the debility of a female reign. A Byzantine vessel, which had presumed to fish at the mouth of the harbour, was sunk by these audacious strangers; the fishermen were murdered. Instead of suing for pardon, the Genoese demanded satisfaction; required, in an haughty strain, that the Greeks should renounce the exercise of navigation; and encountered, with regular arms, the first sallies of the popular indignation. They instantly occupied the debateable land; and by the labour of a whole people, of either sex and of every age, the wall was raised, and the ditch was sunk, with incredible speed. At the same time they attacked and burnt two Byzantine galleys; while the three others, the remainder of the Imperial navy, escaped from their hand; the habitations without the gates, or along the shore, were pillaged and destroyed; and the care of the regent, of the empress Irene, was confined to the preservation of the city. The return of Cantacuzene dispelled the public consternation: the emperor inclined to peaceful counsels; but he yielded to the obstinacy of his enemies, who rejected all reasonable terms, and to the ardour of his subjects, who threatened, in the style of scripture, to break them in pieces like a potter=E2=80=99s vessel. Yet they reluctantly paid the taxes that he imposed for the construction of ships and the expenses of the war; and, as the two nations were masters, the one of the land, the other of the sea, Constantinople and Pera were pressed by the evils of a mutual siege. The merchants of the colony, who had believed that a few days would terminate the war, already murmured at their losses; the succours from their mother-country were delayed by the factions of Genoa; and the most cautious embraced the opportunity of a Rhodian vessel to remove their families and effects from the scene of hostility. In the spring, the Byzantine fleet, seven galleys and a train of smaller vessels, issued from the mouth of the harbour and steered in a single line along the shore of Pera; unskilfully presenting their sides to the beaks of the adverse squadron. The crews were composed of peasants and mechanics; nor was their ignorance <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>125<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> compensated by the native courage of Barbarians. The wind was strong, the waves were rough; and no sooner did the Greeks perceive a distant and inactive enemy, than they leaped headlong into the sea, from a doubtful to an inevitable peril. The troops that marched to the attack of the lines of Pera were struck at the same moment with a similar panic; and the Genoese were astonished, and almost ashamed, at their double victory. Their triumphant vessels, crowned with flowers, and dragging after them the captive galleys, repeatedly passed and repassed before the palace. The only virtue of the emperor was patience, and the hope of revenge his sole consolation. Yet the distress of both parties interposed a temporary agreement; and the shame of the empire was disguised by a thin veil of dignity and power. Summoning the chiefs of the colony, Cantacuzene affected to despise the trivial object of the debate; and, after a mild reproof, most liberally granted the lands, which had been previously resigned to the seeming custody of his officers.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_243" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_243_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">55</a></p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_323">But the emperor was soon solicited to violate the treaty, and to join his arms with the Venetians, the perpetual enemies of Genoa and her colonies. While he compared the reasons of peace and war, his moderation was provoked by a wanton insult of the inhabitants of Pera, who discharged from their rampart a large stone that fell in the midst of Constantinople. On his just complaint, they coldly blamed the imprudence of their engineer; but the next day the insult was repeated, and they exulted in a second proof that the royal city was not beyond the reach of their artillery. Cantacuzene instantly signed his treaty with the Venetians; but the weight of the Roman empire was scarcely felt in the balance of these opulent and powerful republics.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_244" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_244_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">56</a> From the straits of Gibraltar to the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>126<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> mouth of the Tanais, their fleets encountered each other with various success; and a memorable battle was fought in the narrow sea, under the walls of Constantinople.

The Venetians, with their allies, the Catalans, had the advantage of number; and their fleet, with the poor addition of eight Byzantine galleys, amounted to seventy-five sail; the Genoese did not exceed sixty-four; but in those times their ships of war were distinguished by the superiority of their size and strength. The names and families of their naval commanders, Pisani and Doria, are illustrious in the annals of their country; but the personal merit of the former was eclipsed by the fame and abilities of his rival. They engaged in tempestuous weather; and the tumultuary conflict was continued from the dawn to the extinction of light. The enemies of the Genoese applaud their prowess; the friends of the Venetians are dissatisfied with their behaviour; but all parties agree in praising the skill and boldness of the Catalans, who, with many wounds, sustained the brunt of the action. On the separation of the fleets, the event might appear doubtful; but the thirteen Genoese galleys, that had been sunk or taken, were compensated by a double loss of the allies: of fourteen Venetians, ten Catalans, and two Greeks; and even the grief of the conquerors expressed <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>none<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>127<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> the assurance and habit of more decisive victories. Pisani confessed his defeat by retiring into a fortified harbour, from whence, under the pretext of the orders of the senate, he steered with a broken and flying squadron for the isle of Candia, and abandoned to his rivals the sovereignty of the sea. In a public epistle,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_247" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_247_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">59</a> addressed to the doge and senate, Petrarch employs his eloquence to reconcile the maritime powers, the two luminaries of Italy. The orator celebrates the valour and victory of the Genoese, the first of men in the exercise of naval war; he drops a tear on the misfortunes of their Venetian brethren; but he exhorts them to pursue with fire and sword the base and perfidious Greeks; to purge the metropolis of the East from the heresy with which it was infected. Deserted by their friends, the Greeks were incapable of resistance; and, three months after the battle, the emperor Cantacuzene solicited and subscribed a treaty, which for ever banished the Venetians and Catalans, and granted to the Genoese a monopoly of trade and almost a right of dominion.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_248" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_248_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">60</a> The Roman empire (I smile in transcribing the name) might soon have sunk into a province of Genoa, if the ambition of the republic had not been checked by the ruin of her freedom and naval power. A long contest of one hundred and thirty years was determined by the triumph of Venice; and the factions of the Genoese compelled them to seek for domestic peace under the protection of a foreign lord, the duke of Milan, or the French king. Yet the spirit of commerce survived that of conquest; and the colony of Pera still awed the capital, and navigated the Euxine, till it was involved by the Turks in the final servitude of Constantinople itself.</p>

The rise and progress of the Ottomans, the present sovereigns of Constantinople, are connected with the most important scenes of modern history; but they are founded on a previous knowledge of the great eruption of the Moguls and Tartars, whose rapid conquests may be compared with the primitive convulsions of nature, which have agitated and altered the surface of the globe.

In his ascent to greatness, that Barbarian (whose private appellation was Temugin) had trampled on the necks of his equals. His birth was noble; but it was in the pride of victory that the prince or people deduced his seventh ancestor from the immaculate conception of a virgin.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_250" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_250_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> His father had reigned over thirteen hordes, which composed about thirty or forty thousand families; above two-thirds refused to pay tithes or obedience to his infant son; and, at the age of thirteen, Temugin fought a battle against his rebellious subjects. The future conqueror of Asia was reduced to fly and to obey; but he rose superior to his fortune; and, in his fortieth year, he had established his fame and dominion over the circumjacent tribes. In a state of society in which policy is rude and valour is universal, the ascendant of one man must be founded on his power and resolution to punish his enemies and recompense his friends. His first military league was ratified by the simple rites of sacrificing an horse and tasting of a running stream: Temugin pledged himself to divide with his followers the sweets and the bitters of life; and, when he had shared among them his horses and apparel, he was rich in their gratitude and his own hopes. After his first victory, he placed seventy caldrons on the fire, and seventy of the most guilty rebels were cast headlong into the boiling water.

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_327">The code of laws which Zingis dictated to his subjects was adapted to the preservation of domestic peace and the exercise of foreign hostility. The punishment of death was inflicted on the crimes of adultery, murder, perjury, and the capital thefts of an horse or ox; and the fiercest of men were mild and just in their intercourse with each other. The future election of the great khan was vested in the princes of his family and the heads of the tribes; and the regulations of the chase were essential to the pleasures and plenty of a Tartar camp. The victorious nation was held sacred from all servile labours, which were abandoned to slaves and strangers; and every labour was servile except the profession of arms. The service and discipline of the troops, who were armed with bows, scymetars, and iron maces, and divided by hundreds, thousands, and ten thousands, were the institutions of a veteran commander. Each officer and soldier was made responsible, under pain of death, for the safety and honour of his companions; and the spirit of conquest breathed in the law that peace should never be granted unless to a vanquished and suppliant enemy.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_255" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_255_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">7</a> But it is the religion of Zingis that best deserves our wonder and applause.

His first and only article of faith was the existence of one God, the author of all good, who fills, by his presence, the heavens and earth, which he has created by his power. The Tartars and Moguls were addicted to the idols of their peculiar tribes; and many of them had been converted by the foreign missionaries to the religions of Moses, of Mahomet, and of Christ.

His ancestors had been the tributaries of the Chinese emperors; and Temugin himself had been disgraced by a title of honour and servitude.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_270" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_270_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">22</a> The court of Pekin was astonished by an embassy from its former vassal, who in the tone of the king of nations exacted the tribute and obedience which he had paid, and who affected to treat the <i>Son of Heaven</i> as the most contemptible of mankind.

His invasion was supported by the revolt of an hundred thousand Khitans, who guarded the frontier; yet he listened to a treaty; and a princess of China, three thousand horses, five hundred youths, and as many virgins, and a tribute of gold and silk, were the price of his retreat.

China was desolated by Tartar war and domestic faction; and the five northern provinces were added to the empire of Zingis.</p>

A rash and inhuman deed provoked and justified the Tartar arms in the invasion of the southern Asia. A caravan of three ambassadors and one hundred and fifty merchants was arrested and murdered at Otrar,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_273" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_273_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">25</a> by the command of Mohammed; nor was it till after a demand and denial of justice, till he had prayed and fasted three nights on a mountain, that the Mogul emperor appealed to the judgment of God and his sword. Our European battles, says a philosophic writer,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_274" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_274_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">26</a> are petty skirmishes, if compared to the numbers that have fought and fallen in the fields of Asia. Seven hundred thousand Moguls and Tartars are said to have marched under the standard of Zingis and his four sons. In the vast plains that extend to the north of <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>138<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> the Sihon or Jaxartes, they were encountered by four hundred thousand soldiers of the sultan; and in the first battle, which was suspended by the night, one hundred and sixty thousand Carizmians were slain. Mohammed was astonished by the multitude and valour of his enemies:<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_275" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_275_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">27</a> he withdrew from the scene of danger, and distributed his troops in the frontier towns, trusting that the Barbarians, invincible in the field, would be repulsed by the length and difficulty of so many regular sieges. But the prudence of Zingis had formed a body of Chinese engineers, skilled in the mechanic arts, informed, perhaps, of the secret of gunpowder, and capable, under his discipline, of attacking a foreign country with more vigour and success than they had defended their own. The Persian historians will relate the sieges and reduction of Otrar, Cogende, Bochara, Samarcand, Carizme, Herat, Merou, Nisabour, Balch, and Candahar; and the conquest of the rich and populous countries of Transoxiana, Carizme, and Chorasan. The destructive hostilities of Attila and the Huns have long since been elucidated by the example of Zingis and the Moguls; and in this more proper place I shall be content to observe that, from the Caspian to the Indus, they ruined a tract of many hundred miles, which <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>139<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> was adorned with the habitations and labours of mankind, and that five centuries have not been sufficient to repair the ravages of four years. The Mogul emperor encouraged or indulged the fury of his troops; the hope of future possession was lost in the ardour of rapine and slaughter; and the cause of the war exasperated their native fierceness by the pretence of justice and revenge. The downfall and death of the sultan Mohammed, who expired unpitied and alone in a desert island of the Caspian Sea, is a poor atonement for the calamities of which he was the author. Could the Carizmian empire have been saved by a single hero, it would have been saved by his son Gelaleddin, whose active valour repeatedly checked the Moguls in the career of victory. Retreating, as he fought, to the banks of the Indus, he was oppressed by their innumerable host, till, in the last moment of despair, Gelaleddin spurred his horse into the waves, swam one of the broadest and most rapid rivers of Asia, and extorted the admiration and applause of Zingis himself. It was in this camp that the Mogul emperor yielded with reluctance to the murmurs of his weary and wealthy troops, who sighed for the enjoyment of their native land. Incumbered with the spoils of Asia, he slowly measured back his footsteps, betrayed some pity for the misery of the vanquished, and declared his intention of rebuilding the cities which had been swept away by the tempest of his arms. After he had repassed the Oxus and Jaxartes, he was joined by two generals, whom he had detached with thirty thousand horse, to subdue the western provinces of Persia. They had trampled on the nations which opposed their passage, penetrated through the gates of Derbend, traversed the Volga and the desert, and accomplished the circuit of the Caspian Sea, by an expedition which had never been attempted and has never been repeated. The return of Zingis was signalised by the overthrow of the rebellious or independent kingdoms of Tartary; and he died in the fulness of years and glory, with his last breath exhorting and <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>140<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> instructing his sons to achieve the conquest of the Chinese empire.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_331">I. Before the invasion of Zingis, China was divided into <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>141<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> two empires or dynasties of the North and South;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_279" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_279_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">31</a> and the difference of origin and interest was smoothed by a general conformity of laws, language, and national manners. The Northern empire, which had been dismembered by Zingis, was finally subdued seven years after his death. After the loss of Pekin, the emperor had fixed his residence at Kaifong, a city many leagues in circumference, and which contained, according to the Chinese annals, fourteen hundred thousand families of inhabitants and fugitives. He escaped from thence with only seven horsemen, and made his last stand in a third capital, till at length the hopeless monarch, protesting his innocence and accusing his fortune, ascended a funeral pile, and gave orders that, as soon as he had stabbed himself, the fire should be kindled by his attendants. The dynasty of the <i>Song</i>, the native and ancient sovereigns of the whole empire, survived above forty-five years the fall of the Northern usurpers; and the perfect conquest was reserved for the arms of Cublai. During this interval, the Moguls were often diverted by foreign wars; and, if the Chinese seldom dared to meet their victors in the field, their passive courage presented an endless succession of cities to storm and of millions to slaughter. In the attack and defence of places, the engines of antiquity and the Greek fire were alternately employed; the use of gunpowder, in cannon and bombs, appears as a familiar practice;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_280" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_280_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">32</a> and the sieges were conducted by the Mahometans and Franks, who had been liberally invited <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>142<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> into the service of Cublai. After passing the great river, the troops and artillery were conveyed along a series of canals, till they invested the royal residence of Hamcheu, or Quinsay, in the country of silk, the most delicious climate of China. The emperor, a defenceless youth, surrendered his person and sceptre; and, before he was sent in exile into Tartary, he struck nine times the ground with his forehead, to adore in prayer or thanksgiving the mercy of the Great Khan. Yet the war (it was now styled a rebellion) was still maintained in the southern provinces from Hamcheu to Canton; and the obstinate remnant of independence and hostility was transported from the land to the sea. But, when the fleet of the <i>Song</i> was surrounded and oppressed by a superior armament, their last champion leaped into the waves with his infant emperor in his arms. =E2=80=9CIt is more glorious,=E2=80=9D he cried, =E2=80=9Cto die a prince than to live a slave.=E2=80=9D An hundred thousand Chinese imitated his example; and the whole empire, from Tonkin to the great wall, submitted to the dominion of Cublai. His boundless ambition aspired to the conquest of Japan; his fleet was twice shipwrecked; and the lives of an hundred thousand Moguls and Chinese were sacrificed in the fruitless expedition. But the circumjacent kingdoms, Corea, Tonkin, Cochinchina, Pegu, Bengal, and Thibet, were reduced in different degrees of tribute and obedience by the effort or terror of his arms. He explored the Indian Ocean with a fleet of a thousand ships; they sailed in sixty-eight days, most probably to the isle of Borneo, under the equinoctial line; and, though they returned not without spoil or <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>143<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> glory, the emperor was dissatisfied that the savage king had escaped from their hands.</p>

The extinction of the Abbassides cannot be indifferent to the spectators of their greatness and decline. Since the fall of their Seljukian tyrants, the caliphs had recovered their lawful dominion of Bagdad and the Arabian Irak; but the city was distracted by theological factions, and the commander of the faithful was lost in a harem of seven hundred concubines. The invasion of the Moguls he encountered with feeble arms and haughty embassies. =E2=80=9COn the divine decree,=E2=80=9D said the caliph Mostasem, =E2=80=9Cis founded the throne of the sons of Abbas: and their foes shall surely be destroyed in this world and in the next. Who is this Holagou that dares to arise against them? If he be desirous of peace, let him instantly depart from the sacred territory, and perhaps he may obtain from our clemency the pardon of his fault.=E2=80=9D This presumption was cherished by a perfidious vizir, who assured his master that, even if the Barbarians had entered the city, the women and children, from the terraces, would be sufficient to overwhelm them with stones. But, when Holagou touched the phantom, it instantly vanished into smoke. After a siege of two months, Bagdad was stormed and sacked by the Moguls; and their savage commander pronounced the death of the caliph Mostasem, the last of the temporal successors of Mahomet; whose noble kinsmen, of the race of Abbas, had reigned in Asia above five hundred years. Whatever might be the designs of the conqueror, the holy cities of Mecca and Medina<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_284" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_284_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">36</a> were protected by the Arabian desert; but the Moguls spread beyond the Tigris and Euphrates, pillaged Aleppo and Damascus, and threatened to join the Franks in the deliverance of Jerusalem.

But it overflowed with resistless violence the kingdoms of Armenia and Anatolia, of which the former was possessed by the Christians, and the latter by the Turks. The sultans of Iconium opposed some resistance to the Mogul arms, till Azzadin sought a refuge among the Greeks of Constantinople, and his feeble successors, the last of the Seljukian dynasty, were finally extirpated by the khans of Persia.</p>

The civil discord of the great dukes or princes of Russia betrayed their country to the Tartars. They spread from Livonia to the Black Sea, and both Moscow and Kiow, the modern and the ancient capitals, were reduced to ashes: a temporary ruin, less fatal than the deep and perhaps indelible mark which a servitude of two hundred years has imprinted on the character of the Russians.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_290" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_290_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">42</a> The Tartars ravaged with equal fury the countries which they hoped to possess and those which they were hastening to leave.

The king, Bela the Fourth, assembled the military force of his counts and bishops; but he had alienated the nation by adopting a vagranthorde of forty thousand families of Comans; and these savage guests were provoked to revolt by the suspicion of treachery and the murder of their prince. The whole country north of the Danube was lost in a day, and depopulated in a summer; and the ruins of cities and churches were overspread with the bones of the natives, who expiated the sins of their Turkish ancestors. An ecclesiastic, who fled from the sack of Waradin, describes the calamities which he had seen or suffered; and the sanguinary rage of sieges and battles is far less atrocious than the treatment of the fugitives, who had been allured from the woods under a promise of peace and pardon, and who were coolly slaughtered as soon as they had performed the labours of the harvest and vintage. In the winter, the Tartars passed the Danube on the ice, and advanced to Gran or Strigonium, a German colony, and the metropolis of the kingdom. Thirty engines were planted against the walls; the ditches were filled with sacks of earth and dead bodies; and, after a promiscuous massacre, three hundred noble matrons were slain in the presence of the khan. Of all the cities and fortresses of Hungary, three alone survived the Tartar invasion, and the unfortunate Bela hid his head among the islands of the Adriatic.</p>

Since the invasion of the Arabs in the eighth century, Europe had never been exposed to a similar calamity; and, if the disciples of Mahomet would have oppressed her religion and liberty, it might be apprehended that the shepherds of Scythia would extinguish her cities, her arts, and all the institutions of civil society. The Roman pontiff attempted to appease and convert these invincible Pagans by a mission of Franciscan and Dominican friars; but he was astonished by the reply of the khan, that the sons of God and of Zingis were invested with a divine power to subdue or extirpate the nations; and that the pope would be involved in the universal destruction, unless he visited in person, and as a suppliant, the royal horde. The emperor Frederic the Second embraced a more generous mode of defence; and his letters to the kings of France and England and the princes of Germany represented the common danger, and urged them to arm their vassals in this just and rational crusade.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_294" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_294_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">46</a> The Tartars themselves were awed by the fame and valour of the Franks; the town <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>149<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> of Neustadt in Austria was bravely defended against them by fifty knights and twenty crossbows; and they raised the siege on the appearance of a German army.

Even the poor and frozen regions of the North attracted the arms of the Moguls: Sheibani Khan, the brother of the great Batou, led an horde of fifteen thousand families into the wilds of Siberia; and his descendants reigned at Tobolskoy above three centuries, till the Russian conquest. The spirit of enterprise which pursued the course of the Oby and Yenisei must have led to the discovery of the Icy Sea. After brushing away the monstrous fables, of men with dogs=E2=80=99 heads and cloven feet, we shall find that, fifteen years after the death of Zingis, the Moguls were informed of the name and manners of the Samoyedes in the neighbourhood of the polar circle, who dwelt in subterraneous huts, and derived their furs and their food from the sole occupation of hunting.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_296" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_296_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">48</a></p>

Like the first caliphs, the first successors of Zingis seldom appeared in person at the head of their victorious armies. On the banks of the Onon and Selinga, the royal or <i>golden horde</i> exhibited the contrast of simplicity and greatness; of the roasted sheep and mare=E2=80=99s milk which composed their banquets; and of a distribution in one day of five hundred waggons of gold and silver. The ambassadors and princes of Europe and Asia were compelled to undertake this distant and laborious pilgrimage; and the life and reign of the great dukes of Russia, the kings of Gregoria and Armenia, the sultans of Iconium, and the emirs of Persia were decided by the frown or smile of the Great Khan. The sons and grandsons of Zingis had been accustomed to the pastoral life; but the village of Caracorum<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_297" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_297_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">49</a> was gradually ennobled by their election and residence. A change of manners is implied in the removal of Octai and Mangou from a tent to an house; and their example was imitated by the princes of their family and the great officers of the empire. Instead of the boundless forest, the enclosure of a park afforded the more indolent pleasures of the chase; their new habitations were decorated with painting and sculpture; their superfluous treasures were cast in fountains, and basons, and statues of massy silver; and the artists of China and Paris vied with each other in the service of the Great Khan.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_298" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_298_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">50</a> Caracorum contained two streets, the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>151<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> one of Chinese mechanics, the other of Mahometan traders; and the places of religious worship, one Nestorian church, two moschs, and twelve temples of various idols, may represent, in some degree, the number and division of inhabitants. Yet a French missionary declares that the town of St. Denys, near Paris, was more considerable than the Tartar capital; and that the whole palace of Mangou was scarcely equal to a tenth part of that Benedictine abbey. The conquests of Russia and Syria might amuse the vanity of the Great Khans; but they were seated on the borders of China; the acquisition of that empire was the nearest and most interesting object; and they might learn from their pastoral economy that it is for the advantage of the shepherd to protect and propagate his flock. I have already celebrated the wisdom and virtue of a mandarin who prevented the desolation of five populous and cultivated provinces. In a spotless administration of thirty years, this friend of his country and of mankind continually laboured to mitigate or suspend the havoc of war; to save the monuments, and to rekindle the flame, of science; to restrain the military commander by the restoration of civil magistrates; and to instil the love of peace and justice into the minds of the Moguls. He struggled with the barbarism of the first conquerors; but his salutary lessons produced a rich harvest in the second generation. The northern and by degrees the southern empire acquiesced in the government of Cublai, the lieutenant and afterwards the successor of Mangou; and the nation was loyal to a prince who had been educated in the manners of China. He restored the forms of her venerable constitution; and the victors submitted to the laws, the fashions, and even the prejudices of the vanquished people. This peaceful triumph, which has been more than once repeated, may be ascribed, in a great measure, to the numbers and servitude of the Chinese. The Mogul army was dissolved in a vast and populous country; and their emperors adopted with pleasure a political system which gives to the prince the solid substance of despotism and leaves <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>152<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> to the subject the empty names of philosophy, freedom, and filial obedience. Under the reign of Cublai, letters and commerce, peace and justice, were restored; the great canal of five hundred miles was opened from Nankin to the capital; he fixed his residence at Pekin,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_299" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_299_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">51</a> and displayed in his court the magnificence of the greatest monarch of Asia. Yet this learned prince declined from the pure and simple religion of his great ancestor; he sacrificed to the idol Fo; and his blind attachment to the lamas of Thibet and the bonzes of China<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_300" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_300_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">52</a> provoked the censure of the disciples of Confucius. His successors polluted the palace with a crowd of eunuchs, physicians, and astrologers, while thirteen millions of their subjects were consumed in the provinces by famine. One hundred and forty years after the death of Zingis, his degenerate race, the dynasty of the Yuen, was expelled by a revolt of the native Chinese;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_301" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_301_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">53</a> and the Mogul emperors were lost in the oblivion of the desert. Before this revolution, they had forfeited their supremacy over the dependent branches of their house, the khans of Kipzak and Russia, the khans of Zagatai or Transoxiana, and the khans of Iran or Persia. By their distance and power, these royal lieutenants had soon been released from the duties of obedience; and, after the death of Cublai, they scorned to accept a sceptre or a title from his unworthy successors. According to their respective situation, they maintained the simplicity of the pastoral life or assumed the luxury of the cities of Asia; but the princes and their hordes were alike disposed for the reception of a foreign worship. After some hesitation between the Gospel and the Koran, they <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>153<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> conformed to the religion of Mahomet; and, while they adopted for their brethren the Arabs and Persians, they renounced all intercourse with the ancient Moguls, the idolaters of China.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_337">In this shipwreck of nations, some surprise may be excited by the escape of the Roman empire, whose relics, at the time of the Mogul invasion, were dismembered by the Greeks and Latins. Less potent than Alexander, they were pressed, like the Macedonian, both in Europe and Asia, by the shepherds of Scythia; and, had the Tartars undertaken the siege, Constantinople must have yielded to the fate of Pekin, Samarcand, and Bagdad. The glorious and voluntary retreat of Batou from the Danube was insulted by the vain triumph of the Franks and Greeks;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_302" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_302_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">54</a> and in a second expedition death surprised him in full march to attack the capital of the C=C3=A6sars. His brother Borga carried the Tartar arms into Bulgaria and Thrace; but he was diverted from the Byzantine war by a visit to Novogorod, in the fifty-seventh degree of latitude, where he numbered the inhabitants and regulated the tributes of Russia. The Mogul khan formed an alliance with the Mamalukes against his brethren of Persia; three hundred thousand horse penetrated through the gates of Derbend; and the Greeks might rejoice in the first example of domestic war.

Their general Noga, whose name is perpetuated in the hordes of Astracan, raised a formidable rebellion against Mengo Timour, the third of the khans of Kipzak; obtained in marriage Maria, the natural daughter of Pal=C3=A6ologus; and guarded the dominions of his friend and father. The subsequent invasions of a Scythian cast were those of outlaws and fugitives; and some thousands of Alani and Comans, who had been driven from their native seats, were reclaimed from a vagrant life and enlisted in the service of the empire. Such was the influence in Europe of the invasion of the Moguls. The first terror of their arms secured rather than disturbed the peace of the Roman Asia. The sultan of Iconium solicited a personal interview with John Vataces; and his artful policy encouraged the Turks to defend their barrier against the common enemy.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_305" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_305_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">57</a> That barrier indeed was soon overthrown; and the servitude and ruin of the Seljukians exposed the nakedness of the Greeks. The formidable Holagou threatened to march to Constantinople at the head of four hundred thousand men; and the groundless panic of the citizens of Nice will present an image of the terror which he had inspired. The accident of a procession, and the sound of a doleful litany, =E2=80=9CFrom the fury of the Tartars, good Lord, deliver us,=E2=80=9D had scattered the hasty report of an assault and massacre. In the blind credulity of fear, the streets of Nice were crowded with thousands of both sexes, who knew not from what or to whom they fled; and some hours elapsed before the firmness of the military officers could relieve the city from this imaginary foe. But the ambition of Holagou and his successors was fortunately diverted by the conquest of Bagdad and a long vicissitude of Syrian wars; their hostility to the Moslems inclined them to unite with the Greeks and Franks;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_306" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_306_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">58</a> and their <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>155<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> generosity or contempt had offered the kingdom of Anatolia as the reward of an Armenian vassal.

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_338">After the retreat of Zingis, the sultan Gelaleddin of Carisme had returned from India to the possession and defence of his Persian kingdoms. In the space of eleven years, that hero fought in person fourteen battles; and such was his activity that he led his cavalry, in seventeen days, from Teflis to Kerman, a march of a thousand miles.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_309" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_309_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">61</a> Yet he was oppressed by the jealousy of the Moslem princes and the innumerable armies of the Moguls; and after his last defeat Gelaleddin perished ignobly in the mountains of Curdistan.

Othman possessed, and perhaps surpassed, the ordinary virtues of a soldier; and the circumstances of time and place were propitious to his independence and success. The Seljukian dynasty was no more; and the distance and decline of the Mogul khans soon enfranchised him from the control of a superior. He was situate on the verge of the Greek empire; the Koran sanctified his <i>gazi</i>, or holy war, against the infidels; and their political errors unlocked the passes of Mount Olympus, and invited him to descend into the plains of Bithynia. Till the reign of Pal=C3=A6ologus, these passes had been vigilantly guarded by the militia of the country, who were repaid by their own safety and an exemption <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>157<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> from taxes. The emperor abolished their privilege and assumed their office; but the tribute was rigorously collected, the custody of the passes was neglected, and the hardy mountaineers degenerated into a trembling crowd of peasants without spirit or discipline. It was on the twenty-seventh of July, in the year twelve hundred and ninety-nine of the Christian era, that Othman first invaded the territory of Nicomedia;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_313" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_313_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">65</a> and the singular accuracy of the date seems to disclose some foresight of the rapid and destructive growth of the monster. The annals of the twenty-seven years of his reign would exhibit a repetition of the same inroads; and his hereditary troops were multiplied in each campaign by the accession of captives and volunteers. Instead of retreating to the hills, he maintained the most useful and defensible posts; fortified the towns and castles which he had first pillaged; and renounced the pastoral life for the baths and palaces of his infant capitals. But it was not till Othman was oppressed by age and infirmities that he received the welcome news of the conquest of Prusa, which had been surrendered by famine or treachery to the arms of his son Orchan. The glory of Othman is chiefly founded on that of his descendants; but the Turks have transcribed or composed a royal testament of his last counsels of justice and moderation.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_314" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_314_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">66</a></p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_339">From the conquest of Prusa we may date the true era of the Ottoman empire. The lives and possessions of the Christian subjects were redeemed by a tribute or ransom of thirty thousand crowns of gold; and the city, by the labours of Orchan, assumed the aspect of a Mahometan capital; Prusa was decorated with a mosch, a college, and an hospital of royal foundation; the Seljukian coin was changed for the name and impression of the new dynasty; and the most skilful professors of human and divine knowledge attracted the Persian and Arabian students from the ancient schools of Oriental learning. The office of vizir was instituted for Aladin, the brother of Orchan; and a different habit distinguished the citizens from the peasants, the Moslems from the infidels. All the troops of Othman had consisted of loose squadrons of Turkman cavalry, who served without pay and fought without discipline; but a regular body of infantry was first established and trained by the prudence of his son.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_315" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_315_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">67</a> <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>159<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> A great number of volunteers was enrolled with a small stipend, but with the permission of living at home, unless they were summoned to the field; their rude manners and seditious temper disposed Orchan to educate his young captives as his soldiers and those of the prophet; but the Turkish peasants were still allowed to mount on horseback and follow his standard, with the appellation and the hopes of <i>freebooters.</i> By these arts he formed an army of twenty-five thousand Moslems; a train of battering engines was framed for the use of sieges; and the first successful experiment was made on the cities of Nice and Nicomedia.

In the defence of his life and honour, Cantacuzene was tempted to prevent or imitate his adversaries by calling to his aid the public enemies of his religion and country. Amir, the son of Aidin, concealed under a Turkish garb the humanity and politeness of a Greek; he was united with the great domestic by mutual esteem and reciprocal services; and their friendship is compared, in the vain rhetoric of the times, to the perfect union of Orestes and Pylades.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_323" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_323_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">75</a> On the report of the danger of his friend, who was persecuted by an ungrateful court, the prince of Ionia assembled at Smyrna a fleet of three hundred vessels, with an army of twenty-nine thousand men; sailed in the depth of winter, and cast anchor at the mouth of the Hebrus. From thence, with a chosen band of two thousand Turks, he marched along the banks of the river, and rescued the empress, who was besieged in Demotica by the wild Bulgarians. At that disastrous moment the life or death of his beloved Cantacuzene was concealed by his flight into Servia; but the grateful Irene, impatient to behold her deliverer, invited him to enter the city, and accompanied her message with a present of rich apparel and an hundred horses. By a peculiar strain of delicacy the gentle Barbarian refused, in the absence of an unfortunate friend, to visit his wife or to taste the luxuries of the palace, sustained in his tent the rigour of the winter; and rejected the hospitable gift, that he might share the hardships <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>163<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> of two thousand companions, all as deserving as himself of that honour and distinction. Necessity and revenge might justify his predatory excursions by sea and land; he left nine thousand five hundred men for the guard of his fleet; and persevered in the fruitless search of Cantacuzene, till his embarkation was hastened by a fictitious letter, the severity of the season, the clamours of his independent troops, and the weight of his spoil and captives. In the prosecution of the civil war, the prince of Ionia twice returned to Europe; joined his arms with those of the emperor; besieged Thessalonica, and threatened Constantinople. Calumny might affix some reproach on his imperfect aid, his hasty departure, and a bribe of ten thousand crowns, which he accepted from the Byzantine court; but his friend was satisfied; and the conduct of Amir is excused by the more sacred duty of defending against the Latins his hereditary dominions. The maritime power of the Turks had united the pope, the king of Cyprus, the republic of Venice, and the order of St. John, in a laudable crusade; their galleys invaded the coast of Ionia; and Amir was slain with an arrow, in the attempt to wrest from the Rhodian knights the citadel of Smyrna.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_324" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_324_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">76</a> Before his death, he generously recommended another ally of his own nation, not more sincere or zealous than himself, but more able to afford a prompt and powerful succour, by his situation along the Propontis and in the front of Constantinople. By the prospect of a more advantageous treaty, the Turkish prince of Bithynia was detached from his engagements with Anne of Savoy; and the pride of Orchan dictated the most solemn protestations that, if he could obtain the daughter of Cantacuzene, he would invariably fulfil the duties of a subject and a son. Parental tenderness was silenced by the voice of ambition; the Greek clergy connived at the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>164<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> marriage of a Christian princess with a sectary of Mahomet; and the father of Theodora describes, with shameful satisfaction, the dishonour of the purple.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_325" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_325_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">77</a> A body of Turkish cavalry attended the ambassadors, who disembarked from thirty vessels before his camp of Selybria. A stately pavilion was erected, in which the empress Irene passed the night with her daughters. In the morning, Theodora ascended a throne, which was surrounded with curtains of silk and gold; the troops were under arms; but the emperor alone was on horseback. At a signal the curtains were suddenly withdrawn, to disclose the bride, or the victim, encircled by kneeling eunuchs and hymen=C3=A6al torches: the sound of flutes and trumpets proclaimed the joyful event; and her pretended happiness was the theme of the nuptial song, which was chaunted by such poets as the age could produce. Without the rites of the church, Theodora was delivered to her Barbarous lord; but it had been stipulated that she should preserve her religion in the harem of Boursa; and her father celebrates her charity and devotion in this ambiguous situation. After his peaceful establishment on the throne of Constantinople, the Greek emperor visited his Turkish ally, who, with four sons, by various wives, expected him at Scutari, on the Asiatic shore. The two princes partook, with seeming cordiality, of the pleasures of the banquet and the chase; and Theodora was permitted to repass the Bosphorus, and to enjoy some days in the society of her mother. But the friendship of Orchan was subservient to his religion and interest; and in the Genoese war he joined without a blush the enemies of Cantacuzene.</p>

A naked crowd of Christians of both sexes and every age, of priests and monks, of matrons and virgins, was exposed in the public market; the whip was frequently used to quicken the charity of redemption; and the indigent Greeks deplored the fate of their brethren, who were led away to the worst evils of temporal and spiritual bondage.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_326" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_326_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">78</a> Cantacuzene was reduced to subscribe the same terms; and their execution must have been still more pernicious to the empire; a body of ten thousand Turks had been detached to the assistance of the empress Anne; but the entire forces of Orchan were exerted in the service of his father. Yet these calamities were of a transient nature; as soon as the storm had passed away, the fugitives might return to their habitations; and at the conclusion of the civil and foreign wars Europe was completely evacuated by the Moslems of Asia. It was in his last quarrel with his pupil that Cantacuzene inflicted the deep and deadly wound, which could never be healed by his successors, and which is poorly expiated by his theological dialogues against the prophet Mahomet. Ignorant of their own history, the modern Turks confound their first and their final passage of the Hellespont,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_327" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_327_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">79</a> and describe the son of Orchan as a nocturnal robber, who, with eighty companions, explores by stratagem an hostile and unknown shore.

In the civil wars of Roumania, he performed some service and perpetrated more mischief; but the Chersonesus was insensibly filled with a Turkish colony; and the Byzantine court solicited in vain the restitution of the fortresses of Thrace. After some artful delays between the Ottoman prince and his son, their ransom was valued at sixty thousand crowns, and the first payment had been made, when an earthquake shook the walls and cities of the provinces; the dismantled places were occupied by the Turks; and Gallipoli, the key of the Hellespont, was rebuilt and repeopled by the policy of Soliman. The abdication of Cantacuzene dissolved the feeble bands of domestic alliance; and his last advice admonished his countrymen to decline a rash contest, and to compare their own weakness with the numbers and valour, the discipline and enthusiasm, of the Moslems. His prudent counsels were despised by the headstrong vanity of youth, and soon justified by the victories of the Ottomans. But, as he practised in the field the exercise of the <i>jerid</i>, Soliman was killed by a fall from his horse; and the aged Orchan wept and expired on the tomb of his valiant son.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_342">But the Greeks had not time to rejoice in the death of their enemies; and the Turkish scymetar was wielded with the same spirit by Amurath the First, the son of Orchan and the brother of Soliman.

Yet the prudence or generosity of Amurath postponed for a while this easy conquest; and his pride was satisfied with the frequent and humble attendance of the emperor John Pal=C3=A6ologus and his four sons, who followed at his summons the court and camp of the Ottoman prince. He marched against the Sclavonian nations between the Danube and the Adriatic, the Bulgarians, Servians, Bosnians, and Albanians; and these warlike tribes, who had so often insulted the majesty of the empire, were repeatedly broken by his destructive inroads. Their countries did not abound either in gold or silver; nor were their rustic hamlets and townships enriched by commerce or decorated by the arts of luxury. But the natives of the soil have been distinguished in every age by their hardiness of mind and body; and they were converted by a prudent institution into the firmest and most faithful supporters of the Ottoman greatness.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_330" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_330_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">82</a> The vizir of Amurath reminded his sovereign that, according to the Mahometan law, he was entitled to a fifth part of the spoil and captives; and that the duty might easily be levied, if vigilant officers were stationed at Gallipoli, to watch the passage, and to select for his use the stoutest and most beautiful of the Christian youth.

The battle of Nicopolis would not have been lost, if the French would have obeyed the prudence of the Hungarians; but it might have been gloriously won, had the Hungarians imitated the valour of the French. They dispersed the first line, consisting of the troops of Asia; forced a rampart of stakes, which had been planted against the cavalry; broke, after a bloody conflict, the Janizaries themselves; and were at length overwhelmed by the numerous squadrons<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_345" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_345_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">97</a> that issued from the woods, and charged on all sides this handful of intrepid warriors.

A knight, whose life had been spared, was permitted to return to Paris, that he might relate the deplorable tale and solicit the ransom of the noble captives. In the meanwhile the count of Nevers, with the princes and barons of France, were dragged along in the marches of the Turkish camp, exposed as a grateful trophy to the Moslems of Europe and Asia, and strictly confined at Boursa, as often as Bajazet resided in his capital. The sultan was pressed each day to expiate with their blood the blood of his martyrs; but he had pronounced that they should live, and either for mercy or destruction his word was irrevocable. He was assured of their value and importance by the return of the messenger, and the gifts and intercessions of the kings of France and of Cyprus. Lusignan presented him with a gold salt-cellar of curious workmanship and of the price of ten thousand ducats; and Charles the Sixth despatched by the way of Hungary a cast of Norwegian hawks, and six horse-loads of scarlet cloth, of fine linen of Rheims, and of Arras tapestry, representing the battles of the great Alexander. After much delay, the effect of distance rather than of art, Bajazet agreed to accept a ransom of two hundred thousand ducats for the count of Nevers and the surviving princes and barons; the marshal Boucicault, a famous warrior, was of the number of the fortunate; but the admiral of France had been slain in the battle; and the constable, with the Sire de Coucy, died in the prison of Boursa. <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>175<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> This heavy demand, which was doubled by incidental costs, fell chiefly on the duke of Burgundy, or rather on his Flemish subjects, who were bound by the feudal laws to contribute for the knighthood and captivity of the eldest son of their lord.

Pal=C3=A6ologus trembled and obeyed; and a cruel precaution involved in the same sentence the childhood and innocence of John, the son of the criminal. But the operation was so mildly, or so unskilfully, performed that the one retained the sight of an eye and the other was afflicted only with the infirmity of squinting. Thus excluded from the succession, the two princes were confined in the tower of Anema; and the piety of Manuel, the second son of the reigning monarch, was rewarded with the gift of the Imperial crown. But at the end of two years the turbulence of the Latins and the levity of the Greeks produced a revolution; and the two emperors were buried in the tower from whence the two prisoners were exalted to the throne. Another period of two years afforded Pal=C3=A6ologus and Manuel the means of escape. It was contrived by the magic or subtlety of a monk, who was alternately named the angel or the devil. They fled to Scutari; their adherents armed in their cause; and the two Byzantine factions displayed the ambition and animosity with which C=C3=A6sar and Pompey had disputed the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>177<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> empire of the world. The Roman world was now contracted to a corner of Thrace, between the Propontis and the Black Sea, about fifty miles in length and thirty in breadth; a space of ground not more extensive than the lesser principalities of Germany or Italy, if the remains of Constantinople had not still represented the wealth and populousness of a kingdom. To restore the public peace, it was found necessary to divide this fragment of the empire; and, while Pal=C3=A6ologus and Manuel were left in possession of the capital, almost all that lay without the walls was ceded to the blind princes, who fixed their residence at Rhodosto and Selybria.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_350" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_350_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">102</a> In the tranquil slumber of royalty, the passions of John Pal=C3=A6ologus survived his reason and his strength; he deprived his favourite and heir of a blooming princess of Trebizond; and, while the feeble emperor laboured to consummate his nuptials, Manuel, with an hundred of the noblest Greeks, was sent on a peremptory summons to the Ottoman <i>porte.</i> They served with honour in the wars of Bajazet; but a plan of fortifying Constantinople excited his jealousy; he threatened their lives; the new works were instantly demolished; and we shall bestow a praise, perhaps above the merit of Pal=C3=A6ologus, if we impute this last humiliation as the cause of his death.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_346">The earliest intelligence of that event was communicated to Manuel, who escaped with speed and secrecy from the palace of Boursa to the Byzantine throne. Bajazet affected a proud indifference at the loss of this valuable pledge; and, while he pursued his conquests in Europe and Asia, he left the emperor to struggle with his blind cousin, John of Selybria, who, in eight years of civil war, asserted his right of primogeniture. At length the ambition of the victorious sultan pointed to the conquest of Constantinople; but he listened to the advice of his vizir, who represented that such an enterprise might unite the powers of Christendom in a second and more formidable <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>178<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> crusade. His epistle to the emperor was conceived in these words: =E2=80=9CBy the divine clemency, our invincible scymetar has reduced to our obedience almost all Asia, with many and large countries in Europe, excepting only the city of Constantinople; for beyond the walls thou hast nothing left. Resign that city; stipulate thy reward; or tremble for thyself and thy unhappy people at the consequences of a rash refusal.=E2=80=9D But his ambassadors were instructed to soften their tone, and to propose a treaty, which was subscribed with submission and gratitude. A truce of ten years was purchased by an annual tribute of thirty thousand crowns of gold; the Greeks deplored the public toleration of the law of Mahomet; and Bajazet enjoyed the glory of establishing a Turkish cadhi and founding a royal mosch in the metropolis of the Eastern church.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_351" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_351_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">103</a> Yet this truce was soon violated by the restless sultan.

His plaintive embassy obtained much pity, and some relief; and the conduct of the succour was entrusted to the marshal Boucicault,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_353" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_353_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">105</a> whose religious chivalry was inflamed by the desire of revenging his captivity on the infidels. He sailed with four ships of war from Aiguesmortes to the Hellespont; forced the passage, which was guarded by seventeen Turkish galleys; landed at Constantinople a supply of six hundred men at arms and sixteen hundred archers; and reviewed them in the adjacent plain, without condescending to number or array the multitude of Greeks. By his presence, the blockade was raised <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>179<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> both by sea and land; the flying squadrons of Bajazet were driven to a more respectful distance; and several castles in Europe and Asia were stormed by the emperor and the marshal, who fought with equal valour by each other=E2=80=99s side. But the Ottomans soon returned with an increase of numbers; and the intrepid Boucicault, after a year=E2=80=99s struggle, resolved to evacuate a country which could no longer afford either pay or provisions for his soldiers. The marshal offered to conduct Manuel to the French court, where he might solicit in person a supply of men and money; and advised in the meanwhile that, to extinguish all domestic discord, he should leave his blind competitor on the throne. The proposal was embraced; the prince of Selybria was introduced to the capital; and such was the public misery that the lot of the exile seemed more fortunate than that of the sovereign. Instead of applauding the success of his vassal, the Turkish sultan claimed the city as his own; and, on the refusal of the emperor John, Constantinople was more closely pressed by the calamities of war and famine. Against such an enemy prayers and resistance were alike unavailing; and the savage would have devoured his prey, if, in the fatal moment, he had not been overthrown by another savage stronger than himself. By the victory of Timour, or Tamerlane, the fall of Constantinople was delayed about fifty years; and this important though accidental service may justly introduce the life and character of the Mogul conqueror.</p>

But his fame shone brighter in adversity; he learned to distinguish the friends of his person, the associates of his fortune, and to apply the various characters of men for their advantage, and above all for his own. On his return to his native country, Timour was successively joined by the parties of his confederates, who anxiously sought him in the desert; nor can I refuse to describe, in his pathetic simplicity, one of their fortunate encounters. He presented himself as a guide to three chiefs, who were at the head of seventy horse. =E2=80=9CWhen their eyes fell upon me,=E2=80=9D says Timour, =E2=80=9Cthey were overwhelmed with joy; and they alighted from their horses; and they came and kneeled; and they kissed my stirrup.

He had done much for his own glory; but much remained to be done, much art to be exerted, and some blood to be spilt, before he could teach his equals to obey him as their master. The birth and power of emir Houssein compelled him to accept a vicious and unworthy colleague, whose sister was the best beloved of his wives. Their union was short and jealous; but the policy of Timour, in their frequent quarrels, exposed his rival to the reproach of injustice and perfidy; and, after a small defeat, Houssein was slain by some sagacious friends, who presumed, for the last time, to disobey the commands of their lord. At the age of thirty-four,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_368" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_368_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">15</a> and in a general diet, or <i>couroultai</i>, he was invested with <i>Imperial</i> command; but he affected to revere the house of Zingis; and, while the emir Timour reigned over Zagatai and the East, a nominal khan served as a private officer in the armies of his servant. A fertile kingdom, five hundred miles in length and in breadth, might have satisfied the ambition of a subject; but Timour aspired to the dominion of the world; and before his death the crown of Zagatai was one of the twenty-seven crowns which he had placed on his head. Without expatiating on the victories of thirty-five campaigns; without describing the lines of march, which he repeatedly traced over the continent of Asia; I shall briefly represent his conquests in I.

No sooner had Timour reunited to the patrimony of Zagatai the dependent countries of Carizme and Candahar, than he turned his eyes towards the kingdoms of Iran or Persia.

Ibrahim, prince of Shirwan or Albania, kissed the footstool of the Imperial throne. His peace-offerings of silks, horses, and jewels were composed, according to the Tartar fashion, each article of nine pieces; but a critical spectator observed that there were only eight slaves. =E2=80=9CI myself am the ninth,=E2=80=9D replied Ibrahim, who was prepared for the remark; and his flattery was rewarded by the smile of Timour.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_371" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_371_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">18</a> Shah Mansour, prince of Fars or the proper Persia, was one of the least powerful, but most dangerous, of his enemies.

Bagdad was no longer the city of peace, the seat of the caliphs; but the noblest conquest of Houlacou could not be overlooked by his ambitious successor. The whole course of the Tigris and Euphrates, from the mouth to the sources of those rivers, was reduced to his obedience. He entered Edessa; and the Turkmans of the black sheep were chastised for the sacrilegious pillage of a caravan of Mecca. In the mountains of Georgia, the native Christians still braved the law and the sword of Mahomet; by three expeditions he obtained the merit of the <i>gazie</i>, or holy war; and the Prince of Teflis became his proselyte and friend.</p>

The dignity of Timour could not endure the impunity of the Getes; he passed the Sihoon, subdued the kingdom of Cashgar, and marched seven times into the heart of their country. His most distant camp was two months=E2=80=99 journey, or four hundred and eighty leagues to the north-east of Samarcand; and his emirs, who traversed the river Irtish, engraved in the forests of Siberia a rude memorial of their exploits. The conquest of Kipzak, or the Western Tartary,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_374" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_374_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">21</a> was founded on the double motive of aiding the distressed <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>188<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> and chastising the ungrateful. Toctamish, a fugitive prince, was entertained and protected in his court; the ambassadors of Auruss Khan were dismissed with an haughty denial, and followed on the same day by the armies of Zagatai; and their success established Toctamish in the Mogul empire of the North. But, after a reign of ten years, the new khan forgot the merits and the strength of his benefactor, the base usurper, as he deemed him, of the sacred rights of the house of Zingis. Through the gates of Derbend, he entered Persia at the head of ninety thousand horse; with the innumerable forces of Kipzak, Bulgaria, Circassia, and Russia, he passed the Sihoon, burnt the palaces of Timour, and compelled him, amidst the winter snows, to contend for Samarcand and his life. After a mild expostulation, and a glorious victory, the emperor resolved on revenge; and by the east and the west of the Caspian and the Volga, he twice invaded Kipzak with such mighty<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_375" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_375_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">22</a> powers that thirteen miles were <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>189<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> measured from his right to his left wing. In a march of five months, they rarely beheld the footsteps of man; and their daily subsistence was often trusted to the fortune of the chase. At length the armies encountered each other; but the treachery of the standard-bearer, who, in the heat of action, reversed the Imperial standard of Kipzak, determined the victory of the Zagatais; and Toctamish (I speak the language of the Institutions) gave the tribe of Toushi to the wind of desolation.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_376" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_376_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">23</a> He fled to the Christian duke of Lithuania; again returned to the banks of the Volga; and, after fifteen battles with a domestic rival, at last perished in the wilds of Siberia.

Moscow trembled at the approach of the Tartar, and the resistance would have been feeble, since the hopes of the Russians were placed in a miraculous image of the Virgin, to whose protection they ascribed the casual and voluntary retreat of the conqueror.

When Timour first proposed to his princes and emirs the invasion of India or Hindostan,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_382" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_382_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">29</a> he was answered by a murmur of discontent: =E2=80=9CThe rivers! and the mountains and <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>191<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> deserts! and the soldiers clad in armour! and the elephants, destroyers of men!=E2=80=9D But the displeasure of the emperor was more dreadful than all these terrors; and his superior reason was convinced that an enterprise of such tremendous aspect was safe and easy in the execution. He was informed by his spies of the weakness and anarchy of Hindostan; the soubahs of the provinces had erected the standard of rebellion; and the perpetual infancy of Sultan Mahmoud was despised even in the harem of Delhi. The Mogul army moved in three great divisions; and Timour observes with pleasure that the ninety-two squadrons of a thousand horse most fortunately corresponded with the ninety-two names or epithets of the prophet Mahomet. Between the Jihoon and the Indus, they crossed one of the ridges of mountains, which are styled by the Arabian geographers the Stony Girdles of the Earth. The highland robbers were subdued or extirpated; but great numbers of men and horses perished in the snow; the emperor himself was let down a precipice on a portable scaffold, the ropes were one hundred and fifty cubits in length; and, before he could reach the bottom, this dangerous operation was five times repeated. Timour crossed the Indus at the ordinary passage of Attok; and successively traversed, in the footsteps of Alexander, the <i>Punjab</i>, or five rivers,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_383" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_383_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">30</a> that fall into the master-stream. From Attok to Delhi the high-road measures no more than six hundred miles; but the two conquerors deviated to the south-east; and the motive of Timour was to join his grandson who had achieved by his command the conquest of Moultan. On the eastern bank of the Hyphasis, on the edge of the desert, the Macedonian hero halted and wept; the Mogul entered the desert, reduced the fortress of Batnir, and stood in arms before the gates of Delhi, a great and flourishing city, which had subsisted three centuries under the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>192<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> dominion of the Mahometan kings. The siege, more especially of the castle, might have been a work of time; but he tempted, by the appearance of weakness, the sultan Mahmoud and his vizir to descend into the plain, with ten thousand cuirassiers, forty thousand of his foot-guards, and one hundred and twenty elephants, whose tusks are said to have been armed with sharp and poisoned daggers. Against these monsters, or rather against the imagination of his troops, he condescended to use some extraordinary precautions of fire and a ditch, of iron spikes and a rampart of bucklers; but the event taught the Moguls to smile at their own fears; and, as soon as these unwieldy animals were routed, the inferior species (the men of India) disappeared from the field. Timour made his triumphal entry into the capital of Hindostan; and admired, with a view to imitate, the architecture of the stately mosch; but the order or licence of a general pillage and massacre polluted the festival of his victory. He resolved to purify his soldiers in the blood of the idolaters, or Gentoos, who still surpass, in the proportion of ten to one, the numbers of the Moslems. In this pious design, he advanced one hundred miles to the north-east of Delhi, passed the Ganges, fought several battles by land and water, and penetrated to the famous rock of Coupele, the statue of the cow, that <i>seems</i> to discharge the mighty river, whose source is far distant among the mountains of Thibet.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_384" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_384_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">31</a> His return was along the skirts of the northern hills; nor could this rapid campaign of one year justify the strange foresight of his emirs that their children in a warm climate would degenerate into a race of Hindoos.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_353">It was on the banks of the Ganges that Timour was informed, by his speedy messengers, of the disturbances which had arisen on the confines of Georgia and Anatolia, of the revolt of the Christians, and the ambitious designs of the sultan Bajazet. His vigour of mind and body was not impaired by sixty-three years and innumerable fatigues; and, after enjoying some tranquil months in the palace of Samarcand, he proclaimed a new expedition of seven years into the western countries of Asia.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_385" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_385_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">32</a> To the soldiers who had served in the Indian war, he granted the choice of remaining at home or following their prince; but the troops of all the provinces and kingdoms of Persia were commanded to assemble at Ispahan and wait the arrival of the Imperial standard. It was first directed against the Christians of Georgia, who were strong only in their rocks, their castles, and the winter-season; but these obstacles were overcome by the zeal and perseverance of Timour; the rebels submitted to the tribute or the Koran; and, if both religions boasted of their martyrs, that name is more justly due to the Christian prisoners, who were offered the choice of abjuration or death. On his descent from the hills, the emperor gave audience to the first ambassadors of Bajazet, and opened the hostile correspondence of complaints and menaces, which fermented two years before the final explosion. Between two jealous and haughty neighbours, the motives of quarrel will seldom be wanting. The Mogul and Ottoman conquests now touched each other in the neighbourhood of Erzeroum and the Euphrates; nor had the doubtful limit been ascertained by time and treaty. Each of these ambitious monarchs might accuse his rival of violating his territory, of threatening his vassals, and protecting his rebels; and, by the name of rebels, each understood the fugitive princes, whose kingdoms he had usurped and whose life or liberty he implacably pursued. The resemblance of character <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>194<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> was still more dangerous than the opposition of interest; and, in their victorious career, Timour was impatient of an equal, and Bajazet was ignorant of a superior.

The true succession of the caliphs was a controversy of a still more delicate nature, and the frankness of a doctor, too honest for his situation, provoked the emperor to exclaim, =E2=80=9CYe are as false as those of Damascus: Moawiyah was an usurper, Yezid a tyrant, and Ali alone is the lawful successor of the prophet.=E2=80=9D A prudent explanation restored his tranquillity; <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>198<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> and he passed to a more familiar topic of conversation. =E2=80=9CWhat is your age?=E2=80=9D said he to the cadhi. =E2=80=9CFifty years.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CIt would be the age of my eldest son. You see me here (continued Timour) a poor, lame, decrepit mortal. Yet by my arm has the Almighty been pleased to subdue the kindgoms of Iran, Touran, and the Indies. I am not a man of blood; and God is my witness that in all my wars I have never been the aggressor, and that my enemies have always been the authors of their own calamity.=E2=80=9D During this peaceful conversation, the streets of Aleppo streamed with blood, and re-echoed with the cries of mothers and children, with the shrieks of violated virgins. The rich plunder that was abandoned to his soldiers might stimulate their avarice; but their cruelty was enforced by the peremptory command of producing an adequate number of heads, which, according to his custom, were curiously piled in columns and pyramids; the Moguls celebrated the feast of victory, while the surviving Moslems passed the night in tears and in chains. I shall not dwell on the march of the destroyer from Aleppo to Damascus, where he was rudely encountered, and almost overthrown, by the armies of Egypt. A retrograde motion was imputed to his distress and despair: one of his nephews deserted to the enemy; and Syria rejoiced in the tale of his defeat, when the sultan was driven, by the revolt of the Mamalukes, to escape with precipitation and shame to his palace of Cairo. Abandoned by their prince, the inhabitants of Damascus still defended their walls; and Timour consented to raise the siege, if they would adorn his retreat with a gift or ransom; each article of nine pieces. But no sooner had he introduced himself into the city, under colour of a truce, than he perfidiously violated the treaty; imposed a contribution of ten millions of gold; and animated his troops to chastise the posterity of those Syrians who had executed or approved the murder of the grandson of Mahomet. A family which had given honourable burial to the head of Hosein, and a colony of artificers whom he sent to labour <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>199<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> at Samarcand, were alone reserved in the general massacre; and, after a period of seven centuries, Damascus was reduced to ashes, because a Tartar was moved by religious zeal to avenge the blood of an Arab.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_395" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_395_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">42</a> The losses and fatigues of the campaign obliged Timour to renounce the conquest of Palestine and Egypt; but in his return to the Euphrates he delivered Aleppo to the flames; and justified his pious motive by the pardon and reward of two thousand sectaries of Ali, who were desirous to visit the tomb of his son. I have expatiated on the personal anecdotes which mark the character of the Mogul hero; but I shall briefly mention<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_396" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_396_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">43</a> that he erected on the ruins of Bagdad a pyramid of ninety thousand heads; again visited Georgia; encamped on the banks of Araxes; and proclaimed his resolution of marching against the Ottoman emperor.

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_355">During this diversion of the Mogul arms, Bajazet had two years to collect his forces for a more serious encounter. They consisted of four hundred thousand horse and foot,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_399" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_399_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">46</a> whose merit and fidelity were of an unequal complexion. We may discriminate the Janizaries, who have been gradually raised to an establishment of forty thousand men; a national cavalry, the Spahis of modern times; twenty thousand cuirassiers of Europe, clad in black and impenetrable armour; the troops of Anatolia, whose princes had taken refuge in the camp of Timour, and a colony of Tartars, whom he had driven from Kipzak, and to whom Bajazet had assigned a settlement in the plains of Hadrianople. The fearless confidence of the sultan urged him to meet his antagonist; and, as if he had chosen that spot for revenge, he displayed his banners near the ruins of the unfortunate Suvas. In the meanwhile, Timour moved from the Araxes through the countries of Armenia and Anatolia: his boldness was secured by the wisest precautions; his speed was guided by order and discipline; and the woods, the mountains, and the rivers were diligently explored by the flying squadrons, who marked his road and preceded his standard. Firm in his plan of fighting in the heart of the Ottoman kingdom, he avoided their camp; dexterously inclined to the left; occupied C=C3=A6sarea; traversed the salt desert and the river Halys; and invested Angora: while the sultan, immoveable and ignorant in his post, compared the Tartar swiftness to the crawling of a snail.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_400" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_400_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">47</a> He returned on the wings of indignation to the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>none<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>201<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> relief of Angora; and, as both generals were alike impatient for action, the plains round that city were the scene of a memorable battle, which has immortalised the glory of Timour and the shame of Bajazet. For this signal victory, the Mogul emperor was indebted to himself, to the genius of the moment, and the discipline of thirty years. He had improved the tactics, without violating the manners, of his nation,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_401" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_401_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">48</a> whose force still consisted in the missile weapons, and rapid evolutions, of a numerous cavalry. From a single troop to a great army, the mode of attack was the same: a foremost line first advanced to the charge, and was supported in a just order by the squadrons of the great vanguard. The general=E2=80=99s eye watched over the field, and at his command the front and rear of the right and left wings successively moved forwards in their several divisions, and in a direct or oblique line; the enemy was pressed by eighteen or twenty attacks; and each attack afforded a chance of victory. If they all proved fruitless or unsuccessful, the occasion was worthy of the emperor himself, who gave the signal of advancing to the standard and main body, which he led in person.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_402" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_402_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">49</a> But in the battle of Angora, the main body itself was supported, on the flanks and in the rear, by the bravest squadrons of the reserve, commanded by the sons and grandsons of Timour. The conqueror of Hindostan ostentatiously shewed a line of elephants, the trophies, rather than the instruments, of victory: the use of the Greek fire was familiar to the Moguls and Ottomans; but, had they borrowed from Europe the recent invention of gunpowder and cannon, the artificial thunder, <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>202<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> in the hands of either nation, must have turned the fortune of the day.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_403" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_403_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">50</a> In that day, Bajazet displayed the qualities of a soldier and a chief; but his genius sunk under a stronger ascendant; and, from various motives, the greatest part of his troops failed him in the decisive moment. His rigour and avarice had provoked a mutiny among the Turks; and even his son Soliman too hastily withdrew from the field. The forces of Anatolia, loyal in their revolt, were drawn away to the banners of their lawful princes. His Tartar allies had been tempted by the letters and emissaries of Timour;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_404" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_404_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">51</a> who reproached their ignoble servitude under the slaves of their fathers, and offered to their hopes the dominion of their new, or the liberty of their ancient, country. In the right wing of Bajazet, the cuirassiers of Europe charged with faithful hearts and irresistible arms; but these men of iron were soon broken by an artful flight and headlong pursuit; and the Janizaries, alone, without cavalry or missile weapons, were encompassed by the circle of the Mogul hunters. Their valour was at length oppressed by heat, thirst, and the weight of numbers; and the unfortunate sultan, afflicted with the gout in his hands and feet, was transported from the field on the fleetest of his horses. He was pursued and taken by the titular khan of Zagatai; and after his capture, and the defeat of the Ottoman powers, the kingdom of Anatolia submitted to the conqueror, who planted his standard at Kiotahia, and dispersed on all sides the ministers of rapine and destruction. Mirza Mehemmed Sultan, the eldest and best beloved of his grandsons, was despatched to Boursa with thirty thousand <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>203<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> horse; and such was his youthful ardour that he arrived with only four thousand at the gates of the capital, after performing in five days a march of two hundred and thirty miles. Yet fear is still more rapid in its course; and Soliman, the son of Bajazet, had already passed over to Europe with the royal treasure. The spoil, however, of the palace and city was immense; the inhabitants had escaped; but the buildings, for the most part of wood, were reduced to ashes. From Boursa, the grandson of Timour advanced to Nice, even yet a fair and flourishing city; and the Mogul squadrons were only stopped by the waves of the Propontis. The same success attended the other mirzas and emirs in their excursions; and Smyrna, defended by the zeal and courage of the Rhodian knights, alone deserved the presence of the emperor himself. After an obstinate defence, the place was taken by storm; all that breathed was put to the sword; and the heads of the Christian heroes were launched from the engines, on board of two carracks, or great ships of Europe, that rode at anchor in the harbour. The Moslems of Asia rejoiced in their deliverance from a dangerous and domestic foe, and a parallel was drawn between the two rivals, by observing that Timour, in fourteen days, had reduced a fortress which had sustained seven years the siege, or at least the blockade, of Bajazet.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_405" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_405_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">52</a></p>

I wished to spare, and even to assist, the champion of the Moslems; you braved our threats; you despised our friendship; you forced us to enter your kingdom with our invincible armies. Behold the event. Had you vanquished, I am not ignorant of the fate which you reserved for myself and my troops. But I disdain to retaliate; your life and honour are secure; and I shall express my gratitude to God by my clemency to man.=E2=80=9D The royal captive shewed some signs of repentance, accepted the humiliation of a robe of honour, and embraced with tears his son Mousa, who, at his request, was sought and found among the captives of the field. The Ottoman princes were lodged in a splendid pavilion; and the respect of the guards could be surpassed only by their vigilance. On the arrival of the harem from Boursa, Timour restored the queen Despina and <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>205<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> her daughter to their father and husband; but he piously required that the Servian princess, who had hitherto been indulged in the profession of Christianity, should embrace without delay the religion of the prophet. In the feast of victory, to which Bajazet was invited, the Mogul emperor placed a crown on his head and a sceptre in his hand, with a solemn assurance of restoring him with an increase of glory to the throne of his ancestors. But the effect of this promise was disappointed by the sultan=E2=80=99s untimely death: amidst the care of the most skilful physicians, he expired of an apoplexy at Akshehr, the Antioch of Pisidia, about nine months after his defeat. The victor dropped a tear over his grave; his body, with royal pomp, was conveyed to the mausoleum which he had erected at Boursa; and his son Mousa, after receiving a rich present of gold and jewels, of horses and arms, was invested by a patent in red ink with the kingdom of Anatolia.</p>

Of his exploits and discipline, Poggius was informed by several ocular witnesses; nor does he forget an example so opposite to his theme as the Ottoman monarch, whom the Scythian confined like a wild beast in an iron cage and exhibited a spectacle to Asia. I might add the authority of two Italian chronicles, perhaps of an earlier date, which would prove at least that the same story, whether false or true, was imported into Europe with <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>207<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> the first tidings of the revolution.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_414" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_414_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">61</a> 3. At the time when Poggius flourished at Rome, Ahmed Ebn Arabshah composed at Damascus the florid and malevolent history of Timour, for which he had collected materials in his journeys over Turkey and Tartary.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_415" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_415_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">62</a> Without any possible correspondence between the Latin and the Arabian writer, they agree in the fact of the iron cage; and their agreement is a striking proof of their common veracity. Ahmed Arabshah likewise relates another outrage, which Bajazet endured, of a more domestic and tender nature. His indiscreet mention of women and divorces was deeply resented by the jealous Tartar. In the feast of victory, the wine was served by female cup-bearers; and the sultan beheld his own concubines and wives confounded among the slaves, and exposed, without a veil, to the eyes of intemperance. To escape a similar indignity, it is said that his successors, except in a single instance, have abstained from legitimate nuptials; and the Ottoman practice and belief, at least in the sixteenth century, is attested by the observing Busbequius,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_416" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_416_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">63</a> ambassador from the court of Vienna to the great Soliman. 4. Such is the separation of language that the testimony of a Greek is not less independent than that of a Latin or an Arab.

Twenty-two years after that event, he was sent ambassador to Amurath the Second; and the historian might converse with some veteran Janizaries, who had been made prisoners with the sultan and had themselves seen him in his iron cage. 5. The last evidence, in every sense, is that of the Turkish annals, which have been consulted or transcribed by Leunclavius, Pocock, and Cantemir.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_418" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_418_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">65</a> They unanimously deplore the captivity of the iron cage; and some credit may be allowed to national historians, who cannot stigmatise the Tartar without uncovering the shame of their king and country.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_358">From these opposite premises, a fair and moderate conclusion may be deduced. I am satisfied that Sherefeddin Ali has faithfully described the first ostentatious interview, in which the conqueror, whose spirits were harmonised by success, affected the character of generosity. But his mind was insensibly alienated by the unseasonable arrogance of Bajazet; the complaints of his enemies, the Anatolian princes, were just and vehement; and Timour betrayed a design of leading his royal captive in triumph to Samarcand. An attempt to facilitate his escape, by digging a mine under the tent, provoked the Mogul emperor to impose a harsher restraint; and, in his perpetual marches, an iron cage on a waggon might be invented, not as a wanton insult, but as a rigorous precaution. Timour had read in some fabulous history a similar treatment of one of his predecessors, a king of Persia; and Bajazet was condemned to represent the person, and expiate the guilt, of the Roman C=C3=A6sar.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_419" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_419_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">66</a> But the strength of his mind and body <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>209<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> fainted under the trial, and his premature death might, without injustice, be ascribed to the severity of Timour. He warred not with the dead; a tear and a sepulchre were all that he could bestow on a captive who was delivered from his power; and, if Mousa, the son of Bajazet, was permitted to reign over the ruins of Boursa, the greatest part of the province of Anatolia had been restored by the conqueror to their lawful sovereigns.</p>

The two passages of the Bosphorus and Hellespont, of Constantinople and Gallipoli, were possessed, the one by the Christians, the other by the Turks. On this great occasion, they forgot the difference of religion, to act with union and firmness in the common cause. The double straits were guarded with ships and fortifications; and they separately withheld the transports which Timour demanded of either nation, under the pretence of attacking their enemy. At the same time, they soothed his pride with tributary gifts and suppliant embassies, and prudently tempted him to retreat with the honours of victory. Soliman, the son of Bajazet, implored his clemency for his father and himself; accepted, by a red patent, the investiture of the kingdom of Romania, which he already held by the sword; and reiterated <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>210<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> his ardent wish of casting himself in person at the feet of the king of the world.

But the fears and fancy of nations ascribed to the ambitious Tamerlane a new design of vast and romantic compass: a design of subduing Egypt and Africa, marching from the Nile to the Atlantic Ocean, entering Europe by the Straits of Gibraltar, and, after imposing his yoke on the kingdoms of Christendom, of returning home by the deserts of Russia and Tartary. This remote and perhaps imaginary danger was averted by the submission of the sultan of Egypt; the honours of the prayer and the coin attested at Cairo the supremacy of Timour; and a rare gift of a <i>giraffe</i>, or camelopard, and nine ostriches represented at Samarcand the tribute of the African world. Our imagination is not less astonished by the portrait of a Mogul, who, in his camp before Smyrna, meditates and almost accomplishes the invasion of the Chinese empire.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_422" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_422_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">69</a> Timour was urged to this enterprise by national honour and religious zeal.

The marriage of six of the emperor=E2=80=99s grandsons was esteemed an act of religion as well as of paternal tenderness; and the pomp of the ancient caliphs was revived in their nuptials. They were celebrated in the gardens of Canighul, decorated with innumerable tents and pavilions, which displayed the luxury of a great city and the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>212<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> spoils of a victorious camp. Whole forests were cut down to supply fuel for the kitchens; the plain was spread with pyramids of meat and vases of every liquor, to which thousands of guests were courteously invited. The orders of the state and the nations of the earth were marshalled at the royal banquet; nor were the ambassadors of Europe (says the haughty Persian) excluded from the feast; since even the <i>casses</i>, the smallest of fish, find their place in the ocean.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_425" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_425_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">72</a> The public joy was testified by illuminations and masquerades; the trades of Samarcand passed in review; and every trade was emulous to execute some quaint device, some marvellous pageant, with the materials of their peculiar art. After the marriage-contracts had been ratified by the cadhis, the bridegrooms and their brides retired to their nuptial chambers; nine times, according to the Asiatic fashion, they were dressed and undressed; and at each change of apparel pearls and rubies were showered on their heads, and contemptuously abandoned to their attendants. A general indulgence was proclaimed; every law was relaxed, every pleasure was allowed; the people was free, the sovereign was idle; and the historian of Timour may remark that, after devoting fifty years to the attainment of empire, the only happy period of his life were the two months in which he ceased to exercise his power. But he was soon awakened to the cares of government and war. The standard was unfurled for the invasion of China: the emirs made their report of two hundred thousand, the select and veteran soldiers of <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>213<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> Iran and Turan; their baggage and provisions were transported by five hundred great waggons, and an immense train of horses and camels; and the troops might prepare for a long absence, since more than six months were employed in the tranquil journey of a caravan from Samarcand to Pekin. Neither age nor the severity of the winter could retard the impatience of Timour; he mounted on horseback, passed the Sihoon on the ice, marched seventy-six parasangs, three hundred miles, from his capital, and pitched his last camp in the neighbourhood of Otrar, where he was expected by the angel of death. Fatigue, and the indiscreet use of iced water, accelerated the progress of his fever; and the conqueror of Asia expired in the seventieth year of his age, thirty-five years after he had ascended the throne of Zagati. His designs were lost; his armies were disbanded; China was saved; and, fourteen years after his decease, the most powerful of his children sent an embassy of friendship and commerce to the court of Pekin.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_426" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_426_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">73</a></p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_361">The fame of Timour has pervaded the East and West; his posterity is still invested with the Imperial <i>title;</i> and the admiration of his subjects, who revered him almost as a deity, may be justified in some degree by the praise or confession of his bitterest enemies.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_427" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_427_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">74</a> Although he was lame of <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>214<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> an hand and foot, his form and stature were not unworthy of his rank; and his vigorous health, so essential to himself and to the world, was corroborated by temperance and exercise. In his familiar discourse he was grave and modest, and, if he was ignorant of the Arabic language, he spoke with fluency and elegance the Persian and Turkish idioms. It was his delight to converse with the learned on topics of history and science; and the amusement of his leisure hours was the game of chess, which he improved or corrupted with new refinements.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_428" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_428_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">75</a> In his religion, he was a zealous, though not perhaps an orthodox, Musulman;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_429" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_429_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">76</a> but his sound understanding may tempt us to believe that a superstitious reverence for omens and prophecies, for saints and astrologers, was only affected as an instrument of policy. In the government of a vast empire, he stood alone and absolute, without a rebel to oppose his power, a favourite to seduce his affections, or a minister to mislead his judgment. It was his firmest maxim that, whatever might be the consequence, the word of the prince should never be disputed or recalled; but his foes <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>215<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> have maliciously observed that the commands of anger and destruction were more strictly executed than those of beneficence and favour. His sons and grandsons, of whom Timour left six-and-thirty at his decease, were his first and most submissive subjects; and, whenever they deviated from their duty, they were corrected, according to the laws of Zingis, with the bastonade, and afterwards restored to honour and command. Perhaps his heart was not devoid of the social virtues; perhaps he was not incapable of loving his friends and pardoning his enemies; but the rules of morality are founded on the public interest; and it may be sufficient to applaud the <i>wisdom</i> of a monarch, for the liberality by which he is not impoverished, and for the justice by which he is strengthened and enriched. To maintain the harmony of authority and obedience, to chastise the proud, to protect the weak, to reward the deserving, to banish vice and idleness from his dominions, to secure the traveller and merchant, to restrain the depredations of the soldier, to cherish the labours of the husbandman, to encourage industry and learning, and, by an equal and modern assessment, to increase the revenue without increasing the taxes, are indeed the duties of a prince; but, in the discharge of these duties, he finds an ample and immediate recompense. Timour might boast that, at his accession to the throne, Asia was the prey of anarchy and rapine, whilst under his prosperous monarchy, a child, fearless and unhurt, might carry a purse of gold from the East to the West. Such was his confidence of merit that from this reformation he derived excuse for his victories and a title to universal dominion. The four following observations will serve to appreciate his claim to the public gratitude; and perhaps we shall conclude that the Mogul emperor was rather the scourge than the benefactor of mankind. 1. If some partial disorders, some local oppressions, were healed by the sword of Timour, the remedy was far more pernicious than the disease. By their rapine, cruelty, and discord, the petty tyrants of Persia might afflict their subjects; but whole <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>216<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> nations were crushed under the footsteps of the reformer. The ground which had been occupied by flourishing cities was often marked by his abominable trophies, by columns or pyramids of human heads. Astracan, Carizme, Delhi, Ispahan, Bagdad, Aleppo, Damascus, Boursa, Smyrna, and a thousand others were sacked, or burnt, or utterly destroyed, in his presence, and by his troops; and perhaps his conscience would have been startled if a priest or philosopher had dared to number the millions of victims whom he had sacrificed to the establishment of peace and order.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_430" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_430_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">77</a> 2. His most destructive wars were rather inroads than conquests. He invaded Turkestan, Kipzak, Russia, Hindostan, Syria, Anatolia, Armenia, and Georgia, without a hope or a desire of preserving those distant provinces. From thence he departed, laden with spoil; but he left behind him neither troops to awe the contumacious, nor magistrates to protect the obedient, natives. When he had broken the fabric of their ancient government, he abandoned them to the evils which his invasion had aggravated or caused; nor were these evils compensated by any present or possible benefits. 3. The kingdoms of Transoxiana and Persia were the proper field which he laboured to cultivate and adorn as the perpetual inheritance of his family. But his peaceful labours were often interrupted, and sometimes blasted, by the absence of the conqueror. While he triumphed on the Volga or the Ganges, his servants, and even his sons, forgot their master and their duty. The public and private injuries were poorly redressed by the tardy rigour of inquiry and punishment; and we must be content to praise the Institutions of Timour, as the specious <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>217<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> idea of a perfect monarchy. 4. Whatsoever might be the blessings of his administration, they evaporated with his life. To reign, rather than to govern, was the ambition of his children and grandchildren,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_431" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_431_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">78</a> the enemies of each other and of the people. A fragment of the empire was upheld with some glory by Sharokh, his youngest son; but after <i>his</i> decease, the scene was again involved in darkness and blood; and before the end of a century Transoxiana and Persia were trampled by the Uzbeks from the North, and the Turkmans of the black and white sheep. The race of Timour would have been extinct, if an hero, his descendant in the fifth degree, had not fled before the Uzbek arms to the conquest of Hindostan. His successors (the Great Moguls<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_432" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_432_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">79</a>) extended their sway from the mountains of Cashmir to Cape Comorin, and from Candahar to the Gulf of Bengal. Since the reign of Aurungzebe, their empire has been dissolved; their treasures of Delhi have been rifled by a Persian robber; and the riches of their kingdoms is now possessed by a company of Christian merchants, of a remote island in the Northern Ocean.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_362">Far different was the fate of the Ottoman monarchy. The massy trunk was bent to the ground, but no sooner did the hurricane pass away than it again rose with fresh vigour and more lively vegetation. When Timour, in every sense, had evacuated Anatolia, he left the cities without a palace, a treasure, or a king. The open country was overspread with hordes of shepherds and robbers of Tartar or Turkman origin; the recent conquests of Bajazet were restored to the emirs, one of whom, in base revenge, demolished his sepulchre; and <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>218<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> his five sons were eager, by civil discord, to consume the remnant of their patrimony. I shall enumerate their names in the order of their age and actions.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_433" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_433_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">80</a> 1. It is doubtful, whether I relate the story of the true <i>Mustapha</i>, or of an impostor who personated that lost prince.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_434" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_434_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">81</a> He fought by his father=E2=80=99s side in the battle of Angora; but, when the captive sultan was permitted to inquire for his children, Mousa alone could be found; and the Turkish historians, the slaves of the triumphant faction, are persuaded that his brother was confounded among the slain. If Mustapha escaped from that disastrous field, he was concealed twelve years from his friends and enemies, till he emerged in Thessaly and was hailed by a numerous party as the son and successor of Bajazet. His first defeat would have been his last, had not the true, or false, Mustapha been saved by the Greeks and restored, after the decease of his brother Mahomet, to liberty and empire. A degenerate mind seemed to argue his spurious birth; and, if, on the throne of Hadrianople, he was adored as the Ottoman sultan, his flight, his fetters, and an ignominious gibbet delivered the impostor to popular contempt. A similar character and claim was asserted by several rival pretenders; thirty persons are said to have suffered under the name of Mustapha; and these frequent executions may perhaps insinuate that the Turkish court was not perfectly secure of the death of the lawful prince. 2. After his father=E2=80=99s captivity, Isa<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_435" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_435_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">82</a> reigned for some time in the neighbourhood of <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>219<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> Angora, Sinope, and the Black Sea; and his ambassadors were dismissed from the presence of Timour with fair promises and honourable gifts. But their master was soon deprived of his province and life by a jealous brother, the sovereign of Amasia; and the final event<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_436" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_436_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">83</a> suggested a pious allusion that the law of Moses and Jesus, of <i>Isa</i> and <i>Mousa</i>, had been abrogated by the greater <i>Mahomet.</i> 3. <i>Soliman</i> is not numbered in the list of the Turkish emperors; yet he checked the victorious progress of the Moguls, and after their departure united for a while the thrones of Hadrianople and Boursa. In war, he was brave, active, and fortunate; his courage was softened by clemency; but it was likewise inflamed by presumption, and corrupted by intemperance and idleness. He relaxed the nerves of discipline in a government where either the subject or the sovereign must continually tremble; his vices alienated the chiefs of the army and the law; and his daily drunkenness, so contemptible in a prince and a man, was doubly odious in a disciple of the prophet. In the slumber of intoxication, he was surprised by his brother Mousa; and, as he fled from Hadrianople towards the Byzantine capital, Soliman was overtaken and slain in a bath, after a reign of seven years and ten months. 4. The investiture of Mousa degraded him as the slave of the Moguls; his tributary kingdom of Anatolia was confined within a narrow limit, nor could his broken militia and empty treasury contend with the hardy and veteran bands of the sovereign of Romania. Mousa fled in disguise from the palace of Boursa; traversed the Propontis in an open boat; wandered over the Walachian and Servian hills; and, after some vain attempts, ascended the throne of Hadrianople, so recently stained with the blood of Soliman. In a reign of three years and a half, his troops were victorious against the Christians of Hungary and the Morea; but Mousa was ruined by his timorous disposition <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>220<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> and unseasonable clemency. After resigning the sovereignty of Anatolia, he fell a victim to the perfidy of his ministers and the superior ascendant of his brother Mahomet. 5. The final victory of Mahomet was the just recompense of his prudence and moderation. Before his father=E2=80=99s captivity, the royal youth had been entrusted with the government of Amasia, thirty days=E2=80=99 journey from Constantinople and the Turkish frontier against the Christians of Trebizond and Georgia. The castle, in Asiatic warfare, was esteemed impregnable; and the city of Amasia,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_437" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_437_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">84</a> which is equally divided by the river Iris, rises on either side in the form of an amphitheatre, and represents, on a smaller scale, the image of Bagdad. In his rapid career, Timour appears to have overlooked this obscure and contumacious angle of Anatolia; and Mahomet, without provoking the conqueror, maintained his silent independence, and chased from the province the last stragglers of the Tartar host. He relieved himself from the dangerous neighbourhood of Isa; but in the contests of their more powerful brethren his firm neutrality was respected; till, after the triumph of Mousa, he stood forth the heir and avenger of the unfortunate Soliman. Mahomet obtained Anatolia by treaty and Romania by arms; and the soldier who presented him with the head of Mousa was rewarded as the benefactor of his king and country. The eight years of his sole and peaceful reign were usefully employed in banishing the vices of civil discord, and restoring, on a firmer basis, the fabric of the Ottoman monarchy.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_438" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_438_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">85</a> His last care was the choice of two vizirs, Bajazet and Ibrahim,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_439" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_439_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">86</a> who might guide the youth of his son Amurath; and such was their <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>221<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> union and prudence that they concealed, above forty days, the emperor=E2=80=99s death, till the arrival of his successor in the palace of Boursa. A new war was kindled in Europe by the prince, or impostor, Mustapha; the first vizir lost his army and his head; but the more fortunate Ibrahim, whose name and family are still revered, extinguished the last pretender to the throne of Bajazet, and closed the scene of domestic hostility.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_363">In these conflicts, the wisest Turks, and indeed the body of the nation, were strongly attached to the unity of the empire; and Romania and Anatolia, so often torn asunder by private ambition, were animated by a strong and invincible tendency of cohesion. Their efforts might have instructed the Christian powers; and, had they occupied, with a confederate fleet, the straits of Gallipoli, the Ottomans, at least in Europe, must have been speedily annihilated. But the schism of the West, and the factions and wars of France and England, diverted the Latins from this generous enterprise; they enjoyed the present respite without a thought of futurity; and were often tempted by a momentary interest to serve the common enemy of their religion.

In the last civil war of the Ottomans, the Genoese governor, Adorno, a bold and ambitious youth, embraced the party of Amurath; and undertook, with seven stout galleys, to transport him from Asia to Europe. The sultan and five hundred guards embarked on board the admiral=E2=80=99s ship, which was manned by eight hundred of the bravest Franks. His life and liberty were in their hands; nor can we, without reluctance, applaud the fidelity of Adorno, who, in the midst of the passage, knelt before him, and gratefully accepted a discharge of his arrears of tribute.

The ambassadors of the son of Bajazet were soon introduced to his presence; but their pride was fallen, their tone was modest; they were awed by the just apprehension lest the Greeks should open to the Moguls the gates of Europe. Soliman saluted the emperor by the name of father; solicited at his hands the government or gift of Romania; and promised to deserve his favour by inviolable friendship, and the restitution of Thessalonica, with the most important places along the Strymon, the Propontis, and the Black Sea. The alliance of Soliman exposed the emperor to the enmity and revenge of Mousa. The Turks appeared in arms before the gates of Constantinople; but they were repulsed by sea and land; and, unless the city was guarded by some foreign mercenaries, the Greeks must have wondered at their own triumph. But, instead of prolonging the division of the Ottoman powers, the policy or passion of Manuel was tempted to assist the most formidable of the sons of Bajazet. He concluded a treaty with Mahomet, whose progress was checked by the insuperable barrier of Gallipoli: the sultan and his troops were transported over the Bosphorus; he was hospitably entertained in the capital; and his successful sally was the first step to the conquest of Romania. The ruin was suspended by the prudence and moderation of the conqueror; he faithfully discharged his own obligations, and those of Soliman; respected the laws of gratitude and peace; and left the emperor guardian of his two younger sons, in the vain hope of saving them from the jealous cruelty of their brother Amurath. But the execution of his last testament would have <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>224<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> offended the national honour and religion; and the divan unanimously pronounced that the royal youths should never be abandoned to the custody and education of a Christian dog. On this refusal, the Byzantine councils were divided; but the age and caution of Manuel yielded to the presumption of his son John; and they unsheathed a dangerous weapon of revenge, by dismissing the true or false Mustapha, who had long been detained as a captive and hostage, and for whose maintenance they received an annual pension of three hundred thousand aspers.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_445" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_445_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">92</a> At the door of his prison, Mustapha subscribed to every proposal; and the keys of Gallipoli, or rather of Europe, were stipulated as the price of his deliverance.

The emperor was at once the enemy of the two rivals; from whom he had sustained, and to whom he had offered, an injury; and the victory of Amurath was followed, in the ensuing spring, by the siege of Constantinople.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_446" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_446_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">93</a></p>

By some shades of wisdom and virtue they may be discriminated from each other; but, except in a single instance, a period of nine reigns and two hundred and sixty-five years is occupied from the elevation of Othman to the death of Soliman, by a rare series of warlike and active princes, who impressed their subjects with obedience and their enemies with terror. Instead of the slothful luxury of the seraglio, the heirs of royalty were educated in the council and the field; from early youth they were entrusted by their fathers with the command of provinces and armies; and this manly institution, which was often productive of civil war, must have essentially contributed to the discipline and vigour of the monarchy. The Ottomans cannot style themselves, like the Arabian caliphs, the descendants or successors of the apostle of God; and the kindred which they claim with the Tartar khans of the house of Zingis appears to be founded in flattery rather than in truth.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_450" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_450_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">97</a> Their origin is obscure; but their sacred and indefeasible right, which no time can erase and no violence can infringe, was soon and unalterably implanted in the minds of their subjects.

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_367">To the spirit and constitution of that nation a strong and singular influence may, however, be ascribed. The primitive subjects of Othman were the four hundred families of wandering Turkmans, who had followed his ancestors from the Oxus to the Sangar; and the plains of Anatolia are still covered with the white and black tents of their rustic brethren. But this original drop was dissolved in the mass of voluntary and vanquished subjects who, under the name of Turks, are united by the common ties of religion, language, and manners. In the cities, from Erzeroum to Belgrade, that national appellation is common to all the Moslems, the first and most honourable inhabitants; but they have abandoned, at least in Romania, the villages and the cultivation of the land to the Christian peasants. In the vigorous age of the Ottoman government, the Turks were themselves excluded from all civil and military honours; and a servile class, an artificial people, was raised by the discipline of education to obey, to conquer, and to command.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_452" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_452_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">99</a> From the time of Orchan and the first Amurath, the sultans were persuaded that a government of the sword must be renewed in each generation with new soldiers; and that such soldiers must be sought, not in effeminate Asia, but among the hardy and warlike natives of Europe. The provinces of Thrace, Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, and Servia became the perpetual seminary of the Turkish army; and, when the royal fifth of the captives was diminished by conquest, an inhuman tax, of the fifth child, or of every fifth year, was rigorously levied on the Christian families.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_453" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_453_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">100</a> At the age of twelve or fourteen <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>228<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> years,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_454" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_454_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">101</a> the most robust youths were torn from their parents; their names were enrolled in a book; and from that moment they were clothed, taught, and maintained for the public service. According to the promise of their appearance, they were selected for the royal schools of Boursa, Pera, and Hadrianople, entrusted to the care of the bashaws, or dispersed in the houses of the Anatolian peasantry. It was the first care of their masters to instruct them in the Turkish language; their bodies were exercised by every labour that could fortify their strength; they learned to wrestle, to leap, to run, to shoot with the bow, and afterwards with the musket; till they were drafted into the chambers and companies of the Janizaries, and severely trained in the military or monastic discipline of the order. The youths most conspicuous for birth, talents, and beauty were admitted into the inferior class of <i>Agiamoglans</i>, or the more liberal rank of <i>Ichoglans</i>, of whom the former were attached to the palace, and the latter to the person of the prince. In four successive schools, under the rod of the white eunuchs, the arts of horsemanship and of darting the javelin were their daily exercise, while those of a more studious cast applied themselves to the study of the Koran and the knowledge of the Arabic and Persian tongues. As they advanced in seniority and merit, they were gradually dismissed to military, civil, and even ecclesiastical employments; the longer their stay, the higher was their expectation; till, at a mature period, they were admitted into the number of the forty agas, who stood before the sultan, and were promoted by his choice to the government of provinces and the first honours of the empire.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_455" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_455_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">102</a> Such a mode of institution was <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>229<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> admirably adapted to the form and spirit of a despotic monarchy. The ministers and generals were, in the strictest sense, the slaves of the emperor, to whose bounty they were indebted for their instruction and support. When they left the seraglio, and suffered their beards to grow as the symbol of enfranchisement, they found themselves in an important office, without faction or friendship, without parents and without heirs, dependent on the hand which had raised them from the dust, and which, on the slightest displeasure, could break in pieces these statues of glass, as they are aptly termed by the Turkish proverb.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_456" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_456_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">103</a> In the slow and painful steps of education, their character and talents were unfolded to a discerning eye: the <i>man</i>, naked and alone, was reduced to the standard of his personal merit; and, if the sovereign had wisdom to choose, he possessed a pure and boundless liberty of choice.

The chymists of China or Europe had found, by casual or elaborate experiments, that a mixture of saltpetre, sulphur, and charcoal produces, with a spark of fire, a tremendous explosion. It was soon observed that, if the expansive force were compressed in a strong tube, a ball of stone or iron might be expelled with irresistible and destructive velocity.

By the Venetians, the use of gunpowder was communicated without reproach to the sultans of Egypt and Persia, their allies against the Ottoman power. The secret was soon propagated to the extremities of Asia; and the advantage of the European was confined to his easy victories over the savages of the new world. If we contrast the rapid progress of this mischievous discovery with the slow and laborious advances of reason, science, and the arts of peace, a philosopher, according to his temper, will laugh or weep at the folly of mankind.</p>

The ways of union are twofold, force and persuasion. Of force, the inefficacy has been already tried; since the Latins have subdued the empire, without subduing the minds, of the Greeks. The method of persuasion, though slow, is sure and permanent. A deputation of thirty or forty of our doctors would probably agree with those of the Vatican, in the love of truth and the unity of belief; but on their return, what would be the use, the recompense, of such agreement? the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>234<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> scorn of their brethren, and the reproaches of a blind and obstinate nation. Yet that nation is accustomed to reverence the general councils which have fixed the articles of our faith; and, if they reprobate the decrees of Lyons, it is because the Eastern churches were neither heard nor represented in that arbitrary meeting. For this salutary end it will be expedient, and even necessary, that a well-chosen legate should be sent into Greece, to convene the patriarchs of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, and, with their aid, to prepare a free and universal synod. But at this moment,=E2=80=9D continued the subtle agent, =E2=80=9Cthe empire is assaulted and endangered by the Turks, who have occupied four of the greatest cities of Anatolia. The Christian inhabitants have expressed a wish of returning to their allegiance and religion; but the forces and revenues of the emperor are insufficient for their deliverance; and the Roman legate must be accompanied, or preceded, by an army of Franks, to expel the infidels and open a way to the holy sepulchre.=E2=80=9D If the suspicious Latins should require some pledge, some previous effect of the sincerity of the Greeks, the answers of Barlaam were perspicuous and rational. =E2=80=9C1. A general synod can alone consummate the union of the churches: nor can such a synod be held till the three Oriental patriarchs, and a great number of bishops, are enfranchised from the Mahometan yoke. 2. The Greeks are alienated by a long series of oppression and injury: they must be reconciled by some act of brotherly love, some effectual succour, which may fortify the authority and arguments of the emperor and the friends of the union. 3. If some difference of faith or ceremonies should be found incurable, the Greeks, however, are the disciples of Christ, and the Turks are the common enemies of the Christian name. The Armenians, Cyprians, and Rhodians are equally attacked; and it will become the piety of the French princes to draw their swords in the general defence of religion. 4.

Two officers of state, with a Latin interpreter, were sent in his name to the Roman court, which was transplanted to Avignon, on the banks of the Rhone, during a period of seventy years; they represented the hard necessity which had urged him to embrace the alliance of the miscreants, and pronounced by his command the specious and edifying sounds of union and crusade.

Under his reign, Avignon was the seat of pomp and pleasure; in his youth he had surpassed the licentiousness of a baron; and the palace, nay, the bedchamber, of the pope was adorned, or polluted, by the visits of his female favourites. The wars of France and England were adverse to the holy enterprise; but his vanity was amused by the splendid idea; and the Greek ambassadors returned with two Latin bishops, the ministers of the pontiff. On their arrival at Constantinople, the emperor and the nuncios admired each other=E2=80=99s piety and eloquence; and their frequent conferences were filled with mutual praises and promises, <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>237<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> by which both parties were amused and neither could be deceived. =E2=80=9CI am delighted,=E2=80=9D said the devout Cantacuzene, =E2=80=9Cwith the project of our holy war, which must redound to my personal glory as well as to the public benefit of Christendom. My dominions will give a free passage to the armies of France: my troops, my galleys, my treasures, shall be consecrated to the common cause; and happy would be my fate, could I deserve and obtain the crown of martyrdom. Words are insufficient to express the ardour with which I sigh for the re-union of the scattered members of Christ. If my death could avail, I would gladly present my sword and my neck; if the spiritual ph=C5=93nix could arise from my ashes, I would erect the pile and kindle the flame with my own hands.=E2=80=9D Yet the Greek emperor presumed to observe that the articles of faith which divided the two churches had been introduced by the pride and precipitation of the Latins: he disclaimed the servile and arbitrary steps of the first Pal=C3=A6ologus; and firmly declared that he would never submit his conscience, unless to the decrees of a free and universal synod. =E2=80=9CThe situation of the times,=E2=80=9D continued he, =E2=80=9Cwill not allow the pope and myself to meet either at Rome or Constantinople; but some maritime city may be chosen on the verge of the two empires, to unite the bishops, and to instruct the faithful, of the East and West.=E2=80=9D The nuncios seemed content with the proposition; and Cantacuzene affects to deplore the failure of his hopes, which were soon overthrown by the death of Clement and the different temper of his successor. His own life was prolonged, but it was prolonged in a cloister; and, except by his prayers, the humble monk was incapable of directing the counsels of his pupil or the state.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_467" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_467_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">7</a></p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_372">Yet, of all the Byzantine princes, that pupil, John Pal=C3=A6ologus, <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>238<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> was the best disposed to embrace, to believe, and to obey the shepherd of the West. His mother, Anne of Savoy, was baptised in the bosom of the Latin church: her marriage with Andronicus imposed a change of name, of apparel, and of worship; but her heart was still faithful to her country and religion; she had formed the infancy of her son, and she governed the emperor, after his mind, or at least his stature, was enlarged to the size of man. In the first year of his deliverance and restoration, the Turks were still masters of the Hellespont; the son of Cantacuzene was in arms at Hadrianople; and Pal=C3=A6ologus could depend neither on himself nor on his people. By his mother=E2=80=99s advice, and in the hope of foreign aid, he abjured the rights both of the church and state; and the act of slavery,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_468" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_468_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">8</a> subscribed in purple ink and sealed with the <i>golden</i> bull, was privately entrusted to an Italian agent. The first article of the treaty is an oath of fidelity and obedience to Innocent the Sixth and his successors, the supreme pontiffs of the Roman and Catholic church. The emperor promises to entertain, with due reverence, their legates and nuncios; to assign a palace for their residence, and a temple for their worship; and to deliver his second son Manuel as the hostage of his faith. For these condescensions, he requires a prompt succour of fifteen galleys, with five hundred men at arms and a thousand archers, to serve against his Christian and Musulman enemies. Pal=C3=A6ologus engages to impose on his clergy and people the same spiritual yoke; but, as the resistance of the Greeks might be justly foreseen, he adopts the two effectual methods of corruption and education. The legate was empowered to distribute the vacant benefices among the ecclesiastics who should subscribe the creed of the Vatican; three schools were instituted to instruct the youth of Constantinople in the language and <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>239<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> doctrine of the Latins; and the name of Andronicus, the heir of the empire, was enrolled as the first student. Should he fail in the measures of persuasion or force, Pal=C3=A6ologus declares himself unworthy to reign; transfers to the pope all regal and paternal authority; and invests Innocent with full power to regulate the family, the government, and the marriage of his son and successor. But this treaty was neither executed nor published. The Roman galleys were as vain and imaginary as the submission of the Greeks; and it was only by the secrecy, that their sovereign escaped the dishonour, of this fruitless humiliation.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_373">The tempest of the Turkish arms soon burst on his head; and, after the loss of Hadrianople and Romania, he was enclosed in his capital, the vassal of the haughty Amurath, with the miserable hope of being the last devoured by the savage. In this abject state, Pal=C3=A6ologus embraced the resolution of embarking for Venice and casting himself at the feet of the pope. He was the first of the Byzantine princes who had ever visited the unknown regions of the West, yet in them alone he could seek consolation or relief; and with less violation of his dignity he might appear in the sacred college than at the Ottoman <i>Porte.</i> After a long absence, the Roman pontiffs were returning from Avignon to the banks of the Tiber; Urban the Fifth,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_469" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_469_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">9</a> of a mild and virtuous character, encouraged or allowed the pilgrimage of the Greek prince; and, within the same year, enjoyed the glory of receiving in the Vatican the two Imperial shadows who represented the majesty of Constantine and Charlemagne. In this suppliant visit, the emperor of Constantinople, whose vanity was lost in his distress, gave more than could be expected of empty sounds and formal submissions. A previous trial was imposed; <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>240<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> and, in the presence of four cardinals, he acknowledged, as a true Catholic, the supremacy of the pope and the double procession of the Holy Ghost. After this purification, he was introduced to a public audience in the church of St. Peter: Urban, in the midst of the cardinals, was seated on his throne; the Greek monarch, after three genuflexions, devoutly kissed the feet, the hands, and at length the mouth of the holy father, who celebrated high mass in his presence, allowed him to lead the bridle of his mule, and treated him with a sumptuous banquet in the Vatican. The entertainment of Pal=C3=A6ologus was friendly and honourable; yet some difference was observed between the emperors of the East and West;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_470" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_470_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">10</a> nor could the former be entitled to the rare privilege of chanting the gospel in the rank of a deacon.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_471" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_471_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">11</a> In favour of his proselyte Urban strove to rekindle the zeal of the French king and the other powers of the West; but he found them cold in the general cause and active only in their domestic quarrels. The last hope of the emperor was in an English mercenary, John Hawkwood,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_472" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_472_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">12</a> or Acuto, who, with a band of adventurers, the White Brotherhood, had ravaged Italy from the Alps to Calabria; sold his services to the hostile states; and incurred a just excommunication by shooting his <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>241<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> arrows against the papal residence. A special licence was granted to negotiate with the outlaw; but the forces, or the spirit, of Hawkwood were unequal to the enterprise; and it was for the advantage perhaps of Pal=C3=A6ologus to be disappointed of a succour that must have been costly, that could not be effectual, and which might have been dangerous.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_473" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_473_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">13</a> The disconsolate Greek<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_474" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_474_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">14</a> prepared for his return, but even his return was impeded by a most ignominious obstacle. On his arrival at Venice, he had borrowed large sums at exorbitant usury; but his coffers were empty, his creditors were impatient, and his person was detained as the best security for the payment. His eldest son Andronicus, the regent of Constantinople, was repeatedly urged to exhaust every resource, and, even by stripping the churches, to extricate his father from captivity and disgrace. But the unnatural youth was insensible of the disgrace, and secretly pleased with the captivity of the emperor; the state was poor, the clergy was obstinate; nor could some religious scruple be wanting to excuse the guilt of his indifference and delay. Such undutiful neglect was severely reproved by the piety of his brother Manuel, who instantly sold or mortgaged all that he possessed, embarked for Venice, relieved his father, and pledged his own freedom to be responsible for the debt. On his return to Constantinople, the parent and king distinguished his two sons with suitable rewards; but the faith and manners of the slothful Pal=C3=A6ologus had not been improved by his Roman pilgrimage; and his apostacy or conversion, <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>242<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> devoid of any spiritual or temporal effects, was speedily forgotten by the Greeks and Latins.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_475" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_475_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">15</a></p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_374">Thirty years after the return of Pal=C3=A6ologus, his son and successor, Manuel, from a similar motive, but on a larger scale, again visited the countries of the West.

The land was occupied by the Turks; but the navigation of Venice was safe and open; Italy received him as the first, or at least as the second, of the Christian princes; Manuel was pitied as the champion and confessor of the faith; and the dignity of his behaviour prevented that pity from sinking into contempt.

At the gates of Paris, he was saluted by the chancellor and the parliament; and Charles the Sixth, attended by his princes and nobles, welcomed his brother with a cordial embrace. The successor of Constantine was clothed in a robe of white silk and mounted on a milkwhite steed =E2=80=94 a circumstance, in the French ceremonial, of singular importance. The white colour is considered as the symbol of sovereignty; and, in a late visit, the German emperor, after an haughty demand and a peevish refusal, had been reduced to content himself with a black courser. Manuel was lodged in the Louvre; a succession of feasts and balls, the pleasures of the banquet and the chase, were ingeniously varied by the politeness of the French, to display their magnificence and amuse his grief. He was indulged in the liberty of his chapel; and the doctors of the Sorbonne were astonished, and possibly scandalised, by the language, the rites, and the vestments of his Greek clergy. But the slightest glance on the state of the kingdom must teach him to despair of any effectual assistance. The unfortunate Charles, though he enjoyed some lucid intervals, continually relapsed into furious or stupid insanity; the reins of government were alternately seized by his brother and uncle, the dukes of Orleans and Burgundy, whose factious competition prepared the miseries of civil war. The former was a gay youth, dissolved in luxury and love; the latter was the father of John, count of Nevers, who had so lately been ransomed from Turkish captivity; and, if the fearless son was ardent to revenge his defeat, the more prudent Burgundy was content with the cost and peril of the first experiment. When Manuel had satiated the curiosity, and perhaps fatigued the patience, of the French, he resolved on a visit to the adjacent island. In his progress from Dover, he was entertained at Canterbury with due reverence by the prior and monks of St. Austin; and, on Blackheath, King Henry the Fourth, with the English <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>244<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> court, saluted the Greek hero (I copy our old historian), who, during many days, was lodged and treated in London as Emperor of the East.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_480" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_480_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">20</a> But the state of England was still more adverse to the design of the holy war. In the same year, the hereditary sovereign had been deposed and murdered; the reigning prince was a successful usurper, whose ambition was punished by jealousy and remorse; nor could Henry of Lancaster withdraw his person or forces from the defence of a throne incessantly shaken by conspiracy and rebellion. He pitied, he praised, he feasted, the emperor of Constantinople; but, if the English monarch assumed the cross, it was only to appease his people, and perhaps his conscience, by the merit or semblance of this pious intention.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_481" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_481_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">21</a> Satisfied, however, with gifts and honours, Manuel returned to Paris; and, after a residence of two years in the West, shaped his course through Germany and Italy, embarked at Venice, and patiently expected, in the Morea, the moment of his ruin or deliverance. Yet he had escaped the ignominious necessity of offering his religion to public or private sale. The Latin church was distracted by the great schism; the kings, the nations, the universities, of Europe were divided in their obedience between the popes of Rome and Avignon; and the emperor, anxious to conciliate the friendship of both parties, abstained from any correspondence with the indigent and unpopular rivals. His journey coincided with the year of the jubilee; but he passed through Italy without desiring or deserving the plenary indulgence which abolished the guilt or penance of the sins <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>245<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> of the faithful.

The greatest part of the country is divided among the princes and prelates; but Strasburg, Cologne, Hamburg, and more than two hundred free cities are governed by sage and equal laws, according to the will, and for the advantage, of the whole community. The use of duels, or single combats on foot, prevails among them in peace and war; their industry excels in all the mechanic arts; and the Germans may boast of the invention of gunpowder and cannon, which is now diffused over the greatest part of the world. II. The kingdom of <span class=3D"csc">France</span> is spread above fifteen or twenty days=E2=80=99 journey from Germany to Spain, and from the Alps to the British Ocean, containing many flourishing cities, and among these Paris, the seat of the king, which surpasses the rest in riches and luxury. Many princes and lords alternately wait in his palace and acknowledge him as their sovereign; the most powerful are the dukes of Bretagne and Burgundy, of whom the latter possesses the wealthy province of Flanders, whose harbours are frequented by the ships and merchants of our own and the more remote seas.

III. Britain, in the ocean and opposite to the shores of Flanders, may be considered either as one or as three islands; but the whole is united by a common interest, by the same manners, and by a similar government. The measure of its circumference is five thousand stadia: the land is overspread with towns and villages; though destitute of wine, and not abounding in fruit-trees, it is fertile in wheat and barley, in honey and wool; and much cloth is manufactured by the inhabitants.

It is situate on the Thames, a broad and rapid river, which, at the distance of thirty miles, falls into the Gallic Sea; and the daily flow and ebb of the tide affords a safe entrance and departure to the vessels of commerce. The king is the head of a powerful and turbulent aristocracy: his principal vassals hold their estates by a free and unalterable tenure; and the laws define the limits of his authority and their obedience. The kingdom has been often afflicted by foreign conquest and domestic sedition; but the natives are bold and hardy, renowned in arms and victorious in war.

Their language bears no affinity to the idioms of the continent; in the habits of domestic life, they are not easily distinguished from their neighbours of France; but the most singular circumstance of their manners is their disregard of conjugal honour and of female chastity.

When Martin the Fifth ascended, without a rival, the chair of St. Peter, a friendly intercourse of letters and embassies was revived between the East and West. Ambition on one side and distress on the other dictated the same decent language of charity and peace. The artful Greek expressed a desire of marrying his six sons to Italian princesses; and the Roman, not less artful, despatched the daughter of the marquis of Montferrat, with a company of noble virgins, to soften, by their charms, the obstinacy of the schismatics. Yet, under this mask of zeal, a discerning eye will perceive that all was hollow and insincere in the court and church of Constantinople. According to the vicissitudes of danger and repose, the emperor advanced or retreated; alternately instructed and disavowed his ministers; and escaped from an importunate pressure by urging the duty of inquiry, the obligation of collecting the sense of his patriarchs and bishops, and <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>250<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> the impossibility of convening them at a time when the Turkish arms were at the gates of his capital. From a review of the public transactions, it will appear that the Greeks insisted on three successive measures, a succour, a council, and a final reunion, while the Latins eluded the second, and only promised the first as a consequential and voluntary reward of the third. But we have an opportunity of unfolding the most secret intentions of Manuel, as he explained them in a private conversation without artifice or disguise. In his declining age the emperor had associated John Pal=C3=A6ologus, the second of the name and the eldest of his sons, on whom he devolved the greatest part of the authority and weight of government.

His daring spirit might have suited the happier times of our ancestors; but the present state requires not an emperor, but a cautious steward of the last relics of our fortunes.

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_377">The eldest of the sons of Manuel, John Pal=C3=A6ologus the Second, was acknowledged, after his father=E2=80=99s death, as the sole emperor of the Greeks. He immediately proceeded to repudiate his wife and to contract a new marriage with the princess of Trebizond; beauty was in his eye the first qualification of an empress; and the clergy had yielded to his firm assurance that, unless he might be indulged in a divorce, he would retire to a cloister and leave the throne to his brother Constantine. The first, and in truth the only, victory of Pal=C3=A6ologus was over a Jew,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_497" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_497_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">37</a> whom, after a long and learned dispute, he converted to the Christian faith; and this momentous conquest is carefully recorded in the history of the times. But he soon resumed the design of uniting the East and West; and, regardless of his father=E2=80=99s advice, listened, as it should seem, with sincerity to the proposal of meeting the pope in a general council beyond the Adriatic. This dangerous project was encouraged by Martin the Fifth, and coldly entertained by his successor Eugenius, till, after a tedious negotiation, the emperor received a summons from a Latin assembly of a new character, the independent prelates of Basil, who styled themselves the representatives and judges of the Catholic church.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_378">The Roman pontiff had fought and conquered in the cause of ecclesiastical freedom; but the victorious clergy were soon exposed to the tyranny of their deliverer; and his sacred character was invulnerable to those arms which they found so keen and effectual against the civil magistrate. Their great charter, the right of election, was annihilated by appeals, evaded by trusts or commendams, disappointed by reversionary <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>253<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> grants, and superseded by previous and arbitrary reservations.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_498" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_498_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">38</a> A public auction was instituted in the court of Rome: the cardinals and favourites were enriched with the spoils of nations; and every country might complain that the most important and valuable benefices were accumulated on the heads of aliens and absentees. During their residence at Avignon, the ambition of the popes subsided in the meaner passions of avarice<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_499" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_499_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">39</a> and luxury: they rigorously imposed on the clergy the tributes of first-fruits and tenths; but they freely tolerated the impunity of vice, disorder, and corruption. These manifold scandals were aggravated by the great schism of the West, which continued above fifty years. In the furious conflicts of Rome and Avignon, the vices of the rivals were mutually exposed; and their precarious situation degraded their authority, relaxed their discipline, and multiplied their wants and exactions. To heal the wounds, and restore the monarchy, of the church, the synods of Pisa and Constance<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_500" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_500_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">40</a> were successively convened; but these great <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>254<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> assemblies, conscious of their strength, resolved to vindicate the privileges of the Christian aristocracy. From a personal sentence against two pontiffs, whom they rejected, and a third, their acknowledged sovereign, whom they deposed, the fathers of Constance proceeded to examine the nature and limits of the Roman supremacy; nor did they separate till they had established the authority, above the pope, of a general council. It was enacted that, for the government and reformation of the church, such assemblies should be held at regular intervals; and that each synod, before its dissolution, should appoint the time and place of the subsequent meeting. By the influence of the court of Rome, the next convocation at Sienna was easily eluded; but the bold and vigorous proceedings of the council of Basil<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_501" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_501_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">41</a> had almost been fatal to the reigning pontiff, Eugenius the Fourth. A just suspicion of his design prompted the fathers to hasten the promulgation of their first decree, that the representatives of the church-militant on earth were invested with a divine and spiritual jurisdiction over all Christians, without excepting the pope; and that a general council could not be dissolved, prorogued, or transferred, unless by their free deliberation and consent. On the notice that Eugenius had fulminated a bull for that purpose, they ventured to summon, to admonish, to threaten, to censure, the contumacious successor of St. Peter. After many delays, to allow time for repentance, they finally declared that, unless he submitted within the term of sixty <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>255<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> days, he was suspended from the exercise of all temporal and ecclesiastical authority. And to mark their jurisdiction over the prince as well as the priest, they assumed the government of Avignon, annulled the alienation of the sacred patrimony, and protected Rome from the imposition of new taxes. Their boldness was justified, not only by the general opinion of the clergy, but by the support and power of the first monarchs of Christendom: the emperor Sigismond declared himself the servant and protector of the synod; Germany and France adhered to their cause; the duke of Milan was the enemy of Eugenius; and he was driven from the Vatican by an insurrection of the Roman people. Rejected at the same time by his temporal and spiritual subjects, submission was his only choice; by a most humiliating bull, the pope repealed his own acts and ratified those of the council; incorporated his legates and cardinals with that venerable body; and <i>seemed</i> to resign himself to the decrees of the supreme legislature. Their fame pervaded the countries of the East; and it was in their presence that Sigismond received the ambassadors of the Turkish sultan,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_502" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_502_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">42</a> who laid at his feet twelve large vases, filled with robes of silk and pieces of gold. The fathers of Basil aspired to the glory of reducing the Greeks, as well as the Bohemians, within the pale of the church; and their deputies invited the emperor and patriarchs of Constantinople to unite with an assembly which possessed the confidence of the Western nations. Pal=C3=A6ologus was not averse to the proposal; and his ambassadors were introduced with due honours into the Catholic senate. But the choice of the place appeared to be an insuperable obstacle, since he refused to pass the Alps or the sea of Sicily, and positively required that the synod should be adjourned to some convenient city in Italy, or at least on the Danube. The other articles of this treaty were more readily stipulated: it was <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>256<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> agreed to defray the travelling expenses of the emperor, with a train of seven hundred persons,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_503" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_503_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">43</a> to remit an immediate sum of eight thousand ducats<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_504" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_504_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">44</a> for the accommodation of the Greek clergy; and in his absence to grant a supply of ten thousand ducats, with three hundred archers, and some galleys for the protection of Constantinople. The city of Avignon advanced the funds for the preliminary expenses; and the embarkation was prepared at Marseilles with some difficulty and delay.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_379">In his distress, the friendship of Pal=C3=A6ologus was disputed by the ecclesiastical powers of the West; but the dexterous activity of a monarch prevailed over the slow debates and inflexible temper of a republic. The decrees of Basil continually tended to circumscribe the despotism of the pope and to erect a supreme and perpetual tribunal in the church. Eugenius was impatient of the yoke; and the union of the Greeks might afford a decent pretence for translating a rebellious synod from the Rhine to the Po. The independence of the fathers was lost if they passed the Alps; Savoy or Avignon, to which they acceded with reluctance, were described at Constantinople as situate far beyond the Pillars of Hercules;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_505" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_505_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">45</a> the emperor and his clergy were apprehensive <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>257<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> of the dangers of a long navigation; they were offended by an haughty declaration that, after suppressing the <i>new</i> heresy of the Bohemians, the council would soon eradicate the <i>old</i> heresy of the Greeks.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_506" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_506_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">46</a> On the side of Eugenius, all was smooth and yielding and respectful; and he invited the Byzantine monarch to heal, by his presence, the schism of the Latin, as well as of the Eastern, church. Ferrara, near the coast of the Adriatic, was proposed for their amicable interview; and with some indulgence of forgery and theft a surreptitious decree was procured, which transferred the synod, with its own consent, to that Italian city. Nine galleys were equipped for this service at Venice and in the isle of Candia; their diligence anticipated the slower vessels of Basil. The Roman admiral was commissioned to burn, sink, and destroy;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_507" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_507_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">47</a> and these priestly squadrons might have encountered each other in the same seas where Athens and Sparta had formerly contended for the pre-eminence of glory. Assaulted by the importunity of the factions, who were ready to fight for the possession of his person, Pal=C3=A6ologus hesitated before he left his palace and country on a perilous experiment. His father=E2=80=99s advice still dwelt on his memory; and reason must suggest that, since the Latins were divided among themselves, they could never unite in a foreign cause. Sigismond dissuaded the unseasonable adventure; his advice was impartial, since he adhered to the council; and it was enforced by the strange belief that the German C=C3=A6sar would nominate <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>258<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> a Greek his heir and successor in the empire of the West.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_508" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_508_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">48</a> Even the Turkish sultan was a counsellor whom it might be unsafe to trust, but whom it was dangerous to offend.

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_381">But, as soon as festivity and form had given place to a more serious treaty, the Greeks were dissatisfied with their journey, with themselves, and with the pope. The artful pencil of his emissaries had painted him in a prosperous state; at the head of the princes and prelates of Europe, obedient, at his voice, to believe and to arm. The thin appearance of the universal synod of Ferrara betrayed his weakness; and the Latins opened the first session with only five archbishops, eighteen bishops, and ten abbots, the greatest part of whom were the subjects or countrymen of the Italian pontiff. Except the duke of Burgundy, none of the potentates of the West condescended to appear in person or by their ambassadors; nor was it possible to suppress the judicial acts of Basil against the dignity and person of Eugenius, which were finally concluded by a new election. Under these circumstances, a truce or delay was asked and granted, till Pal=C3=A6ologus could expect from the consent of the Latins some temporal reward for an unpopular union; and, after the first session, the public proceedings were adjourned <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>263<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> above six months. The emperor, with a chosen band of his favourites and <i>Janizaries</i>, fixed his summer residence at a pleasant spacious monastery, six miles from Ferrara; forgot, in the pleasures of the chase, the distress of the church and state; and persisted in destroying the game, without listening to the just complaints of the marquis or the husbandman.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_520" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_520_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">60</a> In the meanwhile, his unfortunate Greeks were exposed to all the miseries of exile and poverty; for the support of each stranger, a monthly allowance was assigned of three or four gold florins; and, although the entire sum did not amount to seven hundred florins, a long arrear was repeatedly incurred by the indigence or policy of the Roman court.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_521" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_521_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">61</a> They sighed for a speedy deliverance, but their escape was prevented by a triple chain: a passport from their superiors was required at the gates of Ferrara; the government of Venice had engaged to arrest and send back the fugitives; and inevitable punishment awaited them at Constantinople: excommunication, fines, and a sentence which did not respect the sacerdotal dignity, that they should be stripped naked and publicly whipped.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_522" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_522_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">62</a> It was only by the alternative of hunger or dispute that the Greeks could be persuaded to open the first conference; and they yielded with extreme reluctance to <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>264<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> attend, from Ferrara to Florence, the rear of a flying synod.

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_382">Yet all these obstacles were surmounted by time and policy. The violence of the fathers of Basil rather promoted than injured the cause of Eugenius: the nations of Europe abhorred the schism, and disowned the election, of Felix the Fifth, who was successively a duke of Savoy, an hermit, and a pope; and the great princes were gradually reclaimed by his competitor to a favourable neutrality and a firm attachment. The legates, with some respectable members, deserted to the Roman army, which insensibly rose in numbers and reputation: the council of Basil was reduced to thirty-nine bishops and three hundred of the inferior clergy;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_524" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_524_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">64</a> while the Latins of Florence could produce the subscriptions of the pope himself, eight cardinals, two patriarchs, eight archbishops, fifty-two bishops, and forty-five abbots, or chiefs of religious orders. After the labour of nine months, and the debates of twenty-five sessions, they attained the advantage and glory of the reunion of the Greeks. Four principal questions had been agitated between the two churches: 1. The use of unleavened bread in the communion of Christ=E2=80=99s <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>265<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> body; 2. The nature of purgatory; 3. The supremacy of the pope; and 4. The single or double procession of the Holy Ghost. The cause of either nation was managed by ten theological champions: the Latins were supported by the inexhaustible eloquence of Cardinal Julian; and Mark of Ephesus and Bessarion of Nice were the bold and able leaders of the Greek forces. We may bestow some praise on the progress of human reason by observing that the first of these questions was <i>now</i> treated as an immaterial rite, which might innocently vary with the fashion of the age and country. With regard to the second, both parties were agreed in the belief of an intermediate state of purgation for the venal sins of the faithful; and, whether their souls were purified by elemental fire was a doubtful point, which in a few years might be conveniently settled on the spot by the disputants. The claims of supremacy appeared of a more weighty and substantial kind; yet, by the Orientals, the Roman bishop had ever been respected as the first of the five patriarchs; nor did they scruple to admit that his jurisdiction should be exercised agreeable to the holy canons: a vague allowance which might be defined or eluded by occasional convenience. The procession of the Holy Ghost from the Father alone, or from the Father and the Son, was an article of faith which had sunk much deeper into the minds of men; and in the sessions of Ferrara and Florence the Latin addition of <i>filioque</i> was subdivided into two questions, whether it were legal, and whether it were orthodox. Perhaps it may not be necessary to boast on this subject of my own impartial indifference; but I must think that the Greeks were strongly supported by the prohibition of the council of Chalcedon against adding any article whatsoever to the creed of Nice or rather of Constantinople.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_525" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_525_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">65</a> In earthly affairs, it is not easy to <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>266<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> conceive how an assembly of legislators can bind their successors invested with powers equal to their own. But the dictates of inspiration must be true and unchangeable; nor should a private bishop, or a provincial synod, have presumed to innovate against the judgment of the Catholic church. On the substance of the doctrine, the controversy was equal and endless: reason is confounded by the procession of a deity; the gospel, which lay on the altar, was silent; the various texts of the fathers might be corrupted by fraud or entangled by sophistry; and the Greeks were ignorant of the characters and writings of the Latin saints.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_526" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_526_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">66</a> Of this, at least, we way be sure, that neither side could be convinced by the arguments of their opponents.

But the bishops and monks had been taught from their infancy to repeat a form of mysterious words; their national and personal honour depended on the repetition of the same sounds; and their narrow minds were hardened and inflamed by the acrimony of a public dispute.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_383">While they were lost in a cloud of dust and darkness, the pope and emperor were desirous of a seeming union, which could alone accomplish the purposes of their interview; and the obstinacy of public dispute was softened by the arts of private and personal negotiation. The patriarch Joseph had sunk under the weight of age and infirmities; his dying voice breathed the counsels of charity and concord, and his vacant benefice might tempt the hopes of the ambitious clergy. The ready and active obedience of the archbishops of Russia and Nice, of Isidore and Bessarion, was prompted and recompensed by their speedy promotion to the dignity of cardinals. Bessarion, in the first debates, had stood forth the most <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>267<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> strenuous and eloquent champion of the Greek church; and, if the apostate, the bastard, was reprobated by his country,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_527" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_527_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">67</a> he appears in ecclesiastical story a rare example of a patriot who was recommended to court favour by loud opposition and well-timed compliance. With the aid of his two spiritual coadjutors, the emperor applied his arguments to the general situation and personal characters of the bishops, and each was successively moved by authority and example.

Demetrius, the emperor=E2=80=99s brother, retired to Venice, that he might not be witness of the union; and Mark of Ephesus, mistaking perhaps his pride for his conscience, disclaimed all communion with the Latin heretics, and avowed himself the champion and confessor of the orthodox creed.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_531" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_531_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">71</a> In the treaty between the two nations several forms of consent were proposed, such as might satisfy the Latins without dishonouring the Greeks; and they weighed the scruples of words and syllables, till the theological balance trembled with a slight preponderance in favour of the Vatican.

It is less difficult to understand the articles of the preliminary treaty: that the pope should defray all the expenses of the Greeks in their return home; that he should annually maintain two galleys and three hundred soldiers for the defence of Constantinople; that all the ships which transported pilgrims to Jerusalem <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>269<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> should be obliged to touch at that port; that, as often as they were required, the pope should furnish ten galleys for a year, or twenty-six months; and that he should powerfully solicit the princes of Europe, if the emperor had occasion for landforces.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_384">The same year, and almost the same day, were marked by the deposition of Eugenius at Basil, and, at Florence, by his reunion of the Greeks and Latins.

The ecclesiastics presided over the education of youth; the schools of philosophy and eloquence were perpetuated till the fall of the empire; and it may be affirmed that more books and more knowledge were included within the walls of Constantinople than could be dispersed over the extensive countries of the West.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_545" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_545_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">85</a> But an important distinction has been already noticed: the Greeks were stationary or retrograde, while the Latins were advancing with a rapid and progressive motion. The nations were excited by the spirit of independence and emulation; and even the little world of the Italian states contained more people and industry than the decreasing circle of the Byzantine empire. In Europe, the lower ranks of society were relieved from the yoke of feudal servitude; and freedom is the first step to curiosity and knowledge. The use, however rude and corrupt, of the Latin tongue had been preserved by supersition; the universities, from Bologna to Oxford,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_546" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_546_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">86</a> were peopled with thousands <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>275<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> of scholars; and their misguided ardour might be directed to more liberal and manly studies. In the resurrection of science, Italy was the first that cast away her shroud; and the eloquent Petrarch, by his lessons and his example, may justly be applauded as the first harbinger of day. A purer style of composition, a more generous and rational strain of sentiment, flowed from the study and imitation of the writers of ancient Rome; and the disciples of Cicero and Virgil approached, with reverence and love, the sanctuary of their Grecian masters. In the sack of Constantinople, the French, and even the Venetians, had despised and destroyed the works of Lysippus and Homer; the monuments of art may be annihilated by a single blow; but the immortal mind is renewed and multiplied by the copies of the pen; and such copies it was the ambition of Petrarch and his friends to possess and understand. The arms of the Turks undoubtedly pressed the flight of the Muses; yet we may tremble at the thought that Greece might have been overwhelmed, with her schools and libraries, before Europe had emerged from the deluge of Barbarism; that the seeds of science might have been scattered by the winds, before the Italian soil was prepared for their cultivation.</p>

Without scrutinising the merit of individuals, truth must observe that their science is without a cause and without an effect; that it was easy for them to satisfy themselves and their more ignorant contemporaries; and that the idiom, which they had so marvellously acquired, was transcribed in few manuscripts, and was not taught in any university of the West. In a corner of Italy it faintly existed as the popular, or at least as the ecclesiastical, dialect.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_548" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_548_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">88</a> The first impression of the Doric and Ionic colonies has never been completely erased; the Calabrian churches were long attached to the throne of Constantinople; and the monks of St. Basil pursued their studies in Mount Athos and the schools of the East.

One of these attestations is still extant; and the emperor Cantacuzene, the protector of his adversaries, is forced to allow that Euclid, Aristotle, and Plato were familiar to that profound and subtle logician.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_551" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_551_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">91</a> In the court of Avignon, he formed an intimate connection with Petrarch,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_552" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_552_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">92</a> the first of the Latin scholars; and the desire of mutual instruction was the principle of their literary commerce. The Tuscan applied himself with eager curiosity and assiduous diligence to the study of the Greek language; and, in a laborious struggle with the dryness and difficulty of the first rudiments, he began to reach the sense, and to feel the spirit, of poets and philosophers whose minds were congenial to his own. But he was soon deprived of the society and lessons of this useful assistant. Barlaam relinquished his fruitless embassy; and, on his return to Greece, he rashly provoked the swarms of fanatic monks by attempting to substitute the light of reason to that of their navel. After a separation of three years, the two friends again met in the court of Naples; but the generous pupil renounced the fairest occasion of improvement; and by his recommendation Barlaam <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>278<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> was finally settled in a small bishopric of his native Calabria.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_553" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_553_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">93</a> The manifold avocations of Petrarch, love and friendship, his various correspondence and frequent journeys, the Roman laurel, and his elaborate compositions in prose and verse, in Latin and Italian, diverted him from a foreign idiom; and, as he advanced in life, the attainment of the Greek language was the object of his wishes rather than of his hopes. When he was about fifty years of age, a Byzantine ambassador, his friend, and a master of both tongues, presented him with a copy of Homer; and the answer of Petrarch is at once expressive of his eloquence, gratitude, and regret. After celebrating the generosity of the donor, and the value of a gift more precious in his estimation than gold or rubies, he thus proceeds: =E2=80=9CYour present of the genuine and original text of the divine poet, the fountain of all invention, is worthy of yourself and of me; you have fulfilled your promise and satisfied my desires. Yet your liberality is still imperfect: with Homer you should have given me yourself: a guide, who could lead me into the fields of light, and disclose to my wondering eyes the specious miracles of the Iliad and Odyssey. But, alas! Homer is dumb, or I am deaf; nor is it in my power to enjoy the beauty which I possess. I have seated him by the side of Plato, the prince of poets near the prince of philosophers; and I glory in the sight of my illustrious guests. Of their immortal writings, whatever had been translated into the Latin idiom, I had already acquired; but, if there be no profit, there is some pleasure in beholding these venerable Greeks in their proper and national habit. I am delighted with the aspect of Homer; and, as often as I embrace the silent volume, I exclaim, with a sigh, Illustrious bard! with what pleasure should I listen to thy song, if my sense of hearing were not obstructed and lost <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>279<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> by the death of one friend, and in the much lamented absence of another! Nor do I yet despair; and the example of Cato suggests some comfort and hope, since it was in the last period of age that he attained the knowledge of the Greek letters.=E2=80=9D<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_554" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_554_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">94</a></p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_388">The prize which eluded the efforts of Petrarch was obtained by the fortune and industry of his friend Boccace,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_555" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_555_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">95</a> the father of the Tuscan prose. That popular writer, who derives his reputation from the Decameron, an hundred novels of pleasantry and love, may aspire to the more serious praise of restoring in Italy the study of the Greek language. In the year one thousand three hundred and sixty, a disciple of Barlaam, whose name was Leo or Leontius Pilatus, was detained in his way to Avignon by the advice and hospitality of Boccace, who lodged the stranger in his house, prevailed on the republic of Florence to allow him an annual stipend, and devoted his leisure to the first Greek professor who taught the language in the Western countries of Europe. The appearance of Leo might disgust the most eager disciple: he was clothed in the mantle of a philosopher, or a mendicant; his countenance was hideous; his face was overshadowed with black hair; his beard long and uncombed; his deportment rustic; his temper gloomy and inconstant; nor could he grace his discourse with the ornaments or even the perspicuity of Latin elocution. But his mind was stored with a treasure of Greek learning; history and fable, philosophy and grammar, were alike at his <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>280<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> command; and he read the poems of Homer in the schools of Florence. It was from his explanation that Boccace composed and transcribed a literal prose version of the Iliad and Odyssey, which satisfied the thirst of his friend Petrarch, and which perhaps, in the succeeding century, was clandestinely used by Laurentius Valla, the Latin interpreter. It was from his narratives that the same Boccace collected the materials for his treatise on the genealogy of the heathen gods; a work, in that age, of stupendous erudition, and which he ostentatiously sprinkled with Greek characters and passages, to excite the wonder and applause of his more ignorant readers.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_556" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_556_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">96</a> The first steps of learning are slow and laborious: no more than ten votaries of Homer could be enumerated in all Italy; and neither Rome nor Venice nor Naples could add a single name to this studious catalogue. But their numbers would have multiplied, their progress would have been accelerated, if the inconstant Leo, at the end of three years, had not relinquished an honourable and beneficial station. In his passage, Petrarch entertained him at Padua a short time: he enjoyed the scholar, but was justly offended with the gloomy and unsocial temper of the man. Discontented with the world and with himself, Leo depreciated his present enjoyments, while absent persons and objects were dear to his imagination. In Italy, he was a Thessalian, in Greece, a native of Calabria; in the company of the Latins, he disdained their language, religion, and manner: no sooner was he landed at Constantinople, than he again sighed for the wealth of Venice and the elegance of Florence. His Italian friends were deaf to his importunity; he depended on their curiosity and indulgence, and embarked on a second voyage; but, on his entrance into the Adriatic, the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>281<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> ship was assailed by a tempest, and the unfortunate teacher, who, like Ulysses, had fastened himself to the mast, was struck dead by a flash of lightning. The humane Petrarch dropped a tear on his disaster; but he was most anxious to learn whether some copy of Euripides or Sophocles might not be saved from the hands of the mariners.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_557" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_557_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">97</a></p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_389">But the faint rudiments of Greek learning, which Petrarch had encouraged and Boccace had planted, soon withered and expired. The succeeding generation was content for a while with the improvement of Latin eloquence; nor was it before the end of the fourteenth century that a new and perpetual flame was rekindled in Italy.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_558" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_558_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">98</a> Previous to his own journey, the emperor Manuel despatched his envoys and orators to implore the compassion of the Western princes. Of these envoys, the most conspicuous or the most learned was Manuel Chrysoloras,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_559" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_559_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">99</a> of noble birth, and whose Roman ancestors are supposed to have migrated with the great Constantine. After visiting the courts of France and England, where he obtained some contributions and more promises, the envoy was invited to assume the office of a professor; and Florence had again the honour of this second invitation. By his knowledge, not only of the Greek but of the Latin tongue, Chrysoloras deserved the stipend and surpassed the expectation of the republic; <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>282<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> his school was frequented by a crowd of disciples of every rank and age; and one of these, in a general history, has described his motives and his success. =E2=80=9CAt that time,=E2=80=9D says Leonard Aretin,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_560" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_560_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">100</a> =E2=80=9CI was a student of the civil law; but my soul was inflamed with the love of letters; and I bestowed some application on the sciences of logic and rhetoric. On the arrival of Manuel, I hesitated whether I should desert my legal studies or relinquish this golden opportunity; and thus, in the ardour of youth, I communed with my own mind =E2=80=94 Wilt thou be wanting to thyself and thy fortune? Wilt thou refuse to be introduced to a familiar converse with Homer, Plato, and Demosthenes? with those poets, philosophers, and orators, of whom such wonders are related, and who are celebrated by every age as the great masters of human science? Of professors and scholars in civil law, a sufficient supply will always be found in our universities; but a teacher, and such a teacher, of the Greek language, if he once be suffered to escape, may never afterwards be retrieved. Convinced by these reasons, I gave myself to Chrysoloras; and so strong was my passion that the lessons which I had imbibed in the day were the constant subject of my nightly dreams.=E2=80=9D<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_561" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_561_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">101</a> At the same time and place the Latin classics were explained by John of Ravenna, the domestic pupil of Petrarch;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_562" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_562_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">102</a> the Italians, who illustrated their age and country, were formed in this double school; and Florence became the fruitful <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>283<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> seminary of Greek and Roman erudition.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_563" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_563_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">103</a> The presence of the emperor recalled Chrysoloras from the college to the court, but he afterwards taught at Pavia and Rome with equal industry and applause. The remainder of his life, about fifteen years, was divided between Italy and Constantinople, between embassies and lessons. In the noble office of enlightening a foreign nation, the grammarian was not unmindful of a more sacred duty to his prince and country; and Emanuel Chrysoloras died at Constance, on a public mission from the emperor to the council.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_390">After his example, the restoration of the Greek letters in Italy was prosecuted by a series of emigrants, who were destitute of fortune, and endowed with learning, or at least with language. From the terror or oppression of the Turkish arms the natives of Thessalonica and Constantinople escaped to a land of freedom, curiosity, and wealth. The synod introduced into Florence the lights of the Greek church and the oracles of the Platonic philosophy; and the fugitives who adhered to the union had the double merit of renouncing their country not only for the Christian but for the Catholic cause. A patriot who sacrifices his party and conscience to the allurements of favour may be possessed, however, of the private and social virtues; he no longer hears the reproachful epithets of slave and apostate; and the consideration which he acquires among his new associates will restore in his own eyes the dignity of his character. The prudent conformity of Bessarion was rewarded with the Roman purple; he fixed his residence in Italy; and the Greek cardinal, the titular <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>284<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> patriarch of Constantinople, was respected as the chief and protector of his nation.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_564" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_564_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">104</a> His abilities were exercised in the legations of Bologna, Venice, Germany, and France; and his election to the chair of St. Peter floated for a moment on the uncertain breath of a conclave.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_565" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_565_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">105</a> His ecclesiastical honours diffused a splendour and pre-eminence over his literary merit and service: his palace was a school; as often as the cardinal visited the Vatican, he was attended by a learned train of both nations;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_566" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_566_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">106</a> of men applauded by themselves and the public; and whose writings, now overspread with dust, were popular and useful in their own times. I shall not attempt to enumerate the restorers of Grecian literature in the fifteenth century; and it may be sufficient to mention with gratitude the names of Theodore Gaza, of George of Trebizond, of John Argyropulus, and Demetrius Chalcondyles, who taught their native language in the schools of Florence and Rome. Their labours were not inferior to those of Bessarion, whose purple they revered, and whose fortune was the secret object of their envy. But the lives of these grammarians were humble and obscure; they had declined the lucrative paths of the church; their dress and manners secluded them from the commerce of the world; and, since they were confined to the merit, they might be content with the rewards, of learning. From this character Janus Lascaris<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_567" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_567_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">107</a> <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>285<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> will deserve an exception. His eloquence, politeness, and Imperial descent recommended him to the French monarchs; and in the same cities he was alternately employed to teach and to negotiate. Duty and interest prompted them to cultivate the study of the Latin language; and the most successful attained the faculty of writing and speaking with fluency and elegance in a foreign idiom. But they ever retained the inveterate vanity of their country: their praise, or at least their esteem, was reserved for the national writers, to whom they owed their fame and subsistence; and they sometimes betrayed their contempt in licentious criticism or satire on Virgil=E2=80=99s poetry and the oratory of Tully.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_568" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_568_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">108</a> The superiority of these masters arose from the familiar use of a living language; and their first disciples were incapable of discerning how far they had degenerated from the knowledge, and even the practice, of their ancestors.

Of the power of the Greek accents they were ignorant; and those musical notes, which, from an Attic tongue and to an Attic ear, must have been the secret soul of harmony, were to their eyes, as to our own, no more than mute or unmeaning marks, in prose superfluous and troublesome in verse.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_570" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_570_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">109a</a> The art of grammar they truly possessed; the valuable fragments of Apollonius and Herodian were transfused into their lessons; and their treatises of syntax and etymology, though devoid of philosophic spirit, are still useful to the Greek student. In the shipwreck of the Byzantine libraries, each fugitive seized a fragment of treasure, a copy of some author, who, without his industry, might have perished; the transcripts were multiplied by an assiduous, and sometimes an elegant, pen; and the text was corrected and explained by their own comments or those of the elder scholiasts. The sense, though not the spirit, of the Greek classics was interpreted to the Latin world; the beauties of style evaporate in a version; but the judgment of Theodore Gaza selected the more solid works of Aristotle and Theophrastus, and their natural histories of animals and plants opened a rich fund of genuine and experimental science.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_571" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_571_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">110</a></p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_391">Yet the fleeting shadows of metaphysics were pursued with more curiosity and ardour. After a long oblivion, Plato was revived in Italy by a venerable Greek,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_572" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_572_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">111</a> who taught in the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>287<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> house of Cosmo of Medicis. While the synod of Florence was involved in theological debate, some beneficial consequences might flow from the study of his elegant philosophy; his style is the purest standard of the Attic dialect; and his sublime thoughts are sometimes adapted to familiar conversation, and sometimes adorned with the richest colours of poetry and eloquence. The dialogues of Plato are a dramatic picture of the life and death of a sage; and, as often as he descends from the clouds, his moral system inculcates the love of truth, of our country, and of mankind. The precept and example of Socrates recommended a modest doubt and liberal inquiry; and, if the Platonists, with blind devotion, adored the visions and errors of their divine master, their enthusiasm might correct the dry dogmatic method of the Peripatetic school. So equal, yet so opposite, are the merits of Plato and Aristotle that they may be balanced in endless controversy; but some spark of freedom may be produced by the collision of adverse servitude. The modern Greeks were divided between the two sects; with more fury than skill they fought under the banner of their leaders; and the field of battle was removed in their flight from Constantinople to Rome. But this philosophic debate soon degenerated into an angry and personal quarrel of grammarians; and Bessarion, though an advocate for Plato, protected the national honour, by interposing the advice and authority of a mediator. In the gardens of the Medici, the academical doctrine was enjoyed by the polite and <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>288<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> learned; but their philosophic society was quickly dissolved; and, if the writings of the Attic sage were perused in the closet, the more powerful Stagirite continued to reign the oracle of the church and school.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_573" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_573_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">112</a></p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_392">I have fairly represented the literary merits of the Greeks; yet it must be confessed that they were seconded and surpassed by the ardour of the Latins.

The Vatican, the old repository for bulls and legends, for superstition and forgery, was daily replenished with more precious furniture; and such was the industry of Nicholas that in a reign of eight years he formed a library of five thousand volumes. To his munificence the Latin world was indebted for the versions of Xenophon, Diodorus, Polybius, Thucydides, Herodotus, and Appian; of Strabo=E2=80=99s Geography, of the Iliad, of the most valuable works of Plato and Aristotle, of Ptolemy and Theophrastus, and of the fathers of the Greek church.

The genius and education of his grandson Lorenzo rendered him, not only a patron, but a judge and candidate, in the literary race. In his palace, distress was entitled to relief, and merit to reward; his leisure-hours were delightfully spent in the Platonic academy; he encouraged the emulation of Demetrius Chalcondyles and Angelo Politian; and his active missionary, Janus Lascaris, returned from the East with a treasure of two hundred manuscripts, fourscore of which were as yet unknown in the libraries of Europe.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_577" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_577_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">116</a> The rest of <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>290<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> Italy was animated by a similar spirit, and the progress of the nation repaid the liberality of her princes.

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_393">Before the revival of classic literature, the Barbarians in Europe were immersed in ignorance; and their vulgar tongues were marked with the rudeness and poverty of their manners. The students of the more perfect idioms of Rome and Greece were introduced to a new world of light and science; to the society of the free and polished nations of antiquity; and to a familiar converse with those immortal men who spoke the sublime language of eloquence and reason. Such an intercourse must tend to refine the taste, and to elevate the genius, of the moderns; and yet, from the first experiments, it might appear that the study of the ancients had given fetters, rather than wings, to the human mind. However laudable, the spirit of imitation is of a servile cast; and the first disciples of the Greeks and Romans were a colony of strangers in the midst of their age and country. The minute and laborious diligence which explored the antiquities of remote times might have improved or adorned the present state of society: the critic and metaphysician were the slaves of Aristotle; the poets, historians, and orators were proud to repeat the thoughts and words of the Augustan age; the works of nature were observed with the eyes of Pliny and Theophrastus; and some pagan votaries professed a secret devotion to the gods of Homer and Plato.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_581" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_581_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">120</a> The Italians <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>292<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> were oppressed by the strength and number of their ancient auxiliaries: the century after the deaths of Petrarch and Boccace was filled with a crowd of Latin imitators, who decently repose on our shelves; but in that era of learning it will not be easy to discern a real discovery of science, a work of invention or eloquence, in the popular language of the country.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_582" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_582_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">121</a> But, as soon as it had been deeply saturated with the celestial dew, the soil was quickened into vegetation and life; the modern idioms were refined; the classics of Athens and Rome inspired a pure taste and a generous emulation; and in Italy, as afterwards in France and England, the pleasing reign of poetry and fiction was succeeded by the light of speculative and experimental philosophy. Genius may anticipate the season of maturity; but in the education of a people, as in that of an individual, memory must be exercised, before the powers of reason and fancy can be expanded; nor may the artist hope to equal or surpass, till he has learned to imitate, the works of his predecessors.</p>

Those gods and those men had long since vanished; but, to the eye of liberal enthusiasm, the majesty of ruin restored the image of her ancient prosperity. The monuments of the consuls and C=C3=A6sars, of the martyrs and apostles, engaged on all sides the curiosity of the philosopher and the Christian; and he confessed that in every age the arms and religion of Rome were destined to reign over the earth. While Chrysoloras admired the venerable beauties of the mother, he was not forgetful of his native country, her fairest daughter, her Imperial colony; and the Byzantine patriot expatiates with zeal and truth on the eternal advantages of nature and the more transitory glories of art and <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>294<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> dominion, which adorned, or had adorned, the city of Constantine. Yet the perfection of the copy still redounds (as he modestly observes) to the honour of the original; and parents are delighted to be renewed, and even excelled, by the superior merit of their children. =E2=80=9CConstantinople,=E2=80=9D says the orator, =E2=80=9Cis situate on a commanding point, between Europe and Asia, between the Archipelago and the Euxine. By her interposition, the two seas and the two continents are united for the common benefit of nations; and the gates of commerce may be shut or opened at her command. The harbour, encompassed on all sides by the sea and the continent, is the most secure and capacious in the world. The walls and gates of Constantinople may be compared with those of Babylon; the towers are many; each tower is a solid and lofty structure; and the second wall, the outer fortification, would be sufficient for the defence and dignity of an ordinary capital. A broad and rapid stream may be introduced into the ditches; and the artificial island may be encompassed, like Athens,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_584" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_584_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> by land or water.=E2=80=9D Two strong and natural causes are alleged for the perfection of the model of new Rome. The royal founder reigned over the most illustrious nations of the globe; and, in the accomplishment of his designs, the power of the Romans was combined with the art and science of the Greeks. Other cities have been reared to maturity by accident and time; their beauties are mingled with disorder and deformity; and the inhabitants, unwilling to remove from their natal spot, are incapable of correcting the errors of their ancestors and the original vices of situation or climate. But the free idea of Constantinople was formed and executed by a single mind; and the primitive model was improved by the obedient zeal of the subjects and successors of the first <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>295<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> monarch. The adjacent isles were stored with an inexhaustible supply of marble; but the various materials were transported from the most remote shores of Europe and Asia; and the public and private buildings, the palaces, churches, aqueducts, cisterns, porticoes, columns, baths, and hippodromes, were adapted to the greatness of the capital of the East. The superfluity of wealth was spread along the shores of Europe and Asia; and the Byzantine territory, as far as the Euxine, the Hellespont, and the long wall, might be considered as a populous suburb and a perpetual garden. In this flattering picture, the past and the present, the times of prosperity and decay, are artfully confounded; but a sigh and a confession escape from the orator, that his wretched country was the shadow and sepulchre of its former self. The works of ancient sculpture had been defaced by Christian zeal or Barbaric violence; the fairest structures were demolished; and the marbles of Paros or Numidia were burnt for lime or applied to the meanest uses. Of many a statue, the place was marked by an empty pedestal; of many a column, the size was determined by a broken capital; the tombs of the emperors were scattered on the ground; the stroke of time was accelerated by storms and earthquakes; and the vacant space was adorned, by vulgar tradition, with fabulous monuments of gold and silver. From these wonders, which lived only in memory or belief, he distinguishes, however, the porphyry pillar, the column and colossus of Justinian,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_585" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_585_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">3</a> and the church, <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>296<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> more especially the dome, of St. Sophia: the best conclusion, since it could not be described according to its merits, and after it no other object could deserve to be mentioned. But he forgets that a century before the trembling fabrics of the colossus and the church had been saved and supported by the timely care of Andronicus the Elder. Thirty years after the emperor had fortified St. Sophia with two new buttresses, or pyramids, the eastern hemisphere suddenly gave way; and the images, the altars, and the sanctuary were crushed by the falling ruin. The mischief indeed was speedily repaired; the rubbish was cleared by the incessant labour of every rank and age; and the poor remains of riches and industry were consecrated by the Greeks to the most stately and venerable temple of the East.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_586" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_586_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">4</a></p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_396">The last hope of the falling city and empire was placed in the harmony of the mother and daughter, in the maternal tenderness of Rome and the filial obedience of Constantinople.

No sooner did they land on the Byzantine shore than they were saluted, or rather assailed, with a general murmur of zeal and discontent. During their absence, above two years, the capital had been deprived of its civil and ecclesiastical rulers; fanaticism fermented in anarchy; the most furious monks reigned over the conscience of women and bigots; and the hatred of the Latin name was the first principle of nature and religion. Before his departure for Italy, the emperor had flattered the city with the assurance of a prompt relief and a powerful succour; and the clergy, confident in their orthodoxy and science, had promised themselves and their flocks an easy victory over the blind shepherds of the West. The double disappointment exasperated the Greeks; the conscience of the subscribing prelates was awakened; the hour of temptation was past; and they had more to dread from the public resentment than they could hope from the favour of the emperor or the pope. Instead of justifying their conduct, they deplored their weakness, professed their contrition, and cast themselves on the mercy of God and of their brethren. To the reproachful question, What had been the event or use of their Italian synod? they answered, with sighs and tears, =E2=80=9CAlas! we have made a new faith; we have exchanged piety for impiety; we have betrayed the immaculate sacrifice; and we are become <i>Azymites.</i>=E2=80=9D (The Azymites were those who celebrated the communion with unleavened bread; and I must retract or qualify the praise which I have bestowed on the growing philosophy of the times.) =E2=80=9CAlas! we have been seduced by distress, by fraud, and by the hopes and fears of a transitory life. The hand that has signed the union should be cut off; and the tongue that has pronounced the Latin creed deserves to be torn from the root.=E2=80=9D The best proof of their repentance was an increase of zeal for the most trivial rites and the most incomprehensible doctrines; and an absolute separation from all, without excepting their prince, who preserved some <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>298<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> regard for honour and consistency. After the decease of the patriarch Joseph, the archbishops of Heraclea and Trebizond had courage to refuse the vacant office; and Cardinal Bessarion preferred the warm and comfortable shelter of the Vatican. The choice of the emperor and his clergy was confined to Metrophanes of Cyzicus: he was consecrated in St. Sophia, but the temple was vacant; the cross-bearers abdicated their service; the infection spread from the city to the villages; and Metrophanes discharged, without effect, some ecclesiastical thunders against a nation of schismatics. The eyes of the Greeks were directed to Mark of Ephesus, the champion of his country; and the sufferings of the holy confessor were repaid with a tribute of admiration and applause. His example and writings propagated the flame of religious discord; age and infirmity soon removed him from the world; but the gospel of Mark was not a law of forgiveness; and he requested with his dying breath that none of the adherents of Rome might attend his obsequies or pray for his soul.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_589" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_589_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">7</a></p>

Secure under the Mamaluke sceptre, the three patriarchs of Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem assembled a numerous synod; disowned their representatives at Ferrara and Florence; condemned the creed and council of the Latins; and threatened the emperor of Constantinople with the censures of the Eastern church. Of the sectaries of the Greek communion, the Russians were the most powerful, ignorant, and superstitious. Their primate, the cardinal Isidore, hastened from Florence to Moscow,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_590" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_590_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">8</a> to reduce the independent nation under the Roman yoke. But the Russian bishops had been educated at Mount Athos; and the prince and people embraced the theology of their priests. They were scandalised by the title, the pomp, the Latin cross, of the legate, the friend of those impious men who shaved their beards and performed the divine office with gloves on their hands and rings on their fingers. Isidore was condemned by a synod; his person was imprisoned in a monastery; and it was with extreme difficulty that the cardinal could escape from the hands of a fierce and fanatic people.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_591" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_591_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">9</a> The Russians refused a passage to the missionaries of Rome, who aspired to convert the pagans beyond the Tanais;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_592" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_592_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">10</a> and their refusal <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>300<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> was justified by the maxim that the guilt of idolatry is less damnable than that of schism.

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_398">=E2=80=9CSultan Murad, or Amurath, lived forty-nine, and reigned thirty years, six months, and eight days. He was a just and valiant prince, of a great soul, patient of labours, learned, merciful, religious, charitable; a lover and encourager of the studious, and of all who excelled in any art or science; a good emperor, and a great general. No man obtained more or greater victories than Amurath; Belgrade alone withstood his attacks. Under his reign, the soldier was ever victorious, the citizen rich and secure. If he subdued any country, his first care was to build moschs and caravanseras, hospitals, and colleges. Every year he gave a thousand pieces of gold to the sons of the Prophet; and sent two thousand five hundred to the religious persons of Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem.=E2=80=9D<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_594" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_594_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">12</a> This portrait is transcribed from the historian of the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>301<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> Othman empire; but the applause of a servile and superstitious people has been lavished on the worst of tyrants; and the virtues of a sultan are often the vices most useful to himself, or most agreeable to his subjects. A nation ignorant of the equal benefits of liberty and law must be awed by the flashes of arbitrary power: the cruelty of a despot will assume the character of justice; his profusion, of liberality; his obstinacy, of firmness. If the most reasonable excuse be rejected, few acts of obedience will be found impossible; and guilt must tremble where innocence cannot always be secure. The tranquillity of the people and the discipline of the troops were best maintained by perpetual action in the field; war was the trade of the Janizaries; and those who survived the peril and divided the spoil applauded the generous ambition of their sovereign. To propagate the true religion was the duty of a faithful Musulman: the unbelievers were <i>his</i> enemies, and those of the Prophet; and, in the hands of the Turks, the scymetar was the only instrument of conversion. Under these circumstances, however, the justice and moderation of Amurath are attested by his conduct and acknowledged by the Christians themselves; who consider a prosperous reign and a peaceful death as the reward of his singular merits. In the vigour of his age and military power, he seldom engaged in a war till he was justified by a previous and adequate provocation; the victorious sultan was disarmed by submission; and in the observance of <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>302<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> treaties his word was inviolate and sacred.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_595" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_595_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">13</a> The Hungarians were commonly the aggressors; he was provoked by the revolt of Scanderbeg; and the perfidious Caramanian was twice vanquished and twice pardoned by the Ottoman monarch.

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_399">But the most striking feature in the life and character of Amurath is the double abdication of the Turkish throne; and, were not his motives debased by an alloy of superstition, we must praise the royal philosopher,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_597" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_597_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">15</a> who, at the age of forty, could discern the vanity of human greatness.

These pious occupations were again interrupted by the danger of the state. A victorious army disdained the inexperience of their youthful ruler; the city of Hadrianople was abandoned to rapine and slaughter; and the unanimous divan implored his presence to appease the tumult, and prevent the rebellion, of the Janizaries. At the well-known voice of their master, they trembled and obeyed; and the reluctant sultan was compelled to support his splendid servitude, till, at the end of four years, he was relieved by the angel of death. Age or disease, misfortune or caprice, have tempted several princes to descend from the throne; and they have had leisure to repent of their irretrievable step.

But the spirit of the crusades had expired; and the coldness of the Franks was not less unreasonable than their headlong passion.

The maritime republics of Venice and Genoa were less remote from the scene of action; and their hostile fleets were associated under the standard of St. Peter. The kingdoms of Hungary and Poland, which covered, as it were, the interior pale of the Latin church, were the most nearly concerned to oppose the progress of the Turks.

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_401">Of the Polish and Hungarian diets, a religious war was the unanimous cry; and Ladislaus, after passing the Danube, led an army of his confederate subjects as far as Sophia, the capital of the Bulgarian kingdom.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_606" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_606_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">24</a> In this expedition they obtained two signal victories, which were justly ascribed to the valour and conduct of Huniades. In the first, with a vanguard of ten thousand men, he surprised the Turkish camp; in the second, he vanquished and made prisoner the most renowned of their generals, who possessed the double advantage of ground and numbers. The approach of winter and the natural and artificial obstacles of Mount H=C3=A6mus arrested the progress of the hero, who measured a narrow interval of six days=E2=80=99 march from the foot of the mountains to the hostile towers of Hadrianople and the friendly capital of the Greek empire. The retreat was undisturbed; and the entrance into Buda was at once a military and religious triumph. An ecclesiastical procession was followed by the king and his warriors on foot; he nicely balanced the merits and rewards of the two nations; and the pride of conquest <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>307<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> was blended with the humble temper of Christianity. Thirteen bashaws, nine standards, and four thousand captives were unquestionable trophies; and, as all were willing to believe and none were present to contradict, the crusaders multiplied, with unblushing confidence, the myriads of Turks whom they had left on the field of battle.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_607" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_607_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">25</a> The most solid proof and the most salutary consequence of victory was a deputation from the divan to solicit peace, to restore Servia, to ransom the prisoners, and to evacuate the Hungarian frontier. By this treaty, the rational objects of the war were obtained: the king, the despot, and Huniades himself, in the diet of Segedin, were satisfied with public and private emolument; a truce of ten years was concluded; and the followers of Jesus and Mahomet, who swore on the Gospel and the Koran, attested the word of God as the guardian of truth and the avenger of perfidy. In the place of the Gospel, the Turkish ministers had proposed to substitute the Eucharist, the real presence of the Catholic deity; but the Christians refused to profane their holy mysteries; and a superstitious conscience is less forcibly bound by the spiritual energy, than by the outward and visible symbols, of an oath.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_608" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_608_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">26</a></p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_402">During the whole transaction the cardinal-legate had observed a sullen silence, unwilling to approve, and unable to oppose, the consent of the king and people. But the diet was not dissolved before Julian was fortified by the welcome intelligence that Anatolia was invaded by the Caramanian, and Thrace by the Greek emperor; that the fleets of Genoa, Venice, and Burgundy were masters of the Hellespont; and <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>308<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> that the allies, informed of the victory, and ignorant of the treaty, of Ladislaus, impatiently waited for the return of his victorious army. =E2=80=9CAnd is it thus,=E2=80=9D exclaimed the cardinal,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_609" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_609_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">27</a> =E2=80=9Cthat you will desert their expectations and your own fortune? It is to them, to your God, and your fellow-Christians, that you have pledged your faith; and that prior obligation annihilates a rash and sacrilegious oath to the enemies of Christ. His vicar on earth is the Roman pontiff; without whose sanction you can neither promise nor perform. In his name I absolve your perjury and sanctify your arms; follow my footsteps in the paths of glory and salvation; and, if still ye have scruples, devolve on my head the punishment and the sin.=E2=80=9D This mischievous casuistry was seconded by his respectable character and the levity of popular assemblies. War was resolved on the same spot where peace had so lately been sworn; and, in the execution of the treaty, the Turks were assaulted by the Christians; to whom, with some reason, they might apply the epithet of Infidels. The falsehood of Ladislaus to his word and oath was palliated by the religion of the times; the most perfect, or at least the most popular, excuse would have been the success of his arms and the deliverance of the Eastern church. But the same treaty which should have bound his conscience had diminished his strength. On the proclamation of the peace, the French and German volunteers departed with indignant murmurs; the Poles were exhausted by distant warfare, and perhaps disgusted with foreign command; and their palatines accepted the first licence and hastily retired to their provinces and castles. Even Hungary was divided by faction or restrained by a <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>309<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> laudable scruple; and the relics of the crusade that marched in the second expedition were reduced to an inadequate force of twenty thousand men. A Walachian chief, who joined the royal standard with his vassals, presumed to remark that their numbers did not exceed the hunting retinue that sometimes attended the sultan; and the gift of two horses of matchless speed might admonish Ladislaus of his secret foresight of the event. But the despot of Servia, after the restoration of his country and children, was tempted by the promise of new realms; and the inexperience of the king, the enthusiasm of the legate, and the martial presumption of Huniades himself were persuaded that every obstacle must yield to the invincible virtue of the sword and the cross. After the passage of the Danube, two roads might lead to Constantinople and the Hellespont: the one direct, abrupt, and difficult, through the mountains of H=C3=A6mus; the other more tedious and secure, over a level country, and along the shores of the Euxine; in which their flanks, according to the Scythian discipline, might always be covered by a moveable fortification of waggons. The latter was judiciously preferred: the Catholics marched through the plains of Bulgaria, burning, with wanton cruelty, the churches and villages of the Christian natives; and their last station was at Warna, near the seashore, on which the defeat and death of Ladislaus have bestowed a memorable name.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_610" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_610_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">28</a></p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_403">It was on this fatal spot that, instead of finding a confederate fleet to second their operations, they were alarmed by the approach of Amurath himself, who had issued from his Magnesian solitude and transported the forces of Asia to the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>310<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> defence of Europe. According to some writers, the Greek emperor had been awed, or seduced, to grant the passage of the Bosphorus; and an indelible stain of corruption is fixed on the Genoese, or the pope=E2=80=99s nephew, the Catholic admiral, whose mercenary connivance betrayed the guard of the Hellespont.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_611" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_611_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">29</a> From Hadrianople, the sultan advanced, by hasty marches, at the head of sixty thousand men; and, when the cardinal and Huniades had taken a nearer survey of the numbers and order of the Turks, these ardent warriors proposed the tardy and impracticable measure of a retreat. The king alone was resolved to conquer or die; and his resolution had almost been crowned with a glorious and salutary victory. The princes were opposite to each other in the centre; and the Beglerbegs, or generals of Anatolia and Romania, commanded on the right and left against the adverse divisions of the despot and Huniades. The Turkish wings were broken on the first onset; but the advantage was fatal; and the rash victors, in the heat of the pursuit, were carried away far from the annoyance of the enemy or the support of their friends. When Amurath beheld the flight of his squadrons, he despaired of his fortune and that of the empire: a veteran Janizary seized his horse=E2=80=99s bridle; and he had magnanimity to pardon and reward the soldier who dared to perceive the terror, and arrest the flight, of his sovereign. A copy of the treaty, the monument of Christian perfidy, had been displayed in the front of battle; and it is said that the sultan in his distress, lifting his eyes and his hands to heaven, implored the protection of the God of truth; and called on the prophet Jesus himself to avenge the impious mockery of his name and religion.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_612" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_612_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">30</a> With inferior numbers <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>311<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> and disordered ranks, the king of Hungary rushed forwards in the confidence of victory, till his career was stopped by the impenetrable phalanx of the Janizaries.

On his return from an intemperate pursuit, Huniades deplored his error and the public loss; he strove to rescue the royal body, till he was overwhelmed by the tumultuous crowd of the victors and vanquished; and the last efforts of his courage and conduct were exerted to save the remnant of his Walachian cavalry. Ten thousand Christians were slain in the disastrous battle of Warna. The loss of the Turks, more considerable in numbers, bore a smaller proportion to their total strength; yet the philosophic sultan was not ashamed to confess that his ruin must be the consequence of a second and similar victory. At his command, a column was erected on the spot where Ladislaus had fallen; but the modest inscription, instead of accusing the rashness, recorded the valour, and bewailed the misfortune, of the Hungarian youth.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_614" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_614_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">32</a></p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_404">Before I lose sight of the field of Warna, I am tempted to pause on the character and story of two principal actors, the cardinal Julian, and John Huniades. Julian<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_615" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_615_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">33</a> C=C3=A6sarini was born of a noble family of Rome; his studies had embraced both the Latin and Greek learning, both the sciences of divinity and law; and his versatile genius was equally adapted to the schools, the camp, and the court. No sooner had he been invested with the Roman purple than he was sent into Germany to arm the empire against the rebels and heretics of Bohemia. The spirit of persecution is unworthy of a Christian; the military profession ill becomes a priest; but the former is excused by the times; and the latter was ennobled by the courage of Julian, who stood dauntless and alone in the disgraceful flight of the German host. As the pope=E2=80=99s legate, he opened the council of Basil; but the president soon appeared the most strenuous champion of ecclesiastical freedom; and an opposition of seven years was conducted by his ability and zeal. After promoting the strongest measures against the authority and person of Eugenius, some secret motive of interest or conscience engaged him to desert, on a sudden, the popular party. The cardinal withdrew himself from Basil to Ferrara; and, in the debates of the Greeks and Latins, the two nations admired the dexterity of his arguments and the depth of his theological erudition.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_616" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_616_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">34</a> In his <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>313<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> Hungarian embassy we have already seen the mischievous effects of his sophistry and eloquence, of which Julian himself was the first victim. The cardinal, who performed the duties of a priest and a soldier, was lost in the defeat of Warna. The circumstances of his death are variously related; but it is believed that a weighty incumbrance of gold impeded his flight, and tempted the cruel avarice of some Christian fugitives.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_405">From an humble or at least a doubtful origin, the merit of John Huniades promoted him to the command of the Hungarian armies. His father was a Walachian, his mother a Greek: her unknown race might possibly ascend to the emperors of Constantinople; and the claims of the Walachians, with the surname of Corvinus, from the place of his nativity, might suggest a thin pretence for mingling his blood with the patricians of ancient Rome.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_617" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_617_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">35</a> In his youth, he served in the wars of Italy, and was retained, with twelve horsemen, by the bishop of Zagrab; the valour of the <i>white knight</i><a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_618" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_618_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">36</a> was soon conspicuous; he increased his fortunes by a noble and wealthy marriage; and in the defence of the Hungarian borders he won, in the same year, three battles against the Turks. By his influence, Ladislaus of Poland obtained the crown of Hungary; and the important service was rewarded by the title and office of Waivod of Transylvania. The <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>314<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> first of Julian=E2=80=99s crusades added two Turkish laurels on his brow; and in the public distress the fatal errors of Warna were forgotten. During the absence and minority of Ladislaus of Austria, the titular king, Huniades was elected supreme captain and governor of Hungary; and, if envy at first was silenced by terror, a reign of twelve years supposes the arts of policy as well as of war. Yet the idea of a consummate general is not delineated in his campaigns; the white knight fought with the hand rather than the head, as the chief of desultory Barbarians, who attack without fear and fly without shame; and his military life is composed of a romantic alternative of victories and escapes. By the Turks, who employed his name to frighten their perverse children, he was corruptly denominated <i>Jancus Lain</i>, or the Wicked; their hatred is the proof of their esteem; the kingdom which he guarded was inaccessible to their arms; and they felt him most daring and formidable, when they fondly believed the captain of his country irrecoverably lost. Instead of confining himself to a defensive war, four years after the defeat of Warna he again penetrated into the heart of Bulgaria; and in the plain of Cossova sustained, till the third day, the shock of the Ottoman army, four times more numerous than his own. As he fled alone through the woods of Walachia, the hero was surprised by two robbers; but, while they disputed a gold chain that hung at his neck, he recovered his sword, slew the one, terrified the other; and, after new perils of captivity or death, consoled by his presence an afflicted kingdom. But the last and most glorious action of his life was the defence of Belgrade against the powers of Mahomet the Second in person. After a siege of forty days, the Turks, who had already entered the town, were compelled to retreat; and the joyful nations celebrated Huniades and Belgrade as the bulwarks of Christendom.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_619" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_619_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">37</a> About a month <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>315<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> after this great deliverance, the champion expired; and his most splendid epitaph is the regret of the Ottoman prince, who sighed that he could no longer hope for revenge against the single antagonist who had triumphed over his arms. On the first vacancy of the throne, Matthias Corvinus, a youth of eighteen years of age, was elected and crowned by the grateful Hungarians. His reign was prosperous and long. Matthias aspired to the glory of a conqueror and a saint; but his purest merit is the encouragement of learning; and the Latin orators and historians, who were invited from Italy by the son, have shed the lustre of their eloquence on the father=E2=80=99s character.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_620" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_620_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">38</a></p>

Unable to contend with the sultan=E2=80=99s power, Castriot submitted to the hard conditions of peace and tribute; he delivered his four sons as the pledges of his fidelity; and the Christian youths, after receiving the mark of circumcision, were instructed in the Mahometan religion, and trained in the arms and arts of Turkish policy.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_623" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_623_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">41</a> The three elder brothers were confounded in the crowd of slaves; and the poison to which their deaths are ascribed cannot be verified or disproved by any positive evidence. Yet the suspicion is in a great measure removed by the kind and paternal treatment of George Castriot, the fourth brother, who, from his tender youth, displayed the strength and spirit of a soldier. The successive overthrow of a Tartar and two Persians, who carried a proud defiance to the Turkish court, recommended him to the favour of Amurath, and his Turkish appellation of Scanderbeg (<i>Iskender beg</i>), or the lord Alexander, is an indelible memorial of his glory and servitude. His father=E2=80=99s principality was reduced into a province; but the loss was compensated by the rank and title of Sanjiak, a command of five thousand horse, and the prospect of the first dignities of <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>317<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> the empire. He served with honour in the wars of Europe and Asia; and we may smile at the art or credulity of the historian, who supposes that in every encounter he spared the Christians, while he fell with a thundering arm on his Musulman foes. The glory of Huniades is without reproach: he fought in the defence of his religion and country; but the enemies who applaud the patriot have branded his rival with the name of traitor and apostate. In the eyes of the Christians the rebellion of Scanderbeg is justified by his father=E2=80=99s wrongs, the ambiguous death of his three brothers, his own degradation, and the slavery of his country; and they adore the generous though tardy zeal with which he asserted the faith and independence of his ancestors. But he had imbibed from his ninth year the doctrines of the Koran; he was ignorant of the Gospel; the religion of a soldier is determined by authority and habit; nor is it easy to conceive what new illumination at the age of forty<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_624" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_624_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">42</a> could be poured into his soul. His motives would be less exposed to the suspicion of interest or revenge, had he broken his chain from the moment that he was sensible of its weight; but a long oblivion had surely impaired his original right; and every year of obedience and reward had cemented the mutual bond of the sultan and his subject. If Scanderbeg had long harboured the belief of Christianity and the intention of revolt, a worthy mind must condemn the base dissimulation, that could only serve to betray, that could promise only to be forsworn, that could actively join in the temporal and spiritual perdition of so many thousands of his unhappy brethren. Shall we praise a secret correspondence with Huniades, while he commanded the vanguard of the Turkish army? shall we <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>318<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> excuse the desertion of his standard, a treacherous desertion, which abandoned the victory to the enemies of his benefactor? In the confusion of a defeat, the eye of Scanderbeg was fixed on the Reis Effendi, or principal secretary; with a dagger at his breast, he extorted a firman or patent for the government of Albania; and the murder of the guiltless scribe and his train prevented the consequences of an immediate discovery. With some bold companions, to whom he had revealed his design, he escaped in the night, by rapid marches, from the field of battle to his paternal mountains. The gates of Croya were opened to the royal mandate; and no sooner did he command the fortress than George Castriot dropped the mask of dissimulation, abjured the Prophet and the sultan, and proclaimed himself the avenger of his family and country. The names of religion and liberty provoked a general revolt: the Albanians, a martial race, were unanimous to live and die with their hereditary prince; and the Ottoman garrisons were indulged in the choice of martyrdom or baptism. In the assembly of the states of Epirus, Scanderbeg was elected general of the Turkish war; and each of the allies engaged to furnish his respective proportion of men and money. From these contributions, from his patrimonial estate, and from the valuable salt-pits of Selina, he drew an annual revenue of two hundred thousand ducats;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_625" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_625_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">43</a> and the entire sum, exempt from the demands of luxury, was strictly appropriated to the public use. His manners were popular; but his discipline was severe; and every superfluous vice was banished from his camp; his example strengthened his command; and under his conduct the Albanians were invincible in their own opinion and that of their enemies. The bravest adventurers of France and Germany were allured by his fame and retained in his service; his standing militia consisted of eight thousand horse and seven thousand foot; the horses were small, the men were active; but he viewed with <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>319<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> a discerning eye the difficulties and resources of the mountains; and, at the blaze of the beacons, the whole nation was distributed in the strongest posts. With such unequal arms, Scanderbeg resisted twenty-three years the powers of the Ottoman empire; and two conquerors, Amurath the Second and his greater son, were repeatedly baffled by a rebel whom they pursued with seeming contempt and implacable resentment. At the head of sixty thousand horse and forty thousand Janizaries,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_626" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_626_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">44</a> Amurath entered Albania: he might ravage the open country, occupy the defenceless towns, convert the churches into moschs, circumcise the Christian youths, and punish with death his adult and obstinate captives, but the conquests of the sultan were confined to the petty fortress of Sfetigrade; and the garrison, invincible to his arms, was oppressed by a paltry artifice and a superstitious scruple.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_627" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_627_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">45</a> Amurath retired with shame and loss from the walls of Croya, the castle and residence of the Castriots; the march, the siege, the retreat, were harassed by a vexatious and almost invisible adversary;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_628" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_628_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">46</a> and the disappointment might tend to embitter, perhaps to shorten, the last days of the sultan.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_629" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_629_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">47</a> In the fulness of conquest, Mahomet the Second still felt at his bosom this domestic thorn; his lieutenants <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>320<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> were permitted to negotiate a truce; and the Albanian prince may justly be praised as a firm and able champion of his national independence. The enthusiasm of chivalry and religion has ranked him with the names of Alexander and Pyrrhus, nor would they blush to acknowledge their intrepid countryman; but his narrow dominion and slender powers must leave him at an humble distance below the heroes of antiquity, who triumphed over the East and the Roman legions. His splendid achievements, the bashaws whom he encountered, the armies that he discomfited, and the three thousand Turks who were slain by his single hand, must be weighed in the scales of suspicious criticism. Against an illiterate enemy, and in the dark solitude of Epirus, his partial biographers may safely indulge the latitude of romance; but their fictions are exposed by the light of Italian history; and they afford a strong presumption against their own truth by a fabulous tale of his exploits, when he passed the Adriatic with eight hundred horse to the succour of the king of Naples.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_630" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_630_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">48</a> Without disparagement to his fame, they might have owned that he was finally oppressed by the Ottoman powers; in his extreme danger, he applied to Pope Pius the Second for a refuge in the ecclesiastical state; and his resources were almost exhausted, since Scanderbeg died a fugitive at Lissus, on the Venetian territory.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_631" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_631_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">49</a> His sepulchre was soon violated <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>321<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> by the Turkish conquerors; but the Janizaries, who wore his bones enchased in a bracelet, declared by this superstitious amulet their involuntary reverence for his valour. The instant ruin of his country may redound to the hero=E2=80=99s glory; yet, had he balanced the consequences of submission and resistance, a patriot, perhaps, would have declined the unequal contest which must depend on the life and genius of one man. Scanderbeg might indeed be supported by the rational though fallacious hope that the pope, the king of Naples, and the Venetian republic would join in the defence of a free and Christian people, who guarded the sea-coast of the Adriatic and the narrow passage from Greece to Italy.

Of these the first and the last were far distant in the Morea; but Demetrius, who possessed the domain of Selybria, was in the suburbs, at the head of a party; his ambition was not chilled by the public distress; and his conspiracy with the Turks and the schismatics had already disturbed the peace of his country. The funeral of the late emperor was accelerated with singular and even suspicious haste; the claim of Demetrius to the vacant throne was justified by a trite and flimsy sophism, that he was born in the purple, the eldest son of his father=E2=80=99s reign. But the empress-mother, the senate and soldiers, the clergy and people, were unanimous in the cause of the lawful successor; and the despot Thomas, who, ignorant of the change, accidentally returned to the capital, asserted with becoming zeal the interest of his absent brother. An ambassador, the historian Phranza, was immediately despatched to the court of Hadrianople. Amurath received him with honour, and dismissed him with gifts; but the gracious approbation of the Turkish sultan announced his supremacy, and the approaching downfall of the Eastern empire. By the hands of two illustrious deputies, the Imperial crown was placed at Sparta on the head of Constantine.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_636" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_636_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">54</a> In the spring, he sailed from the Morea, escaped the encounter of a Turkish squadron, enjoyed the acclamations of his subjects, celebrated the festival of a new reign, and exhausted by his donatives the treasure, or rather the indigence, of the state. The emperor immediately resigned to his brothers the possession of the Morea, and the brittle friendship of the two princes, Demetrius and Thomas, was confirmed in their mother=E2=80=99s presence <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>323<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> by the frail security of oaths and embraces. His next occupation was the choice of a consort. A daughter of the doge of Venice had been proposed; but the Byzantine nobles objected the distance between an hereditary monarch and an elective magistrate; and in their subsequent distress the chief of that powerful republic was not unmindful of the affront. Constantine afterwards hesitated between the royal families of Trebizond and Georgia; and the embassy of Phranza represents in his public and private life the last days of the Byzantine empire.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_637" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_637_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">55</a></p>

His numerous retinue consisted of nobles and guards, of physicians and monks; he was attended by a band of music; and the term of his costly embassy was protracted above two years. On his arrival in Georgia or Iberia, the natives from the towns and villages flocked around the strangers; and such was their simplicity that they were delighted with the effects, without understanding the cause, of musical harmony.

Instead of rejoicing in the deliverance, the experienced statesman expressed his apprehension that an ambitious youth would not long adhere to the sage and pacific system of his father. After the sultan=E2=80=99s decease, his Christian wife Maria,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_641" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_641_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">59</a> the daughter of the Servian despot, had been honourably restored to her parents: on the fame of her beauty and merit, she was recommended by the ambassador as the most worthy object of the royal choice; and Phranza recapitulates and refutes the specious objections that might be raised against the proposal. The majesty of the purple would ennoble an unequal alliance; the bar of affinity might be removed by liberal alms and the dispensation of the church; the disgrace of Turkish nuptials had been repeatedly overlooked; and, though the fair Maria was near fifty years of age, she might yet hope to give an heir to the empire. Constantine listened to the advice, which was transmitted in the first ship that sailed from Trebizond; but the factions of the court opposed his marriage; and it was finally prevented by the pious vow of the sultana, who ended her days in the monastic profession. Reduced to the first alternative, the choice of Phranza was decided in favour of a Georgian princess; and the vanity of her father was dazzled by the glorious alliance. Instead of demanding, according to the primitive and national custom, a price for his daughter,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_642" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_642_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">60</a> he offered a portion of fifty-six thousand, with an annual pension of five thousand, ducats; and the services of the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>325<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> ambassador were repaid by an assurance that, as his son had been adopted in baptism by the emperor, the establishment of his daughter should be the peculiar care of the empress of Constantinople. On the return of Phranza, the treaty was ratified by the Greek monarch, who with his own hand impressed three vermilion crosses on the Golden Bull, and assured the Georgian envoy that in the spring his galleys should conduct the bride to her Imperial palace. But Constantine embraced his faithful servant, not with the cold approbation of a sovereign, but with the warm confidence of a friend, who, after a long absence, is impatient to pour his secrets into the bosom of his friend. =E2=80=9CSince the death of my mother and of Cantacuzene, who alone advised me without interest or passion,<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_643" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_643_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">61</a> I am surrounded,=E2=80=9D said the emperor, =E2=80=9Cby men whom I can neither love nor trust nor esteem.

The marriage was immediately stipulated; but the office, however incompatible with his own, had been usurped by the ambition of the admiral. Some delay was requisite to negotiate a consent and an equivalent; and the nomination of Phranza was half declared and half suppressed, lest it might be displeasing to an insolent and powerful favourite. The winter was spent in the preparations of his embassy; and Phranza had resolved that the youth his son should embrace this opportunity of foreign travel, and be left, on the appearance of danger, with his maternal kindred of the Morea. Such were the private and public designs, which were interrupted by a Turkish war, and finally buried in the ruins of the empire.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_644" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_644_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">62</a></p>

He was a man of great ability, and, though we may wish that he had not set it before himself to imitate Herodotus and Thucydides, we must recognise the talent which he displayed in handling a most intractable period of history. It is very interesting to pass from his predecessors in the series of the Byzantine historians to this writer. We no longer watch events from the single and simple standpoint of Constantinople. The true theme of Chalcondyles is not the decline of the diminished empire, but the growth and development of the Ottoman State.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_646" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_646_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">2</a> The centre of events shifts with the movements of the sultan.

He was secretary of the Genoese podest=C3=A0 at Phocaea, before the siege of Constantinople, and afterwards he was employed by the Gattilusi of Lesbos as an ambassador to the sultan. His connection with the Genoese helped, probably, to determine his ecclesiastical views; he was a hearty supporter of union with the Latin Church, as the great safeguard against the Turks. His History covers the period 1341-1462; he is more accurate than Chalcondyles. In language he is not a purist; his work is full of foreign words. (Ed. Bullialdus (Paris), 1649; ed.

Although he is not out of sympathy with his countrymen, he has thrown his lot in with the conquerors, and he writes from the Turkish point of view. This is the interesting feature of his work, which is thus sharply contrasted with the histories of Chalcondyles and Ducas. He inscribes the book, in a dedicatory epistle, to Mohammad himself, whom he compares to Alexander the Great. Like Ducas and Chalcondyles, he describes the siege of Constantinople at second hand; but like theirs his very full description is a most valuable source for comparison with the accounts of the eyewitnesses. He can indeed be convicted of many small inaccuracies. For example, he states that Giustiniani was wounded in the chest, and that Constantine was slain near the Cercoporta; and in other parts of his work, his chronology is at fault. He was an imitator of Thucydides, and puts Thucydidean speeches into the mouth of Mohammad.

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_421">Of Chinese authorities for the history of the Mongols, the most important is the annals entitled <span class=3D"csc">Yuan Shi</span>, of which Bretschneider (Mediaeval Researches for Eastern Asiatic Sources, 1888) gives the following account (vol. i. p. 180 <i>sqq.</i>). In 1369 =E2=80=9Cthe detailed records of the reigns of the thirteen Y=C3=BCan emperors were procured, and the emperor (Hungwu) gave orders to compile the history of the Y=C3=BCan [Mongols], under the direction of <i>Sung Lien</i> and <i>Wang Wei.</i> The work, which occupied sixteen scholars, was begun in the second month of 1369 and finished in the eighth month of the same year. But as at that time the record of the reign of Shun ti (the last Mongol emperor in China) was not yet received, the scholar <i>Ou yang Yu</i> and others were sent to <i>Pei p=E2=80=99ing</i> to obtain the required information. In the sixth month of 1370 the Y=C3=BCan Shi was complete.=E2=80=9D There were various subsequent <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>330<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> editions. =E2=80=9CThe Y=C3=BCan Shi has been compiled from official documents. Perhaps we must except the biographies, for which the information was probably often derived from private sources. It seems that the greater part of the documents on which the Chinese history of the Mongols is based had been drawn up in the Chinese language; but in some cases they appear to have been translated from the Mongol. I conclude this from the fact that in the Y=C3=BCan Shi places are often mentioned, not, as usually, by their Chinese names, but by their Mongol names represented in Chinese characters=E2=80=9D (p. 183). The Yuan Shi (p. 185 <i>sqq.</i>) is divided into four sections: (1) consists of the lives of the 13 Mongol Khans in Mongolia and China, and the annals of their reigns from Chingiz to Shun ti (1368); (2) memoirs (geographical, astronomical, politico-economical notices; regulations on dress, rites, public appointments, etc.; military ordinances, etc.); (3) genealogical tables and lists; (4) about a thousand biographies of eminent men of the period [Bretschneider observes that these biographies =E2=80=9Cbear evidence to the liberal views of the Mongol emperors as to the acknowledgment of merit. They seem never to have been influenced by national considerations=E2=80=9D]; and notices of foreign lands and nations south and east of China (<i>e.g.</i>, Korea, Japan, Burma, Sumatra).</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_422">An abstract of the annals of the Y=C3=BCan shi is contained in the first ten chapters of the <span class=3D"csc">Y=C3=BCan shi lei pien</span> (an abbreviated History of the Mongols) which were translated by Gaubil in his Histoire de Gentchiscan (see above p. 133, note 11).

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_423">The <span class=3D"csc">Y=C3=BCan ch=E2=80=98ao pi shi</span>, Secret History of the Mongol dynasty, is a Chinese translation of a Mongol work, which was completed before 1240. It contains the early history of the Mongols, the reign of Chingiz, and part of the reign of Ogotai; and it was translated into Chinese in the early period of the Ming dynasty. An abridgment of this work was translated into Russian by Palladius, and published in 1866 in the Records of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission at Peking, vol. 4. It was only six years later that Palladius found that the work was extant in a fuller form. Bretschneider says: This document =E2=80=9Ccorroborates generally Rashid-eddin=E2=80=99s records, and occasionally we find passages in it which sound like a literal translation of the statements of the Persian historiographer. This proves that Rashid had made use of the same source of information as the unknown author of the Y=C3=BCan ch=E2=80=98ao pi shi. As to the dates in the latter work, they are generally in accordance with the dates given by the Mohammadan authors; but in a few cases the Y=C3=BCan ch=E2=80=98ao pi shi commits great chronological blunders and misplacements of events, as, for instance, with respect to the war in the west.=E2=80=9D</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_424">In his work cited above Bretschneider has rendered accessible other Chinese documents bearing on Mongol history, especially some relations of Chinese travellers and envoys; for example, an extract (i. p. 9 <i>sqq.</i>) from the Si Yu Lu (Description of Journey to the West) of Ye-l=C3=BC Ch=E2=80=99u ts=E2=80=98ai, a minister of Chingiz who attended him to Persia, 1219-24. (There is a biography of this Ye-l=C3=BC in the Y=C3=BCan Shi.) Bretschneider makes valuable contributions to the difficult subject of geographical identifications, and discusses among other documents the account of the Armenian prince Haithon=E2=80=99s visit to Mongolia, written by Guiragos Gandsaketsi. This Haithon I. must not be confounded with Haithon, the monk of Pr=C3=A9montr=C3=A9, mentioned by Gibbon (above p. 133, note 13). The account of Guiragos was translated into French by Klaproth (Nouv. Journ. Asiat., p. 273 <i>sqq.</i>, 1833) from a Russian <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>331<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> version by Argutinski; but the history of Guiragos has since been translated by Brosset.</p>

It was thus written after the Manchus had conquered China and overthrown the Mongols. The earlier part of the book is practically a history of Tibet. The account of the origin of the Mongols is translated from Chinese sources. The author is a zealous Buddhist and dwells at great length on all that concerned the interests of his religion; other matters are often dismissed far too briefly. The relation of the career of Chingiz is marked by many anachronisms and inaccuracies. The work was made accessible by the German translation of I. J.

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_429">If Gibbon had been more fully acquainted with the history of the family of the Acciajoli, he would have probably devoted some pages to the rise of their fortunes. They rose to such power and influence in Greece in the 14th century that the subjoined account, taken from Finlay (vol. iv. p. 157 <i>sqq.</i>) =E2=80=94 with a few additions in square brackets =E2=80=94 will not be out of place.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_430">=E2=80=9CSeveral members of the family of Acciajoli, which formed a distinguished commercial company at Florence in the thirteenth century, settled in the Peloponnesus about the middle of the fourteenth, under the protection of Robert, king of Naples. Nicholas Acciajoli was invested, in the year 334, with the administration of the lands which the company had acquired in payment or in security of the loans it had made to the royal House of Anjou; and he acquired additional possessions in the principality of Achaia, both by purchase and grant, from Catherine of Valois, titular empress of Romania and regent of Achaia for her son prince Robert. [It is disputed whether he was her lover.] The encroachments of the mercantile spirit on the feudal system are displayed in the concessions obtained by Nicholas Acciajoli in the grants he received from Catherine of Valois. He was invested with the power of mortgaging, exchanging, and selling his fiefs, without any previous authorisation from his suzerain. Nicholas acted as principal minister of Catherine during a residence of three years in the Morea; and he made use of his position, like a prudent banker, to obtain considerable grants of territory. He returned to Italy in 1341 and never again visited Greece; but his estates in Achaia were administered by his relations and other members of the banking house at Florence, many of whom obtained considerable fiefs for themselves through his influence.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_431">=E2=80=9CNicholas Acciajoli was appointed hereditary grand seneschal of the kingdom of Naples by Queen Jeanne, whom he accompanied in her flight to Provence when she was driven from her kingdom by Louis of Hungary. <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>332<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> On her return he received the rich country of Amalfi, as a reward for his fidelity, and subsequently Malta was added to his possessions. He was an able statesman and a keen political intriguer; and he was almost the first example of the superior position the purse of the moneyed citizen was destined to assume over the sword of the feudal baron and the learning of the politic churchman. Nicholas Acciajoli was the first of that banking aristocracy which has since held an important position in European history. He was the type of a class destined at times to decide the fate of kingdoms and at times to arrest the progress of armies. He certainly deserved to have his life written by a man of genius, but his superciliousness and assumption of princely state, even in his intercourse with the friends of his youth, disgusted Boccaccio, who alone of Florentine contemporaries could have left a vivid sketch of the career which raised him from the partner of a banking-house to the rank of a great feudal baron and to live in the companionship of kings. Boccaccio, offended by his insolence, seems not to have appreciated his true importance as the type of a coming age and a new state of society; and the indignant and satirical record he has left of the pride and presumption of the mercantile noble is by no means a correct portrait of the Neapolitan minister. Yet even Boccaccio records in his usual truthful manner that Nicholas had dispersed powerful armies, though he unjustly depreciates the merit of the success, because the victory was gained by combinations effected by gold, and not by the headlong charge of a line of lances. [Boccaccio dedicated his <i>Donne illustri</i> to Niccolo=E2=80=99s sister Andrea, the countess of Monte Oderisio.]</p>

He died in 1365;<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bury-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-11#lf0214-11_footnote_nt_648" id=3D"lf0214-11_footnote_nt_648_ref" class=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">1</a> and his sons Angelo and Robert succeeded in turn to the barony and government of Corinth. Angelo mortgaged Corinth to his relative [second cousin], Nerio Acciajoli, who already possessed fiefs in Acbaia, and who took up his residence at Corinth on account of the political and military importance of the fortress as well as to enable him to administer the revenues of the barony in the most profitable manner.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_433">=E2=80=9CNerio Acciajoli, though he held the governorship of Corinth only as the deputy of his relation, and the barony only in security of a debt, was nevertheless, from his ability, enterprising character, great wealth, and extensive connections, one of the most influential barons of Achaia; and, from the disorderly state of the principality he was enabled to act as an independent prince.=E2=80=9D</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_434">=E2=80=9CThe Catalans were the constant rivals of the Franks of Achaia, and Nerio Acciajoli, as governor of Corinth, was the guardian of the principality against their hostile projects.

The mother of the bride was a Greek lady; she betrothed her daughter to Simeon [Stephen Ducas], son of the prince of Vallachian Thessaly; and the Catalans, with the two Laurias at their head, supported this arrangement. But the barons of Achaia, headed by Nerio Acciajoli, pretended that the Prince of Achaia as feudal suzerain of Athens was entitled to dispose of the hand of the countess.

Under Antonio =E2=80=9CAthens enjoyed uninterrupted tranquillity for forty years. The republic of Florence deemed it an object worthy of its especial attention to obtain a commercial treaty with the duchy, for the purpose of securing to the citizens of the republic all the privileges enjoyed by the Venetians, Catalans, and Genoese.=E2=80=9D The conclusion of this treaty is almost the only event recorded concerning the external relations of Athens during the long reign of Antonio. The Athenians appear to have lived happily under his government; and he himself seems to have spent his time in a joyous manner, inviting his Florentine relations to Greece, and entertaining them with festivals and hunting parties. Yet he was neither a spendthrift nor a tyrant; for Chalcocondylas, whose father lived at his court, records that, while he accumulated great wealth with prudent economy, he at the same time adorned the city of Athens with many new buildings. He died in 1435, and was succeeded by Nerio II., grandson of Donato, the brother of Nerio I.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_438">The facts about the history of the Greek islands during the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries were enveloped in obscurity, and fictions and false hypotheses were current, until the industry of Professor C.

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_440">It is only recently that European history has begun to understand that the successes of the Mongol army which overran Poland and occupied Hungary in the spring of <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 1241 were won by consummate strategy and were not due to a mere overwhelming superiority of numbers. But this fact has not yet become a matter of common knowledge; the vulgar opinion which represents the Tartars as a wild horde carrying all before them solely by their multitude, and galloping through Eastern Europe without a strategic plan, rushing at all obstacles and overcoming them by mere weight, still prevails. It will therefore not be amiss to explain very briefly the plan and execution of the Mongol campaign. The nominal commander-in-chief was Batu, but there is no doubt that the management of the expedition was in the hands of Subutai.</p>

<span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>337<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_441">The objective of Subutai was Hungary, =E2=80=94 the occupation of Hungary and the capture of Gran (Strigonium), which was then not only the ecclesiastical capital but the most important town in the country. In advancing on Hungary, his right flank was exposed to an attack from the princes of Poland, behind whom were the forces of Bohemia and North Germany. To meet this danger, Subutai divided his host into two parts, which we may call the northern and the southern army. The duty of the northern army was to sweep over Poland, advance to Bohemia, and effectually prevent the princes of the north from interfering with the operations of the southern army in Hungary. Thus strategically the invasion of Poland was subsidiary to the invasion of Hungary, and the northern army, when its work was done, was to meet the southern or main army on the Danube.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_442">The northern army advanced in three divisions. The main force under Baidar marched through the dominions of Boleslaw the Chaste, and took Cracow; then bearing north-westward it reached Oppeln on the Oder, where it defeated Prince Mieczyslaw; and descended the Oder to Breslau. At the same time Kaidu advanced by a more northerly route through the land of Conrad, prince of Mosovia and Cujavia; while on the extreme right a force under Ordu terrified the Lithuanians and Prussians and crossed the Lower Vistula. The three divisions reunited punctually at Breslau, the capital of Henry II. of Lower Silesia; and all took part in the battle of Liegnitz (April 9), for which King Wenzel of Bohemia arrived too late. Just one day too late: the Mongol generals had skilfully managed to force Prince Henry to fight before his arrival. Wenzel discreetly withdrew beyond the mountains into Bohemia; all he could hope to do was to defend his own kingdom. Saxony now lived in dread that its turn had come. But it was no part of the plan of Subutai to launch his troops into Northern Germany. They had annihilated the forces of Poland; it was now time for them to approach the main army in Hungary. The Mongols therefore turned their back upon the north, and marched through Upper Silesia and Moravia, capturing town after town as they went. Upon Wenzel who watched them with a large army, expecting them to invade Bohemia, they played a trick. He was posted near the defile of Glatz and the Mongols were at Ottmachau. They were too wary to attack him in such a position; it was necessary to remove him. Accordingly they marched back as if they purposed to invade Bohemia by the pass of the K=C3=B6nigstein in the north. Wenzel marched to the threatened point; and when the Mongols saw him safely there, they rapidly retraced their steps and reached Moravia (end of April, beginning of May).</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_443">Meanwhile the main army advanced into Hungary in three columns converging on the Upper Theiss. The right wing was led by Shaiban, a younger brother of Batu, and seems to have advanced on the Porta Hungariae =E2=80=94 the north-western entrance to Hungary, in the Little Carpathians. The central column under Subutai himself, with Batu, marched on the Porta Rusciae, the defile which leads from Galicia into the valley of the Theiss. The left column, under Kadan and Buri, moved through Transylvania towards the K=C3=B6r=C3=B6s.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_444">The Porta Rusciae was carried, its defenders annihilated, on March 15; and a flying column of Tartars shot across Hungary, in advance of the main army. On March 15 they were half a day=E2=80=99s journey from Pest, having ridden about 180 miles in less than three days. On the 17th they fought and defeated an Hungarian force, and on the same day Shaiban=E2=80=99s right column captured Waitzen, a fort near the angle where the Danube bends southward. The object of Subutai in sending the advance squadron Pestward <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>338<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> was doubtless to multiply difficulties for the Hungarians in organising their preparations. These preparations were already hampered by the conflicts and jealousies between the king and his nobles; and then towards the end of March befell the murder of Kutan, the chief of the Cumans, and the consequent revolt of the Cumans, =E2=80=94 mentioned by Gibbon, =E2=80=94 which demolished the defence of Eastern Hungary. Meanwhile Kadan=E2=80=99s left column had advanced through Transylvania and passed the K=C3=B6r=C3=B6s and Theiss; in the first days of April it advanced to the Danube, in the neighbourhood of Pest. Subutai had in the meantime arrived himself with the main central column, and the three columns of the central army were now together in position on the left bank of the Danube from Waitzen to Pest. But the Hungarian army with its German allies and Slavonic contingents had united at Pest, about 100,000 strong; and it was impossible for the Mongols to cross in the face of such a host. Accordingly Subutai began a retreat, drawing the enemy after him. He retired behind the Saj=C3=B3, not far from the confluence of that river with the Theiss, =E2=80=94 a central position on the route from Pest to Galicia, where he was in touch with his own base of operations near Unghvar and the Porta Rusciae. The Hungarians took up their position on the opposite bank in the plain of Mohi. By skilful tactics the Mongols surrounded their camp and cut them to pieces on April 11, two days after the northern army had gained the battle of Liegnitz.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_445">It was wonderful how punctually and effectually the arrangements of the commander were carried out in operations extending from the Lower Vistula to Transylvania. Such a campaign was quite beyond the power of any European army of the time; and it was beyond the vision of any European commander. There was no general in Europe, from Frederick II. downward, who was not a tiro in strategy compared to Subutai. It should also be noticed that the Mongols embarked upon the enterprise, with full knowledge of the political situation of Hungary and the condition of Poland; they had taken care to inform themselves by a well-organised system of spies: on the other hand, the Hungarians and Christian powers, like childish Barbarians, knew hardly anything about their enemies.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-11_446">The foregoing summary is founded on the excellent study of G. Strakosch-Grassmann, Der Einfall der Mongolen, in Mitteleuropa in den Jahren 1241 und 1242, 1893, and the vivid account of L. Cahun, in his Introduction =C3=A0 l=E2=80=99Histoire de l=E2=80=99Asie, p. 352 <i>sqq.</i> The chief defect in Strakosch-Grassmann=E2=80=99s book is that he does not give to Subutai his proper place. The important Chinese biography of Subutai is translated in the first vol. of Bretschneider=E2=80=99s Medi=C3=A6val Researches from Eastern Asiatic Sources, 1888. All the western authorities have been carefully studied and analysed by Strakosch-Grassmann. (The account of the Mongol campaigns in K=C3=B6hler=E2=80=99s Die Entwicklung des Kriegswesens und der Kriegf=C3=BChrung in der Ritterzeit, vol. 3, pt. 3, 1889, may also be compared.)</p>

Servia was the strongest power in the peninsula under Stephen (1331-1355), and its boundaries extended from the Danube to the gulf of Arta. =E2=80=9CHe was a man of great ambition and was celebrated for his gigantic stature and personal courage. His subjects boasted of his liberality and success in war; his enemies reproached him with faithlessness and cruelty. He had driven his father Stephen VII. [Urosh III.] from the throne, and the old man had been murdered in prison by the rebellious nobles of Servia, who feared lest a reconciliation should take place with his son. Stephen Dushan passed seven years of his youth at Constantinople, where he became acquainted with all the defects of the Byzantine government and with all the vices of Greek society. The circumstances in which the rival Emperors were placed during the year 1345 were extremely favourable to his ambitious projects, and he seized the opportunity to extend his conquests in every direction. To the east he rendered himself master of the whole valley of the Strymon, took the large and flourishing city of Serres and garrisoned all the fortresses as far as the wall that defended the pass of Christopolis. He extended his dominions along the shores of the Adriatic, and to the south he carried his arms to the gulf of Ambracia. He subdued the Vallachians of Thessaly, and placed strong garrisons in Achrida, Kastoria and Joannina. Flushed with victory he at last formed the ambitious scheme of depriving the Greeks of their political and ecclesiastical supremacy in the Eastern Empire and transferring them to the Servians=E2=80=9D (Finlay, iv. p. 441-2). In 1346 he was crowned at Skopia as =E2=80=9CTsar of the Serbs and Greeks,=E2=80=9D and gave his son the title of Kral; and he raised his archbishop to the rank of Patriarch. The prosperity of his reign is better shown by the growth of trade in the Servian towns than by the increase of Servian territory. Moreover Stephen did for Servia what Yaroslav did for Russia; he drew up a code of laws, which might be quoted to modify Gibbon=E2=80=99s contemptuous references to the Servians as barbarians. This Zakonik has been repeatedly edited by Shafarik, Miklosich, Novakovich, and Zigel.]</p></div>

The direct intercourse by land, even between Constantinople and Thessalonica, by the Egnatian Way, was interrupted, for the Servian Emperor possessed Amphipolis, and all the country about the mouth of the Strymon from Philippi to the lake Bolbe. The nucleus of the imperial power consisted of the city of Constantinople and the greater part of Thrace. On the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus, the Greek possessions were confined to the suburb of Skutari, a few forts and a narrow strip of coast extending from Chalcedon to the Black Sea. In Thrace the frontier extended from Sozopolis along the mountains to the south-west, passing about a day=E2=80=99s journey to the north of Adrianople, and descending to the Aegean Sea at the pass and fortress of Christopolis. It included the districts of Morrah and the Thracian Chalkidike [of which Gratianopolis was the chief town]. The second portion of the Empire in importance consisted of the rich and populous city of Thessalonica, with the western part of the Macedonian Chalkidike and its three peninsulas of Cassandra, Longos and Agionoros [=E1=BC=8D=CE=B3=CE=B9=CE=BF=CE=BD =E1=BD=8C=CF=81=CE=BF=CF=82]. By land it was entirely enclosed in the Servian empire. The third detached portion of the empire consisted of a part of Vallachian Thessaly and of Albanian Epirus, which formed a small imperial province interposed between the Servian empire and the Catalan duchy of Athens and Neopatras. The fourth consisted of the Greek province in the Peloponnesus, which obtained the name of the Despotat of Misithra, and embraced about one third of the peninsula. Cantacuzenos conferred the government on his second son, Manuel, who preserved his place by force of arms after his father was driven from the throne. The remaining fragments of the empire consisted of a few islands in the Aegean Sea which had escaped the domination of the Venetians, the Genoese, and the Knights of St. John; and of the cities of Philadelphia and Phocaea, which still recognised the suzerainty of Constantinople, though surrounded by the territories of the emirs of Aidin and Saroukhan.

The author is guilty of strange blunders in Oriental History; but he was conversant with the language, the annals, and institutions of the Turks. Cantemir partly draws his materials from the Synopsis of Saadi Effendi of Larissa, dedicated in the year 1696 to Sultan Mustapha, and a valuable abridgment of the original historians. In one of the Ramblers, Dr. Johnson praises Knolles (a General History of the Turks to the present year, London, 1603), as the first of historians, unhappy only in the choice of his subject. Yet I much doubt whether a partial and verbose compilation from Latin writers, thirteen hundred folio pages of speeches and battles, can either instruct or amuse an enlightened age, which requires from the historian some tincture of philosophy and criticism.

This emboldened the other Slavs of the Balkan peninsula. Shishman of Bulgaria revolted, and this led to the direct incorporation of Bulgaria in the Ottoman empire. The Servian Kral, who was the leader of the Slavs in their struggle to maintain their independence, took the field at the head of a federate army in spring 1389. He was supported by the King of Bosnia, the princes of Croatia, Albania, and Chlum (afterwards Herzegovina) and Walachia; and there were some Bulgarians (who had escaped the wreck of their country) and Hungarian auxiliaries in his army. The battle was fought, 15th June, on the Kosovo-polje or Amselfeld (blackbird field) on the banks of the Lab, west of Pristina. The name of the Servian who stabbed Murad was Milosh Obili=C4=87 (or Kobilovi=C4=87).

He has not realised, or brought out, the fact that the greatest result of Timur=E2=80=99s empire was the victory of Islam in Central Asia. Timur acted from the beginning in close co-operation with the Musulman ecclesiastics of Transoxiana, and when he won supreme power, he did away with the Mongol and Turkish legislative system of Chingiz and substituted the law of Islam. In regard to the very foundations of the political constitution there is a vast difference between the two systems. Chingiz and his successors were subject to the law (the Y=C4=81s=C4=81k) and bound by its provisions; whereas according to the principles of Islam the head of the state is not bound by the law, but is responsible only to God. Thus the will of the sovereign is set above the law. Timur then broke completely with the Mongol tradition, such as it had been developed under Chinese influence, and drew the Turks of Central Asia out of touch with the far East. As the Mongol power in China was overthrown about the same time by the revolution which set the Ming dynasty on the throne (<span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 1370), this period marks a general decline of Mongol influence in Asia.]</p></div>

Such was the vulgar pronunciation which the stern Gardiner maintained by penal statutes in the University of Cambridge; but the monosyllable =CE=B2=CE=B7 represented to an Attic ear the bleating of sheep; and a bell-wether is better evidence than a bishop or a chancellor. The treatises of those scholars, particularly Erasmus, who asserted a more classical pronunciation, are collected in the Sylloge of Havercamp (2 vols. in octavo, Lugd.
