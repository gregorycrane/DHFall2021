# Developing a digital edition of Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire

One goal of our class is to make concrete progress towards a new, and truly digital, edition of Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. A number of digitized versions of the Decline and Fall are already available in multiple formats:

<ul> 
<li><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25717/25717-h/25717-h.htm">Project Gutenberg</a> has a transcription of the 1845 edition by Rev. Henry Hart Milman (1791-1868).
<li><a href="https://www.ccel.org/g/gibbon/decline/index.htm">Christian Classics Ethereal Library</a> [not immediately obvious which version this is from]
<ul>
<li>This contains transcriptions of the marginalia that we should be able to aign with a transcription that does not have them.
<li>This also contains the dates in the text which are not in the edition that the OLL uses.
</ul>
<li><a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/lecky-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-12-vols">Library of Liberty</a>: a transcription of a 12-volume version of the Bury edition published in New York by Fred de Fau and Company. A 7-volume version of the Bury edition sees to be more common.
<ul>
<li>Good transcriptions of accented Greek from the notes.
<li>The HTML formatting is not readily available. The OLL declares the text to be public domain, so we extracted the unformatted transcription. We can, with minimal manual work, realign the notes to the note markers in the text. 
<li>This also contains the notes added by Bury but these can separated out insofar as they are consistently set aside in square brackets.
</ul>
<li>ECCO TCP (only the first six of twelve volumes in the 1792 edition)
</ul>
