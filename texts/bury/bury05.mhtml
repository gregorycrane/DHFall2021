, before he had accomplished the twentieth year of his age, was equal to th=
at of the most celebrated princes. His gentle and amiable disposition endea=
red him to his private friends, the graceful affability of his manners enga=
ged the affection of the people: the men of letters, who enjoyed the libera=
lity, acknowledged the taste and eloquence, of their sovereign; his valour =
and dexterity in arms were equally applauded by the soldiers; and the clerg=
y considered the humble piety of Gratian as the first and most useful of hi=
s virtues. The victory of Colmar had delivered the West from a formidable i=
nvasion; and the grateful provinces of the East ascribed the merits of Theo=
dosius to the author of <i>his</i> greatness and of the public safety. Grat=
ian survived those memorable events only four or five years; but he survive=
d his reputation; and, before he fell a victim to rebellion, he had lost, i=

on of Valentinian from his infancy; nor to the headstrong passions which th=
at gentle youth appears to have escaped. A more attentive view of the life =
of Gratian may perhaps suggest the true cause of the disappointment of the =
public hopes. His apparent virtues, instead of being the hardy productions =
of experience and adversity, were the premature and artificial fruits of a =
royal education. The anxious tenderness of his father was continually emplo=
yed to bestow on him those advantages which he might perhaps esteem the mor=
e highly, as he himself had been deprived of them; and the most skilful mas=
ters of every science and of every art had laboured to form the mind and bo=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_225">The behaviour of Gratian, which degraded his c=
haracter in the eyes of mankind, could not have disturbed the security of h=
is reign, if the army had not been provoked to resent their peculiar injuri=
es. As long as the young emperor was guided by the instructions of his mast=
ers, he professed himself the friend and pupil of the soldiers; many of his=
 hours were spent in the familiar conversation of the camp; and the health,=
 the comforts, the rewards, the honours, of his faithful troops appeared to=
 be the object of his attentive concern. But, after Gratian more freely ind=
ulged his prevailing taste for hunting and shooting, he naturally connected=
 himself with the most dexterous ministers of his favourite amusement. A bo=
dy of the Alani was received into the military and domestic service of the =
palace; and the admirable skill which they were accustomed to display in th=
e unbounded plains of Scythia was exercised, on a more narrow theatre, in t=
he parks and enclosures of Gaul. Gratian admired the talents and customs of=
 these favourite guards, to whom alone he entrusted the defence of his pers=
on; and as if he meant to insult the public opinion, he frequently shewed h=
imself to the soldiers and people, with the dress and arms, the long bow, t=
he sounding quiver, and the fur garments of a Scythian warrior. The unworth=
y spectacle of a Roman prince who had renounced the dress and manners of hi=
s country filled the minds of the legions with grief and indignation.<a hre=

 in the space of a few years, had wandered from the banks of the Volga to t=

s and garrisons of the West; and, as the mild indolence of Gratian neglecte=
d to extinguish the first symptoms of discontent, the want of love and resp=
ect was not supplied by the influence of fear. But the subversion of an est=
ablished government is always a work of some real, and of much apparent, di=

rch to the relief of his benefactor, before he received the intelligence of=
 his defeat and death. During the season of sincere grief, or ostentatious =
mourning, the Eastern emperor was interrupted by the arrival of the princip=
al chamberlain of Maximus; and the choice of a venerable old man, for an <s=

fice which was usually exercised by eunuchs, announced to the court of Cons=
tantinople the gravity and temperance of the British usurper. The ambassado=
r condescended to justify, or excuse, the conduct of his master, and to pro=
test in specious language that the murder of Gratian had been perpetrated, =
without his knowledge or consent, by the precipitate zeal of the soldiers. =
But he proceeded, in a firm and equal tone, to offer Theodosius the alterna=
tive of peace or war. The speech of the ambassador concluded with a spirite=
d declaration that, although Maximus, as a Roman and as the father of his p=
eople, would choose rather to employ his forces in the common defence of th=
e republic, he was armed and prepared, if his friendship should be rejected=
, to dispute in a field of battle the empire of the world. An immediate and=
 peremptory answer was required; but it was extremely difficult for Theodos=
ius to satisfy, on this important occasion, either the feelings of his own =
mind or the expectations of the public. The imperious voice of honour and g=
ratitude called aloud for revenge. From the liberality of Gratian he had re=
ceived the Imperial diadem: his patience would encourage the odious suspici=
on that he was more deeply sensible of former injuries than of recent oblig=
ations; and, if he accepted the friendship, he must seem to share the guilt=
, of the assassin. Even the principles of justice and the interest of socie=
ty would receive a fatal blow from the impunity of Maximus; and the example=
 of successful usurpation would tend to dissolve the artificial fabric of g=
overnment, and once more to replunge the empire in the crimes and calamitie=
s of the preceding age. But, as the sentiments of gratitude and honour shou=
ld invariably regulate the conduct of an individual, they may be overbalanc=
ed in the mind of a sovereign by the sense of superior duties; and the maxi=
ms both of justice and humanity must permit the escape of an atrocious crim=
inal, if an innocent people would be involved in the consequences of his pu=
nishment. The assassin of Gratian had usurped, but he actually possessed, t=
he most warlike provinces of the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decorati=

to be apprehended that, after the vital strength of the republic had been w=
asted in a doubtful and destructive contest, the feeble conqueror would rem=
ain an easy prey to the Barbarians of the North. These weighty consideratio=
ns engaged Theodosius to dissemble his resentment and to accept the allianc=
e of the tyrant. But he stipulated that Maximus should content himself with=
 the possession of the countries beyond the Alps. The brother of Gratian wa=

had been exerted by the orthodox party under the reigns of Constantius and =
Valens. The moral character and conduct of the hostile sects appear to have=
 been governed by the same common principles of nature and religion; but a =
very material circumstance may be discovered, which tended to distinguish t=
he degrees of their theological faith. Both parties in the schools, as well=
 as in the temples, acknowledged and worshipped the divine majesty of Chris=
t; and, as we are always prone to impute our own sentiments and passions to=
 the Deity, it would be deemed more prudent and respectful to exaggerate, t=

le of Athanasius exulted in the proud confidence that he had entitled himse=
lf to the divine favour; while the follower of Arius must have been torment=
ed by the secret apprehension that he was guilty, perhaps, of an unpardonab=
le offence, by the scanty praise, and parsimonious honours, which he bestow=
ed on the Judge of the World. The opinions of Arianism might satisfy a cold=
 and speculative mind; but the doctrine of the Nicene Creed, most powerfull=

to become popular and successful in a believing age.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_231">The hope that truth and wisdom would be found =

ider them as the illegal productions either of fraud or forgery. The penal =
statutes were directed against the ministers, the assemblies, and the perso=

f they presumed to preach the doctrine, or to practise the rites, of their =

pposed that the error of the heretics could proceed only from the obstinate=
 temper of their minds; and that such a temper was a fit object of censure =
and punishment. The anathemas of the church were fortified by a sort of civ=

istianity, temporal as well as spiritual, were confined to the true believe=
rs; and the mind of Ambrose was satisfied that his own theological opinions=
 were the standard of truth and orthodoxy. The archbishop, who refused to h=
old any conference or negotiation with the instruments of Satan, declared, =
with modest firmness, his resolution to die a martyr rather than to yield t=
o the impious sacrilege; and Justina, who resented the refusal as an act of=
 insolence and rebellion, hastily determined to exert the Imperial prerogat=
ive of her son. As she desired to perform her public devotions on the appro=
aching festival of Easter, Ambrose was ordered to appear before the council=
. He obeyed the summons with the respect of a faithful subject, but he was =
followed, without his consent, by an innumerable people: they pressed, with=
 impetuous zeal, against the gates of the palace; and the affrighted minist=
ers of Valentinian, instead of pronouncing a sentence of exile on the archb=
ishop of Milan, humbly requested that he would interpose his authority, to =
protect the person of the emperor and to restore the tranquillity of the ca=
pital. But the promises which Ambrose received and communicated were soon v=
iolated by a perfidious court, and during six of the most solemn days which=
 Christian piety has set apart for the exercise of religion the city was ag=
itated by the irregular convulsions of tumult and fanaticism. The officers =
of the household were directed to prepare, first the Porcian, and afterward=
s the new <i>Basilica,</i> for the immediate reception of the emperor and h=
is mother. The splendid canopy and hangings of the royal seat were arranged=
 in the customary manner; but it was found necessary to defend them, by a s=
trong guard, from the insults of the populace. The Arian ecclesiastics who =
ventured to shew themselves in the streets were exposed to the most imminen=

scuing his personal enemies from the hands of the enraged multitude.</p>

 the mother of the emperor; and her desire to obtain a church for the Arian=
s was compared to the most cruel persecutions which Christianity had endure=
d under the reign of Paganism. The measures of the court served only to exp=
ose the magnitude of the evil. A fine of two hundred pounds of gold was imp=
osed on the corporate body of merchants and manufacturers: an order was sig=
nified, in the name of the emperor, to all the officers, and inferior serva=
nts, of the courts of justice, that, during the continuance of the public d=
isorders, they should strictly confine themselves to their houses: and the =
ministers of Valentinian imprudently confessed that the most respectable pa=
rt of the citizens of Milan was attached to the cause of their archbishop. =
He was again solicited to restore peace to his country, by a timely complia=
nce with the will of his sovereign. The reply of Ambrose was couched in the=
 most humble and respectful terms, which might, however, be interpreted as =
a serious declaration of civil war. =E2=80=9CHis life and fortune were in t=

 wished to die in the presence of his faithful flock, and at the foot of th=

e the house of God that they had implored the hospitable protection of the =
republic? The suspense of the Barbarians allowed some hours for a more effe=
ctual negotiation; and the empress was persuaded, by the advice of her wise=
st counsellors, to leave the Catholics in possession of all the churches of=
 Milan; and to dissemble, till a more convenient season, her intentions of =
revenge. The mother of Valentinian could never forgive the triumph of Ambro=

as softened by the tears of beauty; his affections were insensibly engaged =
by the graces of youth and innocence; the art of Justina managed and direct=
ed the impulse of passion; and the celebration of the royal nuptials was th=
e assurance and signal of the civil war. The unfeeling critics, who conside=
r every amorous weakness as an indelible stain on the memory of a great and=
 orthodox emperor, are inclined, on this occasion, to dispute the suspiciou=
s evidence of the historian Zosimus. For my own part, I shall frankly confe=
ss that I am willing to find, or even to seek, in the revolutions of the wo=
rld some traces of the mild and tender sentiments of domestic life; and, am=
idst the crowd of fierce and ambitious conquerors, I can distinguish, with =
peculiar complacency, a gentle hero, who may be supposed to receive his arm=
our from the hands of love. The alliance of the Persian king was secured by=
 the faith of treaties; the martial Barbarians were persuaded to follow the=
 standard, or to respect the frontiers, of an active and liberal monarch; a=
nd the dominions of Theodosius, from the Euphrates to the Hadriatic, resoun=
ded with the preparations of war both by land and sea. The skilful disposit=
ion of the forces of the East seemed to multiply their numbers, and distrac=
ted the attention of Maximus. He had reason to fear that a chosen body of t=
roops, under the command of the intrepid Arbogastes, would direct their mar=
ch along the banks of the Danube and boldly penetrate through the Rh=C3=A6t=
ian provinces into the centre of Gaul. A powerful fleet was equipped in the=
 harbours of Greece and Epirus, with an apparent design that, as soon as a =
passage had <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current;=
 Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>41<span class=3D"bracket">]</=
span></span> been opened by a naval victory, Valentinian and his mother sho=
uld land in Italy, proceed, without delay, to Rome, and occupy the majestic=
 seat of religion and empire. In the meanwhile, Theodosius himself advanced=
 at the head of a brave and disciplined army, to encounter his unworthy riv=
al, who, after the siege of =C3=86mona, had fixed his camp in the neighbour=
hood of Siscia, a city of Pannonia, strongly fortified by the broad and rap=
id stream of the Save.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_241">The veterans, who still remembered the long re=
sistance and successive resources of the tyrant Magnentius, might prepare t=
hemselves for the labours of three bloody campaigns. But the contest with h=

 decided in the term of two months<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/ti=

The superior genius of the emperor of the East might prevail over the feebl=
e Maximus; who, in this important crisis, shewed himself destitute of milit=
ary skill or personal courage; but the abilities of Theodosius were seconde=
d by the advantage which he possessed of a numerous and active cavalry. The=
 Huns, the Alani, and, after their example, the Goths themselves, were form=
ed into squadrons of archers; who fought on horseback and confounded the st=
eady valour of the Gauls and Germans by the rapid motions of a Tartar war. =
After the fatigue of a long march, in the heat of summer, they spurred thei=
r foaming horses into the waters of the Save, swam the river in the presenc=
e of the enemy, and instantly charged and routed the troops who guarded the=
 high ground on the opposite side. Marcellinus, the tyrant=E2=80=99s brothe=
r, advanced to support them with the select cohorts which were considered a=
s the hope and strength of the army. The action, which had been interrupted=
 by the approach of night, was renewed in the morning; and, after a sharp c=
onflict, the surviving remnant of the bravest soldiers of Maximus threw dow=
n their arms at the feet of the conqueror. Without suspending his march to =
receive the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current;=
 Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>42<span class=3D"bracket">]</=
span></span> loyal acclamations of the citizens of =C3=86mona, Theodosius p=
ressed forwards, to terminate the war by the death or captivity of his riva=
l, who fled before him with the diligence of fear. From the summit of the J=
ulian Alps, he descended with such incredible speed into the plain of Italy=
 that he reached Aquileia on the evening of the first day; and Maximus, who=
 found himself encompassed on all sides, had scarcely time to shut the gate=
s of the city. But the gates could not long resist the effort of a victorio=
us enemy; and the despair, the disaffection, the indifference of the soldie=
rs and people, hastened the downfall of the wretched Maximus. He was dragge=
d from his throne, rudely stripped of the Imperial ornaments, the robe, the=
 diadem, and the purple slippers; and conducted, like a malefactor, to the =
camp and presence of Theodosius, at a place about three miles from Aquileia=
. The behaviour of the emperor was not intended to insult, and he shewed so=
me disposition to pity and forgive, the tyrant of the West, who had never b=
een his personal enemy and was now become the object of his contempt. Our s=
ympathy is the most forcibly excited by the misfortunes to which we are exp=
osed; and the spectacle of a proud competitor, now prostrate at his feet, c=
ould not fail of producing very serious and solemn thoughts in the mind of =
the victorious emperor. But the feeble emotion of involuntary pity was chec=
ked by his regard for public justice and the memory of Gratian; and he aban=
doned the victim to the pious zeal of the soldiers, who drew him out of the=
 Imperial presence and instantly separated his head from his body. The inte=
lligence of his defeat and death was received with sincere, or well-dissemb=
led, joy: his son Victor, on whom he had conferred the title of Augustus, d=
ied by the order, perhaps by the hand, of the bold Arbogastes; and all the =
military plans of Theodosius were successfully executed. When he had thus t=
erminated the civil war with less difficulty and bloodshed than he might na=
turally expect, he employed the winter months of his residence at Milan to =
restore the state of the afflicted <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decora=

 ample panegyric. The wisdom of his laws, and the success of his arms, rend=
ered his administration respectable in the eyes both of his subjects and of=
 his enemies. He loved and practised the virtues of domestic life, which se=
ldom hold their residence in the palaces of kings. Theodosius was chaste an=
d temperate; he enjoyed, without excess, the sensual and social pleasures o=
f the table; and the warmth of his amorous passions was never diverted from=
 their lawful objects. The proud titles of Imperial greatness were adorned =
by the tender names of a faithful husband, an indulgent father; his uncle w=
as raised, by his affectionate esteem, to the rank of a second parent; Theo=
dosius embraced, as his own, the children of his brother and sister; and th=
e expressions of his regard were extended to the most distant and obscure b=
ranches of his numerous <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Editi=
on: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>44<span class=3D"=
bracket">]</span></span> kindred. His familiar friends were judiciously sel=
ected from among those persons who, in the equal intercourse of private lif=
e, had appeared before his eyes without a mask; the consciousness of person=
al and superior merit enabled him to despise the accidental distinction of =
the purple; and he proved by his conduct that he had forgotten all the inju=
ries, while he most gratefully remembered all the favours and services, whi=
ch he had received before he ascended the throne of the Roman empire. The s=
erious, or lively, tone of his conversation was adapted to the age, the ran=
k, or the character of his subjects whom he admitted into his society; and =
the affability of his manners displayed the image of his mind. Theodosius r=
espected the simplicity of the good and virtuous; every art, every talent, =
of an useful, or even of an innocent, nature was rewarded by his judicious =
liberality; and, except the heretics whom he persecuted with implacable hat=
red, the diffusive circle of his benevolence was circumscribed only by the =
limits of the human race. The government of a mighty empire may assuredly s=
uffice to occupy the time and the abilities of a mortal; yet the diligent p=
rince, without aspiring to the unsuitable reputation of profound learning, =
always reserved some moments of his leisure for the instructive amusement o=
f reading. History, which enlarged his experience, was his favourite study.=
 The annals of Rome, in the long period of eleven hundred years, presented =
him with a various and splendid picture of human life; and it has been part=
icularly observed that, whenever he perused the cruel acts of Cinna, of Mar=
ius, or of Sylla, he warmly expressed his generous detestation of those ene=
mies of humanity and freedom. His disinterested opinion of past events was =
usefully applied as the rule of his own actions; and Theodosius has deserve=
d the singular commendation that his virtues always seemed to expand with h=
is fortune; the season of his prosperity was that of his moderation; and hi=
s clemency appeared the most conspicuous after the danger and success of th=
e civil war. The Moorish <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edit=

rst heat of the victory; and a small number of the most obnoxious criminals=
 suffered the punishment of the law. But the emperor shewed himself much mo=
re attentive to relieve the innocent than to chastise the guilty. The oppre=
ssed subjects of the West, who would have deemed themselves happy in the re=
storation of their lands, were astonished to receive a sum of money equival=
ent to their losses; and the liberality of the conqueror supported the aged=
 mother, and educated the orphan daughters, of Maximus.<a href=3D"https://o=

hat the time of a prince is the property of his people, resigned himself to=
 the enjoyment of the innocent, but trifling, pleasures of a luxurious cour=

station where none could resist and few would dissuade the fatal consequenc=
e of his resentment, the humane monarch was justly alarmed by the conscious=
ness of his infirmity, and of his power. It was the constant study of his l=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_244">The lively impatience of the inhabitants of An=
tioch was never satisfied with their own situation, or with the character o=
r conduct of their successive sovereigns. The Arian subjects of Theodosius =
deplored the loss of their churches; and, as three rival bishops disputed t=

the murmurs of the two unsuccessful congregations. The exigencies of the Go=
thic war, and the inevitable expense that accompanied the conclusion of the=
 peace, had constrained the emperor to aggravate the weight of the public i=
mpositions; and the provinces of Asia, as they had not been involved in the=
 distress, were the less inclined to contribute to the relief, of Europe. T=

and angry invectives; and, from the subordinate powers of government, the i=

 itself on the images of the Imperial family, which were erected as objects=
 of public veneration in the most conspicuous places of the city. The statu=

em from his name, a Barbarian, had among his slaves a beautiful boy, who ex=
cited the impure desires of one of the charioteers of the Circus. The insol=
ent and brutal lover was thrown into prison by the order of Botheric; and h=

; and, as the strength of the garrison had been drawn away for the service =
of the Italian war, the feeble remnant, whose numbers were reduced by deser=
tion, could not save the unhappy general from their licentious fury. Bother=
ic, and several of his principal officers, were inhumanly murdered; their m=
angled bodies were dragged about the streets; and the emperor, who then res=

dge would have inflicted a severe punishment on the authors of the crime; a=
nd the merit of Botheric might contribute to exasperate the grief and indig=
nation of his master. The fiery and choleric temper of Theodosius was impat=

hat the blood of his lieutenant should be expiated by the blood of the guil=

expired with Theodosius; the last of the successors of Augustus and Constan=
tine, who appeared in the field at the head of their armies, and whose auth=
ority was universally acknowledged throughout the whole extent of the empir=
e. The memory of his virtues still continued, however, to protect the feebl=

 Arcadius and Honorius were saluted, by the unanimous consent of mankind, a=
s the lawful emperors of the East, and of the West; and the oath of fidelit=
y was eagerly taken by every order of the state; the senates of old and new=
 Rome, the clergy, the magistrates, the soldiers, and the people. Arcadius,=
 who then was about eighteen years of age, was born in Spain, in the humble=
 habitation of a private family. But he received a princely education in th=
e palace of Constantinople; and his inglorious life was spent in that peace=
ful and splendid seat of royalty, from whence he appeared to reign over the=
 provinces of Thrace, Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt, from the Lower Danube t=
o the confines of Persia and =C3=86thiopia. His younger brother, Honorius, =
assumed, in the eleventh year of his age, the nominal government of Italy, =
Africa, Gaul, Spain, and Britain; and the troops which guarded the frontier=
s of his kingdom were opposed, on one side, to the Caledonians, and on the =
other, to the Moors. The great and martial prefecture of Illyricum was divi=
ded between the two princes; the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decorati=

t the two large dioceses of Dacia and Macedonia, which Gratian had entruste=

st. The boundary in Europe was not very different from the line which now s=
eparates the Germans and the Turks; and the respective advantages of territ=
ory, riches, populousness, and military strength were fairly balanced and c=
ompensated in this final and permanent division of the Roman empire. The he=
reditary sceptre of the sons of Theodosius appeared to be the gift of natur=
e, and of their father; the generals and ministers had been accustomed to a=
dore the majesty of the royal infants; and the army and people were not adm=
onished of their rights and of their power by the dangerous example of a re=

us, and the repeated calamities of their reign, were not sufficient to obli=

several judges were named to share the guilt and reproach of injustice; but=
 the right of pronouncing sentence was reserved to the president alone, and=

 to accumulate those immense treasures which he could not spend without fol=

ervile fear. The fate of Lucian proclaimed to the East that the prefect who=
se industry was much abated in the despatch of ordinary business was active=
 and indefatigable in the pursuit of revenge. Lucian, the son of the prefec=
t Florentius, the oppressor of Gaul, and the enemy of Julian, had employed =
a considerable part of his inheritance, the fruit of rapine and corruption,=
 to purchase the friendship of Rufinus and the high office of Count of the =
East. But the new magistrate imprudently departed from the maxims of the co=
urt and of the times; disgraced his benefactor, by the contrast of a virtuo=
us and temperate administration; and presumed to refuse an act of injustice=
, which might have tended to the profit of the emperor=E2=80=99s uncle. Arc=
adius was easily persuaded to resent the supposed insult; and the prefect o=
f the East resolved to execute in person the cruel vengeance which he medit=
ated against this ungrateful delegate of his power. He performed with inces=
sant speed the journey of seven or eight hundred miles from Constantinople =
to Antioch, entered the capital of Syria at the dead of night, and spread u=
niversal consternation among a people ignorant of his design but not ignora=
nt of his character. The count of the fifteen provinces of the East was dra=
gged, like the vilest malefactor, before the arbitrary tribunal of Rufinus.=
 Notwithstanding the clearest evidence of his integrity, which was not impe=
ached even by the voice of an accuser, Lucian was condemned, almost without=
 a trial, to suffer a cruel and ignominious punishment. The ministers of th=
e tyrant, by the order, and in the presence, of their master, beat him on t=

he fainted under the violence of the pain, he was removed in a close litter=

ed China in a period of weakness and intestine discord; and these fortunate=
 Tartars, adopting the laws and manners of the vanquished people, founded a=
n Imperial dynasty, which reigned near one hundred and sixty years over the=
 northern provinces of the monarchy. Some generations before they ascended =

led the senate in the palace of the C=C3=A6sars; represented, in a studied =
oration, the actual state of affairs; proposed the demands of the Gothic ki=
ng, and submitted to their consideration the choice of peace or war. The se=
nators, as if they had been suddenly awakened from a dream of four hundred =
years, appeared on this important occasion to be inspired by the courage, r=
ather than by the wisdom, of their predecessors. They loudly declared, in r=
egular speeches, or in tumultuary acclamations, that it was unworthy of the=
 majesty of Rome to purchase a precarious and disgraceful truce from a Barb=
arian king; and that, in the judgment of a magnanimous people, the chance o=
f ruin was always preferable to the certainty of dishonour. The minister, w=
hose pacific intentions were seconded only by the voices of a few servile a=

or his own conduct, and even for the demands of the Gothic prince. =E2=80=

 Barbarian enemy. Alaric had faithfully asserted the just pretensions of th=
e republic to the provinces which were usurped by the Greeks of Constantino=
ple; he modestly required the fair and stipulated recompense of his service=
s; and, if he had desisted from the prosecution of his enterprise, he had o=
beyed, in his retreat, the peremptory though private letters of the emperor=
 himself. These contradictory orders (he would not dissemble the errors of =
his own family) had been procured by the intercession of Serena. The tender=
 piety of his wife had been too deeply affected by the discord of the royal=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_310">In the passage of the emperor through Bologna,=
 a mutiny of the guards was excited and appeased by the secret policy of St=
ilicho; who announced his instructions to decimate the guilty, and ascribed=
 to his own intercession the merit of their pardon. After this tumult, Hono=
rious embraced, for the last time, the minister whom he now considered as a=
 tyrant, and proceeded on his way to the camp of Pavia, where he was receiv=
ed by the loyal acclamations of the troops who were assembled for the servi=
ce of the Gallic war. On the morning of the fourth day, he pronounced, as h=
e had been taught, a military oration in the presence of the soldiers, whom=
 the charitable visits, and artful discourses, of Olympius had prepared to =
execute a dark and bloody conspiracy. At the first signal, they massacred t=
he friends of Stilicho, the most illustrious officers of the empire; two Pr=
=C3=A6torian prefects, of Gaul, and of Italy; two masters-general, of the c=
avalry and infantry; the master of the offices; the qu=C3=A6stor, the treas=
urer, and the count of the domestics. Many lives were lost; many houses wer=
e plundered; the furious sedition continued to rage till the close of the e=
vening; and the trembling emperor, who was seen in the streets of Pavia wit=
hout his robes or diadem, yielded to the persuasions of his favourite, cond=
emned the memory of the slain, and solemnly approved the innocence and fide=
lity of their assassins. The intelligence of the massacre of Pavia filled t=
he mind of Stilicho with just and gloomy apprehensions; and he instantly su=
mmoned, in the camp of Bologna, a council of the confederate leaders who we=
re attached to his service, and would be involved in his ruin. The impetuou=
s voice of the assembly called aloud for arms, and for revenge; to march, w=
ithout a moment=E2=80=99s delay, under the banners of a hero whom they had =
so often followed to victory; to surprise, to oppress, to extirpate the gui=
lty Olympius, and his degenerate Romans; <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"=

 the head of their injured general. Instead of executing a resolution, whic=
h might have been justified by success, Stilicho hesitated till he was irre=
coverably lost. He was still ignorant of the fate of the emperor; he distru=
sted the fidelity of his own party; and he viewed with horror the fatal con=
sequences of arming a crowd of licentious Barbarians against the soldiers a=
nd people of Italy. The confederates, impatient of his timorous and doubtfu=
l delay, hastily retired, with fear and indignation. At the hour of midnigh=
t, Sarus, a Gothic warrior, renowned among the Barbarians themselves for hi=
s strength and valour, suddenly invaded the camp of his benefactor, plunder=
ed the baggage, cut in pieces the faithful Huns, who guarded his person, an=
d penetrated to the tent, where the minister, pensive and sleepless, medita=
ted on the dangers of his situation. Stilicho escaped with difficulty from =
the sword of the Goths; and, after issuing a last and generous admonition t=
o the cities of Italy, to shut their gates against the Barbarians, his conf=
idence, or his despair, urged him to throw himself into Ravenna, which was =
already in the absolute possession of his enemies. Olympius, who had assume=
d the dominion of Honorius, was speedily informed that his rival had embrac=
ed, as a suppliant, the altar of the Christian church. The base and cruel d=
isposition of the hypocrite was incapable of pity or remorse; but he piousl=
y affected to elude, rather than to violate, the privilege of the sanctuary=
. Count Heraclian, with a troop of soldiers, appeared, at the dawn of day, =
before the gates of the church of Ravenna. The bishop was satisfied by a so=
lemn oath that the Imperial mandate only directed them to secure the person=
 of Stilicho: but, as soon as the unfortunate minister had been tempted bey=
ond the holy threshold, he produced the warrant for his instant execution. =

 deserves the epithet of sublime or pathetic; to select a verse that melts =
the heart or enlarges the imagination. We should vainly seek, in the poems =
of Claudian, the happy invention and artificial conduct of an interesting f=
able, or the just and lively representation of the characters and situation=
s of real life. For the service of his patron he published occasional paneg=
yrics and invectives; and the design of these slavish compositions encourag=

audian. He was endowed with the rare and precious talent of raising the mea=
nest, of adoring the most barren, and of diversifying the most similar topi=
cs; his colouring, more especially in descriptive poetry, is soft and splen=
did; and he seldom fails to display, and even to abuse, the advantages of a=
 cultivated understanding, a copious fancy, an easy, and sometimes forcible=

have promoted his interest at the expense of the inhuman and absurd cruelty=

f the Imperial ministers. The foreign auxiliaries who had been attached to =
the person of Stilicho lamented his death; but the desire of revenge was ch=
ecked by a natural apprehension for the safety of their wives and children;=
 who were detained as hostages in the strong cities of Italy, where they ha=

if by a common signal, the cities of Italy were polluted by the same horrid=
 scenes of universal massacre and pillage, which involved, in promiscuous d=
estruction, the families and fortunes of the Barbarians. Exasperated by suc=
h an injury, which might have awakened the tamest and most servile spirit, =
they cast a look of indignation and hope towards the camp of Alaric, and un=
animously swore to pursue, with just and implacable war, the perfidious nat=

hose seeming changes proceeded from the total want of counsel and design. F=
rom his camp, on the confines of Italy, Alaric attentively observed the rev=
olutions of the palace, watched the progress of faction and discontent, dis=
guised the hostile aspect of a Barbarian invader, and assumed the more popu=
lar appearance of the friend and ally of the great Stilicho; to whose virtu=
es, when they were no longer formidable, he could pay a just tribute of sin=
cere praise and regret. The pressing invitation of the malcontents, who urg=
ed the king of the Goths to invade Italy, was enforced by a lively sense of=
 his personal injuries; and he might speciously complain that the Imperial =
ministers still delayed and eluded the payment of the four thousand pounds =
of gold, which had been granted by the Roman senate either to reward his se=
rvices or to appease his fury. His decent firmness was supported by an artf=
ul moderation, which contributed to the success of his designs. He required=
 a fair and reasonable satisfaction; but he gave the strongest assurances t=
hat, as soon as he had obtained it, he would immediately retire. He refused=
 to trust the faith of the Romans, unless Aetius and Jason, the sons of two=
 great officers of state, were sent as hostages to his camp; but he offered=
 to deliver, in exchange, several of the noblest youths of the Gothic natio=
n. The modesty of Alaric was interpreted, by the ministers of Ravenna, as a=
 sure evidence of his weakness and fear. They disdained either to negotiate=
 a treaty or to assemble an army; and with a rash confidence, derived only =
from their ignorance of the extreme danger, irretrievably wasted the decisi=

be satisfied with relating the military exploits of the conquerors of Rome =
without presuming to investigate the motives of their political conduct. In=
 the midst of his apparent prosperity, Alaric was conscious, perhaps, of so=
me secret weakness, some internal defect; or perhaps the moderation which h=
e displayed was intended only to deceive and disarm the easy credulity of t=
he ministers of Honorius. The king of the Goths repeatedly declared that it=
 was his desire to be considered as the friend of peace and of the Romans. =
Three senators, at his earnest request, were sent ambassadors to the court =
of Ravenna, to solicit the exchange of hostages and the conclusion of the t=
reaty; and the proposals, which he more clearly expressed during the course=
 of the negotiations, could only inspire a doubt of his sincerity, as they =
might seem inadequate to the state of his fortune. The Barbarian still aspi=
red to the rank of master-general of the armies of the West; he stipulated =
an annual subsidy of corn and money; and he chose the provinces of Dalmatia=
, Noricum, and Venetia for the seat of his new kingdom, which would have co=
mmanded the important communication between Italy and the Danube. If these =
modest terms should be rejected, Alaric shewed a disposition to relinquish =

with the request of his Barbarian friend, and cut off his head. The wife of=
 Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and dis=

 practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes ro=

t and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a m=
ore formidable enemy. Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negot=
iation with the Franks and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon retur=

they engaged the infantry of Constantius in the front, they were suddenly a=
ttacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphila=
s, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear. The remains =
of the army of Edobic were preserved by flight or submission, and their lea=
der escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend; wh=
o too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an a=
cceptable and lucrative present for the Imperial general. On this occasion,=
 Constantius behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman. Subduing or s=
uppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit =
and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Ed=
obic; and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be =
polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch, who had violated the laws=
 of friendship and hospitality. The usurper, who beheld from the walls of A=
rles the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so=
 generous a conqueror. He required a solemn promise for his security; and a=
fter receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a Chris=
tian Presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city. But he soon expe=
rienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate t=
he ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines =
of political morality. The Roman general, indeed, refused to sully his laur=
els with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son Ju=
lian were sent under a strong guard into Italy; and before they reached the=
 palace of Ravenna they met the ministers of death.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_348">At a time when it was universally confessed th=

Spain and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been exting=

 the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the I=

 of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the e=
mpire advanced with a formidable host of Barbarians from the banks of the R=
hine to those of the Rhone. Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in=
 the short history of the reign of Jovinus. It was natural to expect that a=
 brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorious army, would have as=
serted in a field of battle the justice of the cause of Honorius. The hasty=
 retreat of Constantius might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resig=

 of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the a=
ssurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of Ravenna the he=
ads of the two tyrants, Jovinus and Sebastian. The king of the Goths execut=

e noblest cities of Gaul. The emperor, chosen by the Roman senate, who had =
been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insu=
lted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but, when the Gothic king withdrew=
 his protection, he was restrained by pity or contempt from offering any vi=
olence to the person of Attalus. The unfortunate Attalus, who was left with=
out subjects or allies, embarked in one of the ports of Spain, in search of=
 some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted=
 to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of Rome or=
 Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the second step =
of the throne of his <i>invincible</i> conqueror. The same measure of punis=
hment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing=
 his rival was inflicted on Attalus himself: he was condemned, after the am=
putation of two fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where =
he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life. The remainder of the r=
eign of Honorius was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that,=

a prince, who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.</p>

spent among the crowd, without wounding, or even marking, the character of =
any individual. When he declaimed against the peculiar vices of the rich, p=

character more virtues than can easily be reconciled with the violation of =
the most sacred duty. Elated by the submission of Italy and the hope of an =
alliance with the Huns, John presumed to insult, by an embassy, the majesty=

zardous a design; and the conduct of the Italian expedition was prudently e=

valour against the Persians. It was resolved that Ardaburius should embark =
with the infantry; whilst Aspar, at the head of the cavalry, conducted Plac=
idia and her son Valentinian along the sea-coast of the Hadriatic. The marc=

spar were unexpectedly confounded by the intelligence that a storm had disp=
ersed the Imperial fleet; and that his father, with only two galleys, was t=
aken and carried a prisoner into the port of Ravenna. Yet this incident, un=
fortunate as it might seem, facilitated the conquest of Italy. Ardaburius e=
mployed, or abused, the courteous freedom which he was permitted to enjoy, =
to revive among the troops a sense of loyalty and gratitude; and, as soon a=
s the conspiracy was ripe for execution, he invited, by private messages, a=

very thinking mind with the clearest idea of fertility and cultivation: the=
 country was extremely populous; the inhabitants reserved a liberal subsist=
ence for their own use; and the annual exportation, particularly of wheat, =
was so regular and plentiful that Africa deserved the name of the common gr=
anary of Rome and of mankind. On a sudden the seven fruitful provinces, fro=
m Tangier to Tripoli, were overwhelmed by the invasion of the Vandals; whos=
e destructive rage has perhaps been exaggerated by popular animosity, relig=
ious zeal, and extravagant declamation. War, in its fairest form, implies a=
 perpetual violation of humanity and justice; and the hostilities of Barbar=
ians are inflamed by the fierce and lawless spirit which incessantly distur=
bs their peaceful and domestic society. The Vandals, where they found resis=
tance, seldom gave quarter; and the deaths of their valiant countrymen were=
 expiated by the ruin of the cities under whose walls they had <span class=

 by the licentiousness of the Moors and the fanaticism of the Donatists. Ye=

 in a letter still extant, recommends Maria to the bishop of =C3=86g=C3=A6,=
 a maritime city of Cilicia, which was frequented, during the annual fair, =
by the vessels of the West, most earnestly requesting that his colleague wo=

the emperor Decius persecuted the Christians, seven noble youths of Ephesus=
 concealed themselves in a spacious cavern in the side of an adjacent mount=
ain; where they were doomed to perish by the tyrant, who gave orders that t=
he entrance should be firmly secured with a pile of huge stones. They immed=
iately fell into a deep slumber, which was miraculously prolonged, without =
injuring the powers of life, during a period of one hundred and eighty-seve=
n years. At the end of that time, the slaves of Adolius, to whom the inheri=
tance of the mountain had descended, removed the stones, to supply material=
s for some rustic edifice; the light of the sun darted into the cavern, and=
 the seven sleepers were permitted to awake. After a slumber, as they thoug=
ht, of a few hours, they were pressed by the calls of hunger; and resolved =
that Jamblichus, one of their number, should secretly return to the city, t=
o purchase bread for the use of his companions. The youth (if we may still =
employ that appellation) could no longer recognise the once familiar aspect=
 of his native country; and his surprise was increased by the appearance of=
 a large cross, triumphantly erected over the principal gate of Ephesus. Hi=
s singular dress and obsolete language confounded the baker, to whom he off=
ered an ancient medal of Decius as the current coin of the empire; and Jamb=
lichus, on the suspicion of a secret treasure, was dragged before the judge=
. Their mutual inquiries produced the amazing discovery that two centuries =
were almost elapsed since Jamblichus and his friends had escaped from the r=
age of a Pagan tyrant. The bishop of Ephesus, the clergy, the magistrates, =

 to visit the cavern of the Seven Sleepers; who bestowed their benediction,=
 related their story, and at the same instant peaceably expired. The origin=
 of this marvellous fable cannot be ascribed to the pious fraud and creduli=
ty of the <i>modern</i> Greeks, since the authentic tradition may be traced=
 within half a century of the supposed miracle. James of Sarug, a Syrian bi=

 of causes and effects, to unite the most distant revolutions. But, if the =

and recent impression of the <i>old;</i> his surprise and his reflections w=
ould furnish the pleasing subject of a philosophical romance. The scene cou=

d between the reigns of Decius and of Theodosius the younger. During this p=
eriod, the seat of government had been transported from Rome to a new city =
on the banks of the Thracian Bosphorus; and the abuse of military spirit ha=
d been suppressed by an artificial system of tame and ceremonious servitude=
. The throne of the persecuting Decius was filled by a succession of Christ=

union of the Roman empire was dissolved; its genius was humbled in the dust=

North, had established their victorious reign over the fairest provinces of=
 Europe and Africa.</p>

AND HIS ILLYRIC POLICY =E2=80=94 (<span class=3D"ptr">P. 122</span>, <span =
class=3D"ptr">144</span>)</h2>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_414">An unwary reader of Gibbon might fail to reali=
se that on two separate occasions Stilicho came, an unwelcome helper, to th=
e assistance of Arcadius in the Illyric peninsula. As there has been a diff=
iculty about the dates, and as Zosimus inverts the order of events, it is i=
mportant to grasp this clearly. On the first occasion (<span class=3D"sc"><=
span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 395) Stilicho started from Italy =
in spring (Claudian, <i>in Rufin.</i> 2, 101), came up with Alaric in Thess=
aly, and was then commanded to return, before he had accomplished anything,=
 by an order of Arcadius. Gainas and the Eastern troops went to Constantino=
ple, and Rufinus met his fate; while Stilicho returned to Italy. In the fol=
lowing year (<span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> =
396), when Alaric was in southern Greece, Stilicho again, came to help the =
realm of Arcadius, landed at Corinth, blockaded Alaric in Pholoe, and allow=
ed him to escape. (Zosimus, v. 7, places the blockade of Pholoe before the =
death of Rufinus. The charge of Zosimus that Stilicho indulged in debaucher=
y in Elis cannot safely be pressed; for the phrase he uses is borrowed from=
 Julian=E2=80=99s Misopogon. See Mendelssohn, <i>ad. loc.</i>)</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_415"><span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">a=
d</span></span> 395. Claudian represents Alaric as shutting himself up in a=
 fortified camp on the news of Stilicho=E2=80=99s approach (in Ruf. 2, 124-=
9). Stilicho arrives in Thessaly (implet Thessaliam ferri nitor, l. 179) an=
d prepares to attack the enemy. If he had been permitted to do so, the inva=
sion of Greece would have been averted (186 <i>sqq.</i>), but alas! <i>regi=
a mandata</i> arrive from Arcadius, and he has to sacrifice the =E2=80=9Cpu=
blica commoda=E2=80=9D to the duty of obedience. This must have been about =
the beginning of November, if Rufinus was slain on 27th November (as Socrat=
es states, vi. 1; cp. Chron. Pasch. ad ann.). Thus the advance of Stilicho =
from Italy to Thessaly would have occupied more than six months. What was t=
he cause of this delay? It is significant that the charge brought against R=
ufinus by Claudian of having incited the Visigoths to the invasion of Greec=
e is uttered only as a suspicion by Socrates (<i>loc. cit.,</i> =CE=B4=CF=
=8C=CE=BE=CE=B1=CE=BD =CE=B5[Editor: illegible character]=CF=87=CE=B5=CE=BD=
 =E1=BD=A1=CF=82 =CE=BA.=CF=84.=CE=BB. =E2=80=9Cwas supposed to have,=E2=80=
=9D &amp;c.); in the following century the suspicion has developed into a p=
ositive statement in the chronicle of Count Marcellinus ad ann. (Alaricum .=
 . . infestum reipublicae fecit et in Graeciam misit).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_416"><span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">a=
d</span></span> 396. (Gibbon wrongly places the events of this year in <spa=
n class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 397. It is not cl=
ear why he deserts the guidance of Tillemont.) Stilicho landed at the Isthm=
us (Zosimus, 5, 7), and is said to have had Alaric at his mercy at <span cl=
ass=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span =
class=3D"bracket">[</span>366<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> Pholoe=
. Three views have been held as to the escape of Alaric: (1) he out-witted =
Stilicho, who was culpably negligent (cp. Zosimus); (2) the suggestion of C=
laudian (B.G. 516) that Arcadius and his ministers, jealous of Stilicho=E2=
=80=99s intervention, treated with Alaric and secured his retreat, might be=
 supported by the circumstance that Arcadius created him Master of Soldiers=
 in Illyricum soon afterwards; (3) Stilicho is supposed to have made a secr=
et treaty with Alaric, and permitted his retreat, for purposes of his own.<=
/p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_417">It is certain that Stilicho=E2=80=99s assertio=
n of the unity of the Empire by appearing with armed forces in the Prefectu=
re of Illyricum was viewed with suspicion and distrust at Constantinople. T=
he feeling at the court of Arcadius is aptly expressed in words which Claud=
ian has put into the mouth of Rufinus (in Ruf. 2, 161): =E2=80=94</p>
<ul class=3D"poem">

i>
</ul>
<p class=3D"indent-no" id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_420">It is certain too that Sti=
licho afterwards, if not in <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad=
</span></span> 396, made it the aim of his policy to detach Illyricum from =
Arcadius and add it to the realm of Honorius. This is stated in so many wor=
ds by Zosimus (v. 26), and it was doubtless Stilicho=E2=80=99s object from =
the beginning. This is the view of Jung (R=C3=B6mer and Romanen, p. 188: ic=
h sehe darin vielmehr die consequente Verfolgung der durch Stilicho von Anf=
ang an beabsichtigten Politik), who has some good remarks on the geographic=
al importance of Illyricum; the unsatisfactoriness of the line of division =
of 395 which cut off Dalmatia from the rest of the Balkan peninsula (p. 186=
); and the circumstance that all northern Illyricum belonged to the Latin-s=
peaking part of the Empire.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_421">After the first invasion of Italy, Stilicho in=
tended to use the help of Alaric for this purpose, and established him on t=
he borders of the territory on which he had designs; but the execution of t=
he plan was continually deferred, on account of other events which claimed =
the care of Stilicho. Alaric during this time was playing his own game, bet=
ween the courts of Ravenna and Constantinople. His object was to obtain per=
manently Dalmatia, Noricum, Istria, and Venetia, with a regular grant of mo=
ney from the Empire. This was what he asked in 410 (Zos. v. 48), and his ai=
m throughout was doubtless a settlement of this kind.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_422">The certainty that from <span class=3D"sc"><sp=
an class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 402 forward Stilicho made use of Al=
aric for his Illyric designs rouses the suspicion that he was playing with =
Alaric, with the same intent, in <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity a=
d">ad</span></span> 395 and 396. The famous words of Orosius (vii. 37): Ala=
rico rege cum Gothis suis saepe victo saepe concluso semperque dimisso, are=
 strikingly true of Pollentia, of Verona, and of Pholoe; I suspect that the=
y are also true of the campaign of <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity=
 ad">ad</span></span> 395, and that the unaccountable delay between Stilich=
o=E2=80=99s start in the spring and his return to Italy in Oct.-Nov. was du=
e to diplomatic dallyings with Alaric. Of course nothing would be said of t=
hat by Claudian.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_423">While Stilicho aimed at annexing eastern Illyr=
icum, the court of Constantinople aimed at the acquisition of Dalmatia. Oly=
mpiodorus says that Stilicho employed Alaric to defend it (fr. 3). The obje=
ct was pursued in the reign of Theodosius ii. and was finally attained at t=
he marriage of Eudoxia with Valentinian iii., when the boundary was changed=
 to the advantage of the East. Compare Cassiodorius, Var. ep. 1, G=C3=BClde=
npenning, das ostr=C3=B6m. Reich, p. 310. But even as early as <span class=
=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 414-15 there is epigraph=
ic evidence suggesting the conclusion that at that time Salonae was under t=
he government of Constantinople. See Jung, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 187 note.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_424">It is possible to regard (with Keller; Stilich=
o, p. 27) Stilicho=E2=80=99s special <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"deco=

h Alaric as part of a larger policy which had two chief aims: to maintain t=

 by absorbing barbarians. Stilicho=E2=80=99s policy has been generally misu=
nderstood. A monograph appeared in the year 1805 with the curious title: Fl=
avius Stilicho, ein Wallenstein der Vorwelt (by C. F. Schulz).</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_425">Though no record tells that Alaric burnt down =
the Temple of Eleusis, it is certain that the invasion of the Goths was coi=
ncident with the end of the Eleusinian mysteries. The sanctuary of the two =
goddesses must have already suffered much under Jovian and Theodosius. The =
cult, restored by Julian, was suppressed by Jovian, but renewed again under=
 Valentinian through the intervention of Praetextatus, proconsul of Achaia.=
 It must have been affected by the intolerant edicts of Theodosius; certain=
ly the demonstration of the Christian section of the Athenian community for=
ced the last Eumolpid high priest to resign. Subsequently =E2=80=94 probabl=
y on the death of Theodosius =E2=80=94 the pagan party felt themselves stro=
ng enough to appoint, as hierophant, a priest of Mithras from Thespiae, and=
 he persided at Eleusis at the time of Alaric=E2=80=99s invasion.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_426">See Gregorovius, Hat Alarich die Nationalg=C3=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_427">As for Athens, there is no doubt that it capit=
ulated and was spared by Alaric, and that the Goths did not destroy or rob =
its art treasures. Athens suffered, as Gregorovius remarks, less in the inv=
asion of Alaric than in the invasion in the time of Dexippus. There were of=
 course acts of cruelty; some are recorded in the <i>Vita Prisci</i> of Eun=
apius. But we must not press the words of Claudian (in Rufin. ii. 189): nec=
 fera Cecropiae traxissent vincula matres, further than at the most to inte=
rpret it of the rural inhabitants of Attica. Gregorovius observes that in t=
he other passages where the devastation of Greece is mentioned (iv. Cons. H=
on. 471, Eutrop. 2, 199, cons. Stil. i. 180), there is not a word about Ath=
ens.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_428">As to the Zeus-temple of Olympia, it is suppos=
ed that the Phidiac statue of Zeus had been removed about two years before =
the Gothic invasion (in <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</sp=
an></span> 394, when Theodosius suppressed the Olympic games) to Constantin=
ople and was afterwards burned in the Palace of Lausus. Cp. Cedrenus, i. p.=
 364 (Gregorovius i. p. 43). The temple of Olympia was burnt down in the re=
ign of Theodosius ii.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_429">The general conclusion of Gregorovius is that =
it is a gross exaggeration to ascribe to the Goths the deliberate destructi=

Honorius was in Milan, as is clear from Claudian=E2=80=99s description (<i>=

</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_461">From Gibbon=E2=80=99s narrative one would draw=
 the conclusion that this invasion of Italy in 405 (406 Gibbon incorrectly;=
 see Clinton, ad ann.) was the first occasion on which Radagaisus appeared =
on the stage of Imperial events. But he appeared before. A notice of Prospe=
r, which there is not the smallest cause to question, represents him as co-=
operating with Alaric, when Alaric invaded Italy. Under the year 400 (there=
 may be reason for questioning the year; see last Appendix) in his Chronicl=
e we find the record: Gothi Italiam Alarico et Radagaiso ducibus ingressi. =
It is perfectly arbitary to assume that the notice of the action of Radagai=

 whether (as Birt thinks) the barbarians whom Radagaisus headed in Raetia w=
ere the Vandals and Alans who invaded Gaul in 406, we may without hesitatio=

 with which Zosimus introduces his account of the overthrow of Radagaisus b=
y Stilicho; and proposes to refer that statement not to the campaign of 405=
 but to that of 401.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_463">It was satisfactory to find that Birt had alre=
ady taken a step in a direction in which I had been led before I studied hi=
s Preface to Claudian. The fact is that <i>Zosimus really recounts the camp=
aign of</i> 401, <i>as if it were the campaign of</i> 405. His story is tha=
t Radagaisus prepared to invade Italy. The news created great terror, and S=
tilicho broke up with the army from Ticinum, and with as many Alans and Hun=
s as he could muster, without waiting for the attack, crossed the Ister, an=
d assailing the barbarians unexpectedly utterly destroyed their host. This =
<i>is</i> the campaign of the winter of 401-2, of which we know from Claudi=
an=E2=80=99s <i>Gothic War;</i> only that (1) Zosimus, placing it in 405, h=
as added one feature of the actual campaign in 405, namely the all but tota=
l annihilation of the army of Radagaisus, and that (2) Zosimus, in placing =
the final action beyond the Danube, differs from Claudian, who places it in=
 Noricum or Vindelicia (l. 365, cited above) and does not mention that Stil=
icho crossed the river. But the winter campaign was in Danubian regions; an=
d the main difficulty, the appearance of the Danube in the narrative of Zos=
imus, seems to be satisfactorily accounted for by the assumption of this co=
nfusion between the two Radagaisus episodes, a confusion which must be ascr=
ibed to Zosimus himself rather than to his source Olympiodorus.<a href=3D"h=

Richborough (Rutupiae). See Numismatic Chronicle, 3rd ser. vol. vii. p. 191=

unexampled on a Roman coin. Mr. Evans conjectures that CONSTANTINO is to be=

 But he raises the siege on the seventh day, on account of the approach of =

is rule over the rest of the Gallic prefecture, =E2=80=94 Spain. We are lef=
t quite in the dark as to his relations with the Barbarians who in these ye=
ars (407-9) were ravaging Gaul. Spain at first submitted to those whom Cons=
tantine sent; but very soon the influential Theodosian family organised a r=
evolt against it. The main part of the resistance came from Lusitania, wher=
e the four Theodosian brothers had most influence. The rustic army that was=
 collected was set to guard the Pyrenees. To put down the rising, Constanti=
ne sent troops a second time into Spain =E2=80=94 this time under the Caesa=
r Constans, who was accompanied by Gerontius and by Appollinaris (grandfath=
er of the poet Sidonius), who accepted the office of Praetorian Prefect fro=
m Constantine. The Theodosian revolt was suppressed; Constans set up his co=
urt in Caesar-augusta (Zaragoza), but soon returned to Gaul, leaving Geront=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_470">The sources for this story are Orosius, Sozome=

ing, and Sozomen seems to have gained, from some quarter or other, a singul=
ar knowledge of detail of some parts of the story=E2=80=9D (Freeman, p. 65)=
. It is practically certain that Sozomen=E2=80=99s source (as well as that =
of Zosimus) was Olympiodorus (cp. above, vol. ii. Appendix 10, p. 365).</p>

 409) too weak to resist, to acknowledge him as his colleague and legitimat=
e Augustus. Later in the year he enters Italy with an army, avowedly to hel=
p Honorius against Alaric (so Olympiodorus), his real motive being to annex=
 Italy to his own realm (Soz. ix. 12). At this time he probably raised Cons=
tans to the rank of Augustus. It appears that Constantine was in league wit=
h Allobich, the general of Honorius, to compass his treasonable designs. Th=
ey were discovered, Allobich was cut down, and then Constantine, who had no=
t yet reached Ravenna, turned back.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_472">Meanwhile the revolt of Gerontius in Spain had=
 broken out, and Constans went to put it down. Gibbon=E2=80=99s account of =
the revolt is inadequate, in so far as he does not point out its connection=
 with the invasion of Spain by the Vandals, Sueves, and Alans. There is no =
doubt that Gerontius and Maximus invited them to cross the Pyrenees. (Cp. O=
lymp.; Oros. 7, 28; Sozom. ix. 113; Zos. 6, 5; Renatus, in Gregory of Tours=
, 2, 9; Freeman, p. 74: =E2=80=9CThe evidence seems to go for direct dealin=
gs between Gerontius and the invaders, and his treaty with them is more lik=
ely to have followed the proclamation of Maximus than to have gone before i=
t.=E2=80=9D) The dominion of Maximus was practically confined to the northw=
estern corner; the seat of his rule was Tarraco. As for the relation of Max=
imus to Gerontius, it is very doubtful whether =CF=80=CE=B1=C9=A9=CC=82=CE=
=B4=CE=B1 in Olympiodorus is to be interpreted <i>son</i> and not rather <i=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_473">The rest of the episode of Constantine=E2=80=
=99s reign =E2=80=94 the sieges of Vienna (which, some have suspected, is a=
 mistake for Narbo) and Arelate =E2=80=94 have been well told by Gibbon. Th=
ese events must be placed in the year 411; for Constantine=E2=80=99s head a=
rrived at Ravenna on 18th September (Idatius ad ann.), and it was in the fo=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_474">Mr. Freeman thus contrasts the position of Con=

f the marches of Ataulf in Gaul and Spain. Jovinus was set up by Burgundian=
 and Alan help; his elevation to the Empire and the earliest Burgundian set=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_480">Gibbon wrongly places the division of the Arme=

sion was arranged between Theodosius the Great and the Persian King. See Sa=
int Martin, M=C3=A9moires, p. 316. Persarmenia was at least two-thirds of t=
he whole kingdom. Arsaces, who had already reigned 5 years over all Armenia=
, continued after the division to rule over Roman Armenia for 2=C2=BD years=
; while Chosrov (a Christian) was appointed by Persia as king of Persian Ar=
menia. On the death of Arsaces, Theodosius committed the rule of the Roman =
part to a native general, who was induced to recognise the authority of Cho=
srov; while Chosrov, in order to secure his position in Roman Armenia, ackn=
owledged the suzerainty of the Roman Empire. This did not please Persia, an=
d Jezdegird, son of the Persian king, overthrew him, after he had reigned 5=
 years. Jezdegird then gave Armenia to Chosrov=E2=80=99s brother; but Chosr=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_482">In his <i>Italy and her Invaders,</i> vol. ii.=
 (p. 206 <i>sqq.,</i> ed. 2) Mr. Hodgkin has discussed and rejected the rom=
antic story connected with the death of Valentinian, the elevation of Maxim=
us and his marriage with Eudoxia. The story is told by Procopius (de B. V. =
i. 4); and, in accordance with Gibbon=E2=80=99s criticism that =E2=80=9CPro=
copius is a fabulous writer for the events which precede his own memory,=E2=
=80=9D Mr. Hodgkin relegates it to =E2=80=9Cthe fables of Procopius.=E2=80=
=9D</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_483">In the <i>English Historical Review</i> for Ju=
ly, 1887 (p. 417-465), Mr. Freeman published a long criticism of the histor=
ical material for the careers of Aetius and Boniface. He held the account o=
f Procopius (B. V. i. 3) to be =E2=80=9Clegend of the sixth century and not=
 trustworthy history of the fifth,=E2=80=9D and tried to =E2=80=9Crecover t=
he true story as it may be put together from the annalists, the writings of=
 St. Augustine, and other more trustworthy authorities.=E2=80=9D In this ca=
se Mr. Hodgkin takes a completely different view and argues (<i>ib.,</i> vo=
l. i. p. 889 <i>sqq.,</i> ed. 2) that the Procopian legend =E2=80=9Chas sti=
ll a reasonable <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: curr=

">]</span></span> claim to be accepted as history,=E2=80=9D while admitting=
 that in some points it has been shaken by Mr. Freeman.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_484">Now, while the two stories need not stand on t=
he same footing so far as historical credibility is concerned, while it may=
 be possible to follow Mr. Hodgkin in rejecting the one and accepting the m=
ain part of the other, there is a preliminary question which must be discus=
sed before we attempt to decide the ultimate question of historical fact. P=
rocopius is not the only authority for these stories. They are also found i=
n the Salmasian Excerpts, which were first printed by Cramer in his Anecdot=
a Parisina, ii. 383 <i>sqq.,</i> and afterwards included among the fragment=
s of John of Antioch by C. M=C3=BCller, in the Fragmenta Hist. Gr=C3=A6c., =
vol. iv. p. 535 <i>sqq.</i> The fragments in question are 196 and 200. It w=
as a serious flaw in Mr. Freeman=E2=80=99s essay that he was not aware eith=
er of the Salmasian Excerpt 196, or of the Constantinian Excerpt 201, which=
 also bears on the question of Aetius and Boniface. Mr. Hodgkin refers to f=
r. 196, which (with M=C3=BCller) he ascribes to Joannes Antiochenus, and sa=
ys: =E2=80=9CThough a comparatively late author (he probably lived in the s=
eventh century) and though he certainly used Procopius freely in his compil=
ation, he had also some good contemporary authorities before him, especiall=
y Priscus, and there seems some probability, though I would not state it mo=
re strongly than this, that he may have found the story in one of them as w=
ell as in Procopius.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_485">But Mr. Hodgkin, while he takes account of fr.=
 196 in defending one =E2=80=9CProcopian legend,=E2=80=9D takes no account =
of fr. 200 in rejecting the other =E2=80=9CProcopian legend,=E2=80=9D thoug=
h fr. 200 bears to the latter the same relation which fr. 196 bears to the =
former.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_486">Now in the first place it must be clearly unde=
rstood that the author of the work from which the Salmasian Excerpts are de=
rived cannot have been the same as the author of the work from which the Co=
nstantinian Excerpts are derived. There is no question about this, and it c=
ould be proved merely by comparing the two (Salmasian) fragments under cons=
ideration (frags. 196 and 200) with (the Constantinian) fragment 201. If th=
en we accept the Constantinian Excerpts under the name Joannes of Antioch, =
we must be careful not to ascribe the Salmasian Excerpts to that writer. Wh=
ich is the true Joannes, is a question still <i>sub judice.</i> (See below,=
 vol. vi. Appendix 2.)</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_487">The vital question then is whether Procopius w=
as the source of S. (as we may designate the author of these Excerpts) for =
these fragments or not. For if he was, S. adds no weight to the authority o=
f Procopius and may be disregarded; it he were not, his statements have to =
be reckoned with too. From a careful comparison of the passages, I find mys=
elf in complete agreement with C. de Boor (who has dealt with the question =
in Byz. Ztsch. ii. 204 <i>sqq.</i>) that Procopius was <i>not</i> the sourc=
e of S. but that the accounts of both authors were derived from a common so=
urce.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/gibbon-the-history-of-the=

(see M=C3=BCller <i>ad loc.</i>) a fragment of what was evidently that comm=
on source.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_488">The inference, for historical purposes, is imp=
ortant. We cannot speak with Mr. Freeman of =E2=80=9CProcopian legend=E2=80=

escribed in these cases as setting down =E2=80=9Cthe received tale that he =
<i>heard.</i>=E2=80=9D He was using a literary source; and there is not the=
 slightest proof that this literary source belonged to the sixth century. I=
t seems more probable that it was a fifth century source. It <i>may</i> hav=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_489">These two episodes therefore depend on the aut=
hority of a writer (who has so far not been identified) earlier than Procop=
ius and distinct from John of Antioch. They may for all we know have very e=
arly authority, and they cannot be waived away as =E2=80=9CProcopian legend=
.=E2=80=9D Each must be judged on its own merits.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_490">It seems to me that there was probably a certa=
in foundation of truth in both stories, but that they have been dressed out=
 with fictitious details (like the story of the Empress Eudocia and Paulinu=

trigued against Bonifacius and that Valentinian seduced the wife of Maximus=
.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_491">The story of the single combat of Aetius and B=
oniface is derived from Marcellinus (like Procopius, a writer of the sixth =
century). But rightly interpreted it contains nothing improbable. It does n=
ot imply a duel; but a single combat <i>in a battle.</i> It is however impo=
rtant to observe that =E2=80=9CJohn of Antioch=E2=80=9D (fr. 201, M=C3=BCll=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_494">The interpretation of the Egyptian allegory of=
 Synesius has caused a good deal of trouble, owing to the fact that our oth=

cognised that Egypt stood for the Empire, and Thebes for Constantinople; an=
d the Praetorian Prefect Aurelian had been detected under the veil of Osiri=
s. But no certainty had been attained as to the identity of Typhos, the wic=

 on the basis of the work of Synesius (cp. my Later Roman Empire, i. p. 79 =

ucceeded in proving the identity of Typhos and in interpreting the allegory=
 more fully (<i>Philologus,</i> 52, p. 442 <i>sqq.,</i> 1894). His results =
must be briefly noted.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_495">1. <i>Taurus.</i> =E2=80=94 Synesius states in=

He was quaestor in 353, and became praetorian prefect in 355. He held this =

nage in distributing offices, the power of oppressing towns (p. 1217), and =
the duty of regulating measures in connection with the payment of taxes in =
kind (p. 1219). These hints taken along with the mention (<i>ib.</i>) of to=
rch-bearing attendants show that the office was no less than that of Praeto=
rian Prefect. It follows that Typhos was Praetorian Prefect before 399, and=
 again in 400.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_500">Eutropius had endeavoured to reduce the power =
of Praetorian Prefect of the East by making it a collegial office; and Euty=
chianus appears as holding that office (1) along with Caesarius while Eutro=
pius was in power; (2) along with Aurelian, 399-400; (3) along with Aurelia=
n when he was restored 402. It may be assumed that he also held it between =
400 and 402.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_501">It follows that Caesarius, whom we find Praeto=
rian Prefect from 396-398, and again in 400 and 401, was the prototype of T=
yphos, the son of Taurus and the brother of Aurelian. Some other points con=
firm the conclusion. The tendency to Arianism, of which Typhos is accused, =
is illustrated by C. Th. 16, 5, 25, and the passion of Typhos for his wife =
by a notice in Sozomen, 9, 2.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-05_502">The great political object of Aurelian was to =
break the power of the Germans in the army and at the court =E2=80=94 the p=
olicy for which Synesius pleaded in his <i>De Regno.</i> The question arise=
s: What was the attitude of the Empress Eudoxia to this policy? The fall of=
 Eutropius which she brought about (Phil. 11, 6) led to the rise of Aurelia=
n, and when Aurelian fell, her intimate friend =E2=80=94 scandal said, her =

earned Tillemont (M=C3=A9m. Eccl=C3=A9s., tom. xi. p. 1-405, 547-626, &amp;=
c. &amp;c.); who compiles the lives of the saints with incredible patience =
and religious accuracy. He has minutely searched the voluminous works of Ch=
rysostom himself. 4. Father Montfaucon, who has perused those works with th=

n reviewed and composed the life of Chrysostom (Opera Chrysostom, tom. xiii=
