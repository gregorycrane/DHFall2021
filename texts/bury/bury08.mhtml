Audoin, =E2=80=9Cof the wise customs of our ancestors. Whatever may be his =
merit, a prince is incapable of sitting at table with his father till he ha=
s received his arms from a foreign and royal hand.=E2=80=9D Alboin bowed wi=
th reverence to the institutions of his country, selected forty companions,=
 and boldly visited the court of Turisund king of the Gepid=C3=A6, who embr=
aced and entertained, according to the laws of hospitality, the murderer of=
 his son. At the banquet, whilst Alboin occupied the seat of the youth whom=
 he had slain, a tender remembrance arose in the mind of Turisund. =E2=80=
=9CHow dear is that place =E2=80=94 how hateful is that person!=E2=80=9D we=
re the words that escaped, with a sigh, from the indignant father. His grie=
f exasperated the national resentment of the Gepid=C3=A6; and Cunimund, his=
 surviving son, was provoked by wine, or fraternal affection, to the desire=
 of vengeance. =E2=80=9CThe Lombards,=E2=80=9D said the rude Barbarian, =E2=
=80=9Cresemble, in figure and in smell, the mares of our Sarmatian plains.=
=E2=80=9D And this insult was a coarse allusion to the white bands which en=
veloped their legs. =E2=80=9CAdd another resemblance,=E2=80=9D replied an a=
udacious Lombard; =E2=80=9Cyou have felt how strongly they kick. Visit the =
plain of Asfeld, and seek for the bones of thy brother; they are mingled wi=
th those of the vilest animals.=E2=80=9D The Gepid=C3=A6, a nation of warri=
ors, started from their seats, and the fearless Alboin, with his forty comp=
anions, laid their hands on their swords. The tumult was appeased by the ve=
nerable interposition of Turisund. He saved his own honour, and the life of=
 his guest; and, after the solemn rites of investiture, dismissed the stran=
ger in the bloody arms of his son, the gift of a weeping parent. Alboin ret=
urned in triumph; and the Lombards, who celebrated his matchless intrepidit=

 faith and policy soon yielded to the hope of possessing the fair Rosamond,=
 and of insulting her family and nation. The arts of persuasion were tried =
without success; and the impatient lover, by force and stratagem, obtained =
the object of his desires. War was the consequence which he foresaw and sol=
icited; but the Lombards could not long withstand the furious assault of th=
e Gepid=C3=A6, who were sustained by a Roman army. And, as the offer of mar=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_293">When a public quarrel is envenomed by private =
injuries, a blow that is not mortal or decisive can be productive only of a=
 short truce, which allows the unsuccessful combatant to sharpen his arms f=
or a new encounter. The strength of Alboin had been found unequal to the gr=
atification of his love, ambition, and revenge; he condescended to implore =
the formidable aid of the chagan; and the arguments that he employed are ex=
pressive of the art and policy of the Barbarians. In the attack of the Gepi=
d=C3=A6 he had been prompted by the just desire of extirpating a people who=
m their alliance with the Roman empire had rendered the common enemies of t=
he nations and the personal adversaries of the chagan. If the forces of the=
 Avars and the Lombards should unite in this glorious quarrel, the victory =
was secure, and the reward inestimable: the Danube, the Hebrus, Italy, and =
Constantinople would be exposed, without a barrier, to their invincible <sp=
an class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><=
span class=3D"bracket">[</span>8<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> arm=
s. But, if they hesitated or delayed to prevent the malice of the Romans, t=
he same spirit which had insulted, would pursue the Avars to the extremity =
of the earth. These specious reasons were heard by the chagan with coldness=
 and disdain; he detained the Lombard ambassadors in his camp, protracted t=
he negotiation, and by turns alleged his want of inclination, or his want o=
f ability, to undertake this important enterprise. At length he signified t=
he ultimate price of his alliance, that the Lombards should immediately pre=
sent him with the tithe of their cattle; that the spoils and captives shoul=
d be equally divided; but that the lands of the Gepid=C3=A6 should become t=
he sole patrimony of the Avars. Such hard conditions were eagerly accepted =
by the passions of Alboin; and, as the Romans were dissatisfied with the in=
gratitude and perfidy of the Gepid=C3=A6, Justin abandoned that incorrigibl=
e people to their fate, and remained the tranquil spectator of this unequal=
 conflict.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/gibbon-the-history-o=

sient; and, before he could regulate his new conquests, Alboin fell a sacri=
fice to domestic treason and female revenge. In a palace near Verona, which=
 had not been erected for the Barbarians, he feasted the companions of his =
arms; intoxication was the reward of valour, and the king himself was tempt=
ed by appetite, or vanity, to exceed the ordinary measure of his intemperan=
ce. After draining many capacious bowls of Rh=C3=A6tian or Falernian wine, =
he called for the skull of Cunimund, the noblest and most precious ornament=

g it with her lips, pronounced a silent imprecation, that the insult should=
 be washed away in the blood of Alboin. Some indulgence might be due to the=
 resentment of a daughter, if she had not already violated the duties of a =
wife. Implacable in her enmity, or inconstant in her love, the queen of Ita=
ly had stooped from the throne to the arms of a subject, and Helmichis, the=
 king=E2=80=99s armour-bearer, was the secret minister of her pleasure and =

cruples of fidelity or gratitude; but Helmichis trembled, when he revolved =
the danger as well as the guilt, when he recollected the matchless strength=
 and intrepidity of a warrior whom he had so often attended in the field of=
 battle. He pressed, and obtained, that one of the bravest champions of the=
 Lombards should be associated to the enterprise, but no more than a promis=
e of secrecy could be drawn from the gallant Peredeus; and the mode of sedu=
ction employed by Rosamond betrays her shameless insensibility both to hono=
ur and love. She supplied the place of one of her female attendants who was=
 beloved by Peredeus, and contrived some excuse for darkness and silence, t=
ill she could inform her companion that he had enjoyed the queen of the Lom=
bards, and that his own death, or the death of Alboin, must be the conseque=

 and Rosamond, after lulling him to rest by her tender caresses, unbolted t=
he chamber-door, and urged the reluctant conspirators to the instant execut=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_298">The ambitious Rosamond aspired to reign in the=
 name of her lover; the city and palace of Verona were awed by her power; a=

venge, and to second the wishes, of their sovereign. But the Lombard chiefs=
, who fled in the first moments of consternation and disorder, had resumed =
their courage and collected their powers; and the nation, instead of submit=
ting to her reign, demanded, with unanimous cries, that justice should be e=
xecuted on the guilty spouse and the murderers of their king. She sought a =
refuge among the enemies of her country, and a criminal who deserved the ab=
horrence of mankind was protected by the selfish policy of the exarch. With=
 her daughter, the heiress of the Lombard throne, her two lovers, her trust=
y Gepid=C3=A6, and the spoils of the palace of Verona, Rosamond descended t=
he Adige and the Po, and was transported by a Greek vessel to the safe harb=
our of Ravenna. Longinus beheld with delight the charms and the treasures o=
f the widow of Alboin; her situation and her past conduct might justify the=
 most licentious proposals; and she readily listened to the passion of a mi=
nister, who, even in the decline of the empire, was respected as the equal =
of kings. The death of a jealous lover was an easy and grateful sacrifice, =
and, as Helmichis issued from the bath, he received the deadly potion from =
the hand of his mistress. The taste of the liquor, its speedy operation, an=
d his experience of the character of Rosamond convinced him that he was poi=
soned: he pointed his dagger to her breast, compelled her to drain the rema=
inder of the cup, and expired in a few minutes, with the consolation that s=
he could not survive to enjoy the fruits of her wickedness. The daughter of=
 Alboin and Rosamond, with the richest spoils of the Lombards, was embarked=

py of the adventures of Samson. By the free suffrage of the nation, in the =
assembly of Pavia, Clepho, one of their noblest chiefs, was elected as the =
successor of Alboin. Before the end of eighteen months, the throne was poll=

, and repaid with a courtly smile, the fair expressions of regard and confi=

ancient enemies; and Justinian, the son of Germanus, was employed as the in=
strument of her revenge. The pride of the reigning house supported, with re=
luctance, the dominion of a stranger; the youth was deservedly popular; his=
 name, after the death of Justin, had been mentioned by a tumultuous factio=
n; and his own submissive offer of his head, with a treasure of sixty thous=
and pounds, might be interpreted as an evidence of guilt, or at least of fe=
ar. Justinian received a free pardon, and the command of the Eastern army. =
The Persian monarch fled before his arms; and the acclamations which accomp=
anied his triumph declared him worthy of the purple. His artful patroness h=
ad chosen the month of the vintage, while the emperor, in a rural solitude,=
 was permitted to enjoy the pleasures of a subject. On the first intelligen=
ce of her designs he returned to Constantinople, and the conspiracy was sup=
pressed by his presence and firmness. From the pomp and honours which she h=
ad abused, Sophia was reduced to a modest allowance; Tiberius dismissed her=
 train, intercepted her correspondence, and committed to a faithful guard t=
he custody of her person. But the services of Justinian were not considered=
 by that excellent prince as an aggravation of his offences; after a mild r=
eproof, his treason and ingratitude were forgiven; and it was commonly beli=
eved that the emperor entertained some thoughts of contracting a double all=
iance with the rival of his throne. The voice of an angel (such a fable was=
 propagated) might reveal to the emperor that he should always triumph over=
 his domestic foes; but Tiberius derived a firmer assurance from the innoce=

 a sovereign affable in his palace, pious in the church, impartial on the s=

s of his own subjects had a dearer claim to his beneficence, and he measure=
d his bounty not so much by their expectations as by his own dignity. This =
maxim, however dangerous in a trustee of the public wealth, was balanced by=
 a principle of humanity and justice, which taught him to abhor, as of the =
basest alloy, the gold that was extracted from the tears of the people. For=
 their relief, as often as they had suffered by natural or hostile calamiti=
es, he was impatient to remit the arrears of the past, or the demands of fu=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_303">From Italy the emperors were incessantly torme=
nted by tales of misery and demands of succour, which extorted the humiliat=
ing confession of their own weakness. The expiring dignity of Rome was only=
 marked by the freedom and energy of her complaints: =E2=80=9CIf you are in=
capable,=E2=80=9D she said, =E2=80=9Cof delivering us from the sword of the=
 Lombards, save us at least from the calamity of famine.=E2=80=9D Tiberius =
forgave the reproach, and relieved the distress: a supply of corn was trans=
ported from Egypt to the Tiber; and the Roman people, invoking the name, no=
t of Camillus, but of St. Peter, repulsed the Barbarians from their walls. =
But the relief was accidental, the danger was perpetual and pressing; and t=
he clergy and senate, collecting the remains of their ancient opulence, a s=
um of three thousand pounds of gold, despatched the patrician Pamphronius t=
o lay their gifts and their complaints at the foot of the Byzantine throne.=
 The attention of the court, and the forces of the East, were diverted by t=
he Persian war; but the justice of Tiberius applied the subsidy to the defe=
nce of the city; and he dismissed the patrician with his best advice, eithe=
r to bribe the Lombard chiefs or to purchase the aid of the kings of France=
. Notwithstanding this weak invention, Italy was still afflicted, Rome was =
again besieged, and the suburb of Classe, only three miles from Ravenna, wa=
s pillaged and occupied by the troops of a simple duke of Spoleto. Maurice =
gave audience to a second deputation of priests and senators; the duties an=
d the menaces of religion were forcibly urged in the letters of the Roman p=
ontiff; and his nuncio, the deacon Gregory, was alike qualified to solicit =
the powers either of heaven or of the earth. The emperor adopted, with stro=
nger effect, the measures of his predecessor; some formidable chiefs were p=
ersuaded to embrace the friendship of the Romans, and one of them, a mild a=
nd faithful Barbarian, lived and died in the service of the exarch; the pas=

 to violate, without scruple, their oaths and engagements to the misbelieve=
rs. Childebert, the great-grandson of Clovis, was persuaded to invade Italy=
 by the payment of fifty thousand pieces; but, as he had viewed with deligh=
t some Byzantine coin of the weight of one pound of gold, the king of Austr=
asia might stipulate that the gift should be rendered more worthy of his ac=
ceptance by a proper mixture of these respectable medals. The dukes of the =
Lombards had provoked by frequent inroads their powerful neighbours of Gaul=
. As soon as they were apprehensive of a just retaliation, they renounced t=
heir feeble and disorderly independence; the advantages of regal government=
, union, secrecy, and vigour were unanimously confessed; and Autharis, the =
son of Clepho, had already attained the strength and reputation of a warrio=
r. Under the standard of their new king, the conquerors of Italy withstood =
three successive invasions, one of which was led by Childebert himself, the=
 last of the Merovingian race who descended from the Alps. The first expedi=
tion was defeated by the jealous animosity of the Franks and Alemanni. In t=
he second they were vanquished in a bloody battle, with more loss and disho=
nour than they had sustained since the foundation of their monarchy. Impati=
ent for revenge, they returned a third time with accumulated force, and Aut=
haris yielded to the fury of the torrent. The troops and treasures of the L=
ombards were distributed in the walled towns between the Alps and the Apenn=
ine. A nation less sensible of danger than of fatigue and delay soon murmur=
ed against the folly of their twenty commanders; and the hot vapours of an =
Italian sun infected with disease those tramontane bodies which had already=
 suffered the vicissitudes of intemperance and famine. The powers that were=
 inadequate to the conquest, were more than sufficient for the desolation, =
of the country; nor could the trembling natives distinguish between their e=
nemies and their deliverers. If the junction of the Merovingian and Imperia=

ays the signal of a flaming village, and the arms of the Greeks were idly e=

er the retreat of their Transalpine allies. The victorious Autharis asserte=
d his claim to the dominion of Italy. At the foot of the Rh=C3=A6tian Alps,=
 he subdued the resistance, and rifled the hidden treasures, of a sequester=

be unknown in this life and glorious only in the next. Yet his devotion, an=

rafty and ambitious statesman. The talents of Gregory, and the splendour wh=
ich accompanied his retreat, rendered him dear and useful to the church; an=
d implicit obedience has been always inculcated as the first duty of a monk=
. As soon as he had received the character of deacon, Gregory was sent to r=
eside at the Byzantine court, the nuncio or minister of the apostolic see; =
and he boldly assumed, in the name of St. Peter, a tone of independent dign=
ity, which would have been criminal and dangerous in the most illustrious l=
ayman of the empire. He returned to Rome with a just increase of reputation=
, and, after a short exercise of the monastic virtues, he was dragged from =
the cloister to the papal throne, by the unanimous voice of the clergy, the=
 senate, and the people. He alone resisted, <span class=3D"pb"><span class=

elevation; and his humble petition that Maurice would be pleased to reject =
the choice of the Romans could only serve to exalt his character in the eye=

gory solicited the aid of some friendly merchants to convey him in a basket=
 beyond the gates of Rome, and modestly concealed himself some days among t=

a celestial light.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_310">The pontificate of Gregory the <i>Great,</i> w=
hich lasted thirteen years six months and ten days, is one of the most edif=
ying periods of the history of the church. His virtues, and even his faults=
, a singular mixture of simplicity and cunning, of pride and humility, of s=
ense and superstition, were happily suited to his station and to the temper=
 of the times. In his rival, the patriarch of Constantinople, he condemned =
the antichristian title of universal bishop, which the successor of St. Pet=
er was too haughty to concede, and too feeble to assume; and the ecclesiast=
ical jurisdiction of Gregory was confined to the triple character of bishop=
 of Rome, primate of Italy, and apostle of the West. He frequently ascended=
 the pulpit, and kindled, by his rude though pathetic eloquence, the congen=
ial passions of his audience; the language of the Jewish prophets was inter=
preted and applied; and the minds of the people, depressed by their present=
 calamities, were directed to the hopes and fears of the invisible world. H=

reasurers were continually summoned to satisfy, in his name, the extraordin=

lpless, of strangers and pilgrims, was relieved by the bounty of each day, =
and of every hour; nor would the pontiff indulge himself in a frugal repast=
, till he had sent the dishes from his own table to some objects deserving =
of his compassion. The misery of the times had reduced the nobles and matro=

enefactor; and many bishops of Italy escaped from the Barbarians to the hos=
pitable threshold of the Vatican. Gregory might justly be styled the Father=
 of his country; and such was the extreme sensibility of his conscience tha=
t, for the death of a beggar who had perished in the streets, he interdicte=
d himself during several days from the exercise of sacerdotal functions. II=
. The misfortunes of Rome involved the apostolical pastor in the business o=
f peace and war; and it might be doubtful to himself whether piety or ambit=
ion prompted him to supply the place of his absent sovereign. Gregory awake=
ned the emperor from a long slumber, exposed the guilt or incapacity of the=
 exarch and his inferior ministers, complained that the veterans were withd=
rawn from Rome for the defence of Spoleto, encouraged the Italians to guard=
 their cities and altars, and condescended, in the crisis of danger, to nam=
e the tribunes and to direct the operations of the provincial troops. But t=
he martial spirit of the pope was checked by the scruples of humanity and r=
eligion; the imposition of tribute, though it was employed in the Italian w=
ar, he freely condemned as odious and oppressive; whilst he protected, agai=
nst the Imperial edicts, the pious cowardice of the soldiers who deserted a=
 military for a monastic life. If we may credit his own declarations, it wo=
uld have been easy for Gregory to exterminate the Lombards by their domesti=
c factions, without leaving a king, a duke, or a count, to save that unfort=
unate nation from the vengeance of their foes. As a Christian bishop, he pr=
eferred the salutary offices of peace; his mediation appeased the tumult of=
 arms; but he was too conscious of the arts of the Greeks, and the passions=
 of the Lombards, to engage his sacred promise for the observance of the tr=
uce. Disappointed in the hope of a general and lasting treaty, he presumed =
to save his country without the consent of the emperor or the exarch. The s=
word of the enemy was suspended over Rome: it was averted by the mild eloqu=

ious report that Bahram had privately retained the most precious fruits of =
his Turkish victory. But the approach of a Roman army on the side of the Ar=
axes compelled the implacable tyrant to smile and to applaud; and the toils=
 of Bahram were rewarded with the permission of encountering a new enemy, b=

ted by his recent success, he despatched an herald with a bold defiance to =
the camp of the Romans, requesting them to fix a day of battle, and to choo=
se whether they would pass the river themselves or allow a free passage to =
the arms of the Great King. The lieutenant of the emperor Maurice preferred=
 the safer alternative, and this local circumstance, which would have enhan=
ced the victory of the Persians, rendered their defeat more bloody and thei=
r escape more difficult. But the loss of his subjects and the danger of his=
 kingdom were overbalanced in the mind of Hormouz by the disgrace of his pe=

an he received from a royal messenger the insulting gift of a distaff, a sp=
inning-wheel, and a complete suit of female apparel. Obedient to the will o=
f his sovereign, he shewed himself to the soldiers in this unworthy disguis=
e; they resented his ignominy and their own; a shout of rebellion ran throu=
gh the ranks; and the general accepted their oath of fidelity and vows of r=
evenge. A second messenger, who had been commanded to bring the rebel in ch=

gently circulated, exhorting the Persians to assert their freedom against a=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_318">As the passes were faithfully guarded, Hormouz=
 could only compute the number of his enemies by the testimony of a guilty =
conscience, and the daily defection of those who, in the hour of his distre=
ss, avenged their wrongs or forgot their obligations. He proudly displayed =
the ensigns of royalty; but the city and palace of Modain had already escap=
ed from the hand of the tyrant. Among the victims of his cruelty, Bindoes, =
a Sassanian prince, had been cast into a dungeon; his fetters were broken b=
y the zeal and courage of a brother; and he stood before the king at the he=
ad of those trusty guards who had been chosen as the ministers of his confi=
nement and perhaps of his death. Alarmed by the hasty intrusion and bold re=
proaches of the captive, Hormouz looked round, but in vain, for advice or a=
ssistance; discovered that his strength consisted in the obedience of other=
s, and patiently yielded to the single arm of Bindoes, who dragged him from=
 the throne to the same dungeon in which he himself had been so lately conf=
ined. At the first tumult, Chosroes, the eldest of the sons of Hormouz, esc=
aped from the city; he was persuaded to return by the pressing and friendly=
 invitation of Bindoes, who promised to seat him on his father=E2=80=99s th=
rone, and who expected to reign under the name of an inexperienced youth. I=
n the just assurance that his accomplices could neither forgive nor hope to=
 be forgiven, and that every Persian might be trusted as the judge and enem=
y of the tyrant, he instituted a public trial without a precedent and witho=
ut a copy in the annals of the East. The son of Nushirvan, who had requeste=

lid appearance of the prisoner, his tears, his chains, and the marks of ign=
ominious stripes, it was impossible to forget how recently they had adored =
the divine splendour of his diadem and purple. But an angry murmur arose in=
 the assembly as soon as he presumed to vindicate his conduct and to applau=
d the victories of his reign. He defined the duties of a king, and the Pers=
ian nobles listened with a smile of contempt; they were fired with indignat=
ion when he dared to vilify the character of Chosroes; and by the indiscree=
t offer of resigning the sceptre to the second of his sons he subscribed hi=
s own condemnation and sacrificed the life of his innocent favourite. The m=
angled bodies of the boy and his mother were exposed to the people; the eye=
s of Hormouz were pierced with a hot needle; and the punishment of the fath=
er was succeeded by the coronation of his eldest son. Chosroes had ascended=
 the throne without guilt, and his piety strove to alleviate the misery of =
the abdicated monarch; from the dungeon he removed Hormouz to an apartment =
of the palace, supplied with liberality the consolations of sensual enjoyme=

less arduous than it might appear. Persia had already repented of her fatal=
 rashness, which betrayed the heir of the house of Sassan to the ambition o=

, it was easy for him to dissemble his own motions and to prevent those of =
the enemy. In the camp of Issus the Roman general reformed the sloth and di=
sorder of the veterans, and educated the new recruits in the knowledge and =
practice of military virtue. Unfolding the miraculous image of Christ, he u=

worshippers of fire; addressing them by the endearing appellations of sons =
and brethren, he deplored the public and private wrongs of the republic. Th=

</span> and a similar enthusiasm was communicated to the foreign mercenarie=
s, who must have viewed with equal indifference the interest of Rome and of=
 Persia. Heraclius himself, with the skill and patience of a centurion, inc=
ulcated the lessons of the school of tactics, and the soldiers were assiduo=
usly trained in the use of their weapons and the exercises and evolutions o=
f the field. The cavalry and infantry in light or heavy armour were divided=
 into two parties; the trumpets were fixed in the centre, and their signals=
 directed the march, the charge, the retreat, or pursuit; the direct or obl=
ique order, the deep or extended phalanx; to represent in fictitious combat=
 the operations of genuine war. Whatever hardship the emperor imposed on th=
e troops, he inflicted with equal severity on himself; their labour, their =
diet, their sleep, were measured by the inflexible rules of discipline; and=
, without despising the enemy, they were taught to repose an implicit confi=
dence in their own valour and the wisdom of their leader. Cilicia was soon =
encompassed with the Persian arms; but their cavalry hesitated to enter the=
 defiles of Mount Taurus, till they were circumvented by the evolutions of =
Heraclius, who insensibly gained their rear, whilst he appeared to present =
his front in order of battle. By a false motion, which seemed to threaten A=
rmenia, he drew them against their wishes to a general action. They were te=
mpted by the artful disorder of his camp; but, when they advanced to combat=

 to the Barbarians; the Romans successfully repeated their tactics in a fie=

as they relate the conception of Mary, the birth of Christ, and the thirty =
years that preceded the exercise of his ministry. He first appeared on the =

 and not a substance: an human figure created by the hand of Omnipotence to=
 imitate the faculties and actions of a man and to impose a perpetual illus=
ion on the senses of his friends and enemies. Articulate sounds vibrated on=
 the ears of the disciples; but the image which was impressed on their opti=
c nerve eluded the more stubborn evidence of the touch, and they enjoyed th=
e spiritual, not the corporeal, presence of the Son of God. The rage of the=
 Jews was idly wasted against an impassive phantom; and the mystic scenes o=
f the passion and death, the resurrection and ascension of Christ, were rep=
resented on the theatre of Jerusalem for the benefit of mankind. If it were=
 urged that such ideal mimicry, such incessant deception, was unworthy of t=
he God of truth, the Docetes agreed with too many of their orthodox brethre=
n in the justification of pious falsehood. In the system of the Gnostics, t=

 at least an ignorant, spirit. The Son of God descended upon earth to aboli=
sh his temple and his law; and, for the accomplishment of this salutary end=
, he dexterously transferred to his own person the hope and prediction of a=
 temporal Messiah.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_346">One of the most subtle disputants of the Manic=
h=C3=A6an school has pressed the danger and indecency of supposing that the=
 God of the Christians, in the state of an human f=C5=93tus, emerged at the=
 end of nine months from a female womb. The pious horror of his antagonists=
 provoked them to disclaim all sensual circumstances of conception and deli=
very; to maintain that the divinity passed through Mary like a <span class=

ined unbroken even at the moment when she became the mother of Christ. But =
the rashness of these concessions has encouraged a milder sentiment of thos=
e of the Docetes, who taught, not that Christ was a phantom, but that he wa=
s clothed with an impassible and incorruptible body. Such, indeed, in the m=
ore orthodox system, he has acquired since his resurrection, and such he mu=
st have always possessed, if it were capable of pervading, without resistan=
ce or injury, the density of intermediate matter. Devoid of its most essent=
ial properties, it might be exempt from the attributes and infirmities of t=
he flesh. A f=C5=93tus that could increase from an invisible point to its f=
ull maturity, a child that could attain the stature of perfect manhood, wit=
hout deriving any nourishment from the ordinary sources, might continue to =
exist without repairing a daily waste by a daily supply of external matter.=
 Jesus might share the repasts of his disciples without being subject to th=
e calls of thirst or hunger; and his virgin purity was never sullied by the=
 involuntary stains of sensual concupiscence. Of a body thus singularly con=
stituted, a question would arise, by what means, and of what materials, it =
was originally framed; and our sounder theology is startled by an answer wh=
ich was not peculiar to the Gnostics, that both the form and the substance =
proceeded from the divine essence. The idea of pure and absolute spirit is =
a refinement of modern philosophy; the incorporeal essence, ascribed by the=
 ancients to human souls, celestial beings, and even the Deity himself, doe=
s not exclude the notion of extended space; and their imagination was satis=
fied with a subtle nature of air, or fire, or =C3=A6ther, incomparably more=
 perfect than the grossness of the material world. If we define the place, =
we must describe the figure, of the Deity. Our experience, perhaps our vani=

>18</a> bishop of Laodicea, and one of the luminaries of the church. The so=
n of a learned grammarian, he was skilled in all the sciences of Greece; el=
oquence, erudition, and philosophy, conspicuous in the volumes of Apollinar=
is, were humbly devoted to the service of religion. The worthy friend of At=
hanasius, the worthy antagonist of Julian, he bravely wrestled with the Ari=
ans and Polytheists, and, though he affected the rigour of geometrical demo=
nstration, his commentaries revealed the literal and allegorical sense of t=
he scriptures. A mystery which had long floated in the looseness of popular=
 belief was defined by his perverse diligence in a technical form; and he f=
irst proclaimed the memorable words, =E2=80=9COne incarnate nature of Chris=
t,=E2=80=9D which are still re-echoed with hostile clamours in the churches=
 of Asia, Egypt, and =C3=86thiopia. He taught that the Godhead was united o=
r mingled with the body of a man; and that the <i>Logos,</i> the eternal wi=
sdom, supplied in the flesh the place and office of an human soul. Yet, as =
the profound doctor had been terrified at his own rashness, Apollinaris was=
 heard to mutter some faint accents of excuse and explanation. He acquiesce=
d in the old distinction of the Greek philosophers between the rational and=
 sensitive soul of man; that he might reserve the <i>Logos</i> for intellec=
tual functions, and employ the subordinate human principle in the meaner ac=
tions <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page:=

</span> of animal life. With the moderate Docetes, he revered Mary as the s=
piritual, rather than as the carnal, mother of Christ, whose body either ca=
me from heaven, impassible and incorruptible, or was absorbed, and as it we=
re transformed, into the essence of the Deity. The system of Apollinaris wa=
s strenuously encountered by the Asiatic and Syrian divines, whose schools =
are honoured by the names of Basil, Gregory, and Chrysostom, and tainted by=
 those of Diodorus, Theodore, and Nestorius. But the person of the aged bis=
hop of Laodicea, his character and dignity, remained inviolate; and his riv=
als, since we may not suspect them of the weakness of toleration, were asto=
nished, perhaps, by the novelty of the argument, and diffident of the final=
 sentence of the Catholic church. Her judgment at length inclined in their =
favour; the heresy of Apollinaris was condemned, and the separate congregat=
ions of his disciples were proscribed by the Imperial laws. But his princip=
les were secretly entertained in the monasteries of Egypt, and his enemies =
felt the hatred of Theophilus and Cyril, the successive patriarchs of Alexa=
ndria.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_349">V. The grovelling Ebionite and the fantastic D=
ocetes were rejected and forgotten; the recent zeal against the errors of A=
pollinaris reduced the Catholics to a seeming agreement with the double nat=
ure of Cerinthus. But, instead of a temporary and occasional alliance, <i>t=
hey</i> established, and <i>we</i> still embrace, the substantial, indissol=
uble, and everlasting union of a perfect God with a perfect man, of the sec=
ond person of the trinity with a reasonable soul and human flesh. In the be=
ginning of the fifth century, the <i>unity</i> of the <i>two natures</i> wa=
s the prevailing doctrine of the church. On all sides it was confessed that=
 the mode of their co-existence could neither be represented by our ideas n=
or expressed by our language. Yet a secret and incurable discord was cheris=
hed between those who were most apprehensive of confounding, and those who =
were most fearful of separating, the divinity and the humanity of Christ. I=
mpelled by religious frenzy, they fled with adverse haste from the error <s=
pan class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span>=
<span class=3D"bracket">[</span>135<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> =

er hand they were anxious to guard, they were jealous to defend, the union =
and the distinction of the two natures, and to invent such forms of speech,=
 such symbols of doctrine, as were least susceptible of doubt or ambiguity.=
 The poverty of ideas and language tempted them to ransack art and nature f=
or every possible comparison, and each comparison misled their fancy in the=
 explanation of an incomparable mystery. In the polemic microscope an atom =
is enlarged to a monster, and each party was skilful to exaggerate the absu=
rd or impious conclusions that might be extorted from the principles of the=
ir adversaries. To escape from each other, they wandered through many a dar=
k and devious thicket, till they were astonished by the horrid phantoms of =
Cerinthus and Apollinaris, who guarded the opposite issues of the theologic=
al labyrinth. As soon as they beheld the twilight of sense and heresy, they=
 started, measured back their steps, and were again involved in the gloom o=
f impenetrable orthodoxy. To purge themselves from the guilt or reproach of=
 damnable error, they disavowed their consequences, explained their princip=
les, excused their indiscretions, and unanimously pronounced the sounds of =
concord and faith. Yet a latent and almost invisible spark still lurked amo=

 and a long prescription of seven hundred years since the foundation of Ale=
xandria. Without any legal sentence, without any royal mandate, the patriar=
ch, at the dawn of day, led a seditious multitude to the attack of the syna=
gogues. Unarmed and unprepared, the Jews were incapable of resistance; thei=

 the city the remnant of the unbelieving nation. Perhaps he might plead the=

 The zeal of Cyril exposed him to the penalties of the Julian law; but in a=
 feeble government and a superstitious age he was secure of impunity, and e=

 forgotten by the ministers of Theodosius, and too deeply remembered by a p=
riest who affected to pardon, and continued to hate, the prefect of Egypt. =
As he passed through the streets, his chariot was assaulted by a band of fi=

e desert; his protestations that he was a Christian and a Catholic were ans=
wered by a volley of stones, and the face of Orestes was covered with blood=
. The loyal citizens of Alexandria hastened to his rescue; he instantly sat=
isfied his justice and revenge against the monk by whose hand he had been w=
ounded, and Ammonius expired under the rod of the lictor. At the command of=
 Cyril, his body was raised from the ground and transported in solemn proce=
ssion to the cathedral; the name of Ammonius was changed to that of Thaumas=
ius the <i>wonderful;</i> his tomb was decorated with the trophies of marty=

by the synod of Ephesus; his authority, and that of the Latin church, was i=

 provincial synod annulled the irregular proceedings of Ephesus; but, as th=

 and unity of the church. But the pageant of Oriental royalty was moved wit=

 speedily assembled at Nice in Bithynia; his legates required in a perempto=

 to Chalcedon under the immediate eye of Marcian and the senate of Constant=

he rank of a goddess. When her image was first presented to the disciples o=
f St. Thomas, they indignantly exclaimed, =E2=80=9CWe are Christians, not i=
dolaters!=E2=80=9D and their simple devotion was content with the veneratio=
n of the cross. Their separation from the Western world had left them in ig=
norance of the improvements, or corruptions, of a thousand years; and their=
 conformity with the faith and practice of the fifth century would equally =
disappoint the prejudices of a Papist or a Protestant. It was the first car=
e of the ministers of Rome to intercept all correspondence with the Nestori=
an patriarch, and several of his bishops expired in the prisons of the holy=
 office. The flock, without a shepherd, was assaulted by the power of the P=
ortuguese, the arts of the Jesuits, and the zeal of Alexis de Menezes, arch=
bishop of Goa, in his personal visitation of the coast of Malabar. The syno=
d of Diamper, at which he presided, consummated the pious work of the reuni=
on, and rigorously imposed the doctrine and discipline of the Roman church,=
 without forgetting auricular confession, the strongest engine of ecclesias=
tical torture. The memory of Theodore and Nestorius was condemned, and Mala=
bar was reduced under the dominion of the pope, of the primate, and of the =
Jesuits who invaded the see of Angamala or Cranganor. Sixty years of servit=

pire was shaken by the courage and industry of the Dutch, the Nestorians as=
serted, with vigour and effect, the religion of their fathers. The Jesuits =
were incapable of defending the power which they had abused; the arms of fo=

 Indian archdeacon assumed the character of bishop, till a fresh supply of =

inflamed the ferment of Alexandria; and, after a schism of one hundred and =
seventy years, the <i>Gaianites</i> still revered the memory and doctrine o=
f their founder. The strength of numbers and of discipline was tried in a d=
esperate and bloody conflict; the streets were filled with the dead bodies =
of citizens and soldiers; the pious women, ascending the roofs of their hou=
ses, showered down every sharp or ponderous utensil on the heads of the ene=

 had not conquered in the cause of an heretic; Theodosius himself was speed=
ily, though gently, removed; and Paul of Tanis, an orthodox monk, was raise=
d to the throne of Athanasius. The powers of government were strained in hi=

, with a bribe of seven hundred pounds of gold, his restoration to the same=

of Jacobites and the communion of the faith. But the same faith, which has =
been confined to a narrow sect of the Syrians, was diffused over the mass o=
f the Egyptian or Coptic nation, who, almost unanimously, rejected the decr=
ees of the synod of Chalcedon. A thousand years were now elapsed since Egyp=
t had ceased to be a kingdom, since the conquerors of Asia and Europe had t=
rampled on the ready necks of a people whose ancient wisdom and power ascen=
ds beyond the records of history. The conflict of zeal and persecution reki=
ndled some sparks of their national spirit. They abjured, with a foreign he=
resy, the manners and language of the Greeks: every Melchite, in their eyes=
, was a stranger, every Jacobite a citizen; the alliance of marriage, the o=
ffices of humanity, were condemned as a deadly sin; the natives renounced a=
ll allegiance to the emperor; and his orders, at a distance from Alexandria=
, were obeyed only under the pressure of military force. A generous effort =
might have redeemed the religion and liberty of Egypt, and her six hundred =
monasteries might have poured forth their myriads of holy warriors, for who=
m death should have no terrors, since life had no comfort or delight. But e=
xperience has proved the distinction of active and passive courage; the fan=
atic who endures without a groan the torture of the rack or the stake would=
 tremble and fly before the face of an armed enemy. The pusillanimous tempe=
r of the Egyptians could only hope for a change of masters; the arms of Cho=
sroes depopulated the land, yet under his reign the Jacobites enjoyed a sho=
rt and precarious respite. The victory of Heraclius renewed and aggravated =
the persecution, and the patriarch again escaped from Alexandria to the des=

patience and dexterity of forty years at length obtained a more favourable =
audience, and two emperors of Abyssinia were persuaded that Rome could ensu=
re the temporal and everlasting happiness of her votaries. The first of the=
se royal converts lost his crown and his life; and the rebel army was sanct=
ified by the <i>abuna,</i> who hurled an anathema at the apostate, and abso=

venged by the courage and fortune of Susneus, who ascended the throne under=
 the name of Segued, and more vigorously prosecuted the pious enterprise of=
 his kinsman. After the amusement of some unequal combats between the Jesui=
ts and his illiterate priests, the emperor declared himself a proselyte to =
the synod of Chalcedon, presuming that his clergy and people would embrace =
without delay the religion of their prince. The liberty of choice was succe=
eded by a law which imposed, under pain of death, the belief of the two nat=
ures of Christ: the Abyssinians were enjoined to work and to play on the Sa=
bbath; and Segued, in the face of Europe and Africa, renounced his connecti=
on with the Alexandrian church. A Jesuit, Alphonso Mendez, the Catholic pat=
riarch of =C3=86thiopia, accepted in the name of Urban VIII. the homage and=
 abjuration of his penitent. =E2=80=9CI confess,=E2=80=9D said the emperor =

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_382"><span class=3D"csc">I have</span> now deduced =
from Trajan to Constantine, from Constantine to Heraclius, the regular seri=
es of the Roman emperors; and faithfully exposed the prosperous and adverse=
 fortunes of their reigns. Five centuries of the decline and fall of the em=
pire have already elapsed; but a period of more than eight hundred years st=
ill separates me from the term of my labours, the taking of Constantinople =
by the Turks. Should I persevere in the same course, should I observe the s=
ame measure, a prolix and slender thread would be spun through many a volum=
e, nor would the patient reader find an adequate reward of instruction or a=
musement. At every step, as we sink deeper in the decline and fall of the E=
astern empire, the annals of each succeeding reign would impose a more ungr=
ateful and melancholy task. These annals must continue to repeat a tedious =
and uniform tale of weakness and misery; the natural connection of causes a=
nd events would be broken by frequent and hasty transitions, and a minute a=
ccumulation of circumstances must destroy the light and effect of those gen=
eral pictures which compose the use and ornament of a remote history. From =
the time of Heraclius, the Byzantine theatre is contracted and darkened; th=
e line of empire, which had been defined by the laws of Justinian and the a=
rms of Belisarius, recedes on all sides from our view; the Roman name, the =
proper subject of our inquiries, is reduced to a narrow corner of Europe, t=
o the lonely suburbs of Constantinople; and the fate of the Greek empire ha=
s been compared <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: curr=
ent; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>216<span class=3D"bracket=
">]</span></span> to that of the Rhine, which loses itself in the sands bef=
ore its waters can mingle with the ocean. The scale of dominion is diminish=
ed to our view by the distance of time and place; nor is the loss of extern=
al splendour compensated by the nobler gifts of virtue and genius. In the l=
ast moments of her decay, Constantinople was doubtless more opulent and pop=
ulous than Athens at her most flourishing era, when a scanty sum of six tho=
usand talents, or twelve hundred thousand pounds sterling, was possessed by=
 twenty-one thousand male citizens of an adult age. But each of these citiz=
ens was a freeman, who dared to assert the liberty of his thoughts, words, =
and actions; whose person and property were guarded by equal law; and who e=
xercised his independent vote in the government of the republic. Their numb=
ers seem to be multiplied by the strong and various discriminations of char=
acter: under the shield of freedom, on the wings of emulation and vanity, e=
ach Athenian aspired to the level of the national dignity; from this comman=
ding eminence some chosen spirits soared beyond the reach of a vulgar eye; =
and the chances of superior merit in a great and populous kingdom, as they =
are proved by experience, would excuse the computation of imaginary million=
s. The territories of Athens, Sparta, and their allies do not exceed a mode=
rate province of France or England; but, after the trophies of Salamis and =
Plat=C3=A6a, they expand in our fancy to the gigantic size of Asia, which h=
ad been trampled under the feet of the victorious Greeks. But the subjects =
of the Byzantine empire, who assume and dishonour the names both of Greeks =
and Romans, present a dead uniformity of abject vices, which are neither so=
ftened by the weakness of humanity nor animated by the vigour of memorable =
crimes. The freemen of antiquity might repeat, with generous enthusiasm, th=
e sentence of Homer, =E2=80=9Cthat, on the first day of his servitude, the =
captive is deprived of one half of his manly virtue.=E2=80=9D But the poet =
had only seen the effects of civil or domestic slavery, nor could he forete=
ll that the second moiety of manhood must be annihilated by the spiritual d=
espotism <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Pa=
ge: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>217<span class=3D"bracket">]</sp=
an></span> which shackles not only the actions but even the thoughts of the=
 prostrate votary. By this double yoke, the Greeks were oppressed under the=
 successors of Heraclius; the tyrant, a law of eternal justice, was degrade=
d by the vices of his subjects; and on the throne, in the camp, in the scho=
ols, we search, perhaps with fruitless diligence, the names and characters =
that may deserve to be rescued from oblivion. Nor are the defects of the su=
bject compensated by the skill and variety of the painters. Of a space of e=
ight hundred years, the four first centuries are overspread with a cloud, i=
nterrupted by some faint and broken rays of historic light; in the lives of=
 the emperors, from Maurice to Alexius, Basil the Macedonian has alone been=
 the theme of a separate work; and the absence, or loss, or imperfection of=
 contemporary evidence must be poorly supplied by the doubtful authority of=
 more recent compilers. The four last centuries are exempt from the reproac=
h of penury; and with the Comnenian family the historic muse of Constantino=
ple again revives, but her apparel is gaudy, her motions are without elegan=
ce or grace. A succession of priests, or courtiers, treads in each other=E2=
=80=99s footsteps in the same path of servitude and superstition: their vie=
ws are narrow, their judgment is feeble or corrupt; and we close the volume=
 of copious barrenness, still ignorant of the causes of events, the charact=
ers of the actors, and the manners of the times, which they celebrate or de=
plore. The observation which has been applied to a man may be extended to a=
 whole people, that the energy of the sword is communicated to the pen; and=
 it will be found, by experience, that the tone of history will rise or fal=
l with the spirit of the age.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_383">From these considerations, I should have aband=
oned, without regret, the Greek slaves and their servile historians, had I =
not reflected that the fate of the Byzantine monarchy is <i>passively</i> c=
onnected with the most splendid and important revolutions which have change=
d the state of the world. The space of the lost provinces was immediately r=
eplenished with new colonies and rising kingdoms; the active virtues of pea=

pan> and war deserted from the vanquished to the victorious nations; and it=
 is in their origin and conquests, in their religion and government, that w=
e must explore the causes and effects of the decline and fall of the Easter=
n empire. Nor will this scope of narrative, the riches and variety of these=
 materials, be incompatible with the unity of design and composition. As, i=
n his daily prayers, the Musulman of Fez or Delhi still turns his face towa=
rds the temple of Mecca, the historian=E2=80=99s eye shall be always fixed =
on the city of Constantinople. The excursive line may embrace the wilds of =
Arabia and Tartary, but the circle will be ultimately reduced to the decrea=
sing limit of the Roman monarchy.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_384">On this principle, I shall now establish the p=
lan of the last two volumes of the present work. The first chapter will con=
tain, in a regular series, the emperors who reigned at Constantinople durin=
g a period of six hundred years, from the days of Heraclius to the Latin co=
nquest: a rapid abstract, which may be supported by a <i>general</i> appeal=
 to the order and text of the original historians. In this introduction, I =
shall confine myself to the revolutions of the throne, the successions of f=
amilies, the personal characters of the Greek princes, the mode of their li=
fe and death, the maxims and influence of their domestic government, and th=
e tendency of their reign to accelerate or suspend the downfall of the East=
ern empire. Such a chronological review will serve to illustrate the variou=
s argument of the subsequent chapters; and each circumstance of the eventfu=
l story of the Barbarians will adapt itself in a proper place to the Byzant=
ine annals. The internal state of the empire, and the dangerous heresy of t=
he Paulicians, which shook the East and enlightened the West, will be the s=
ubject of two separate chapters; but these inquiries must be postponed till=
 our further progress shall have opened the view of the world in the ninth =
and tenth centuries of the Christian era. After this foundation of Byzantin=
e history, the following nations will pass before our eyes, and each will o=
ccupy the space to which it may be entitled by greatness or <span class=3D"=

he Barbarians of France, Italy, and Germany, who were united by the sword a=

on of the Roman empire in the West. II. The <span class=3D"csc">Arabs</span=
> or <span class=3D"csc">Saracens.</span> Three ample chapters will be devo=
ted to this curious and interesting object. In the first, after a picture o=
f the country and its inhabitants, I shall investigate the character of Mah=
omet; the character, religion, and success of the prophet. In the second, I=
 shall lead the Arabs to the conquest of Syria, Egypt, and Africa, the prov=
inces of the Roman empire; nor can I check their victorious career till the=
y have overthrown the monarchies of Persia and Spain. In the third, I shall=
 inquire how Constantinople and Europe were saved by the luxury and arts, t=
he division and decay, of the empire of the caliphs. A single chapter will =
include, III. The <span class=3D"csc">Bulgarians,</span> IV. <span class=3D=
"csc">Hungarians,</span> and V. <span class=3D"csc">Russians,</span> who as=
saulted by sea or by land the provinces and the capital; but the last of th=
ese, so important in their present greatness, will excite some curiosity in=
 their origin and infancy. VI. The <span class=3D"csc">Normans;</span> or r=
ather the private adventurers of that warlike people, who founded a powerfu=
l kingdom in Apulia and Sicily, shook the throne of Constantinople, display=
ed the trophies of chivalry, and almost realised the wonders of romance. VI=
I. The <span class=3D"csc">Latins;</span> the subjects of the pope, the nat=
ions of the West, who enlisted under the banner of the Cross, for the recov=
ery or relief of the holy sepulchre. The Greek emperors were terrified and =
preserved by the myriads of pilgrims who marched to Jerusalem with Godfrey =
of Bouillon and the peers of Christendom. The second and third crusades tro=
d in the footsteps of the first: Asia and Europe were mingled in a sacred w=
ar of two hundred years; and the Christian powers were bravely resisted, an=
d finally expelled, by Saladin and the Mamalukes <span class=3D"pb"><span c=
lass=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">=
[</span>220<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> of Egypt. In these memor=
able crusades, a fleet and army of French and Venetians were diverted from =
Syria to the Thracian Bosphorus; they assaulted the capital, they subverted=
 the Greek monarchy; and a dynasty of Latin princes was seated near threesc=
ore years on the throne of Constantine. VIII. The <span class=3D"csc">Greek=
s</span> themselves, during this period of captivity and exile, must be con=
sidered as a foreign nation, the enemies, and again the sovereigns, of Cons=
tantinople. Misfortune had rekindled a spark of national virtue; and the Im=
perial series may be continued, with some dignity, from their restoration t=
o the Turkish conquest. IX. The <span class=3D"csc">Moguls</span> and <span=
 class=3D"csc">Tartars.</span> By the arms of Zingis and his descendants th=
e globe was shaken from China to Poland and Greece; the Sultans were overth=
rown; the caliphs fell; and the C=C3=A6sars trembled on their throne. The v=
ictories of Timour suspended, above fifty years, the final ruin of the Byza=
ntine empire. X. I have already noticed the first appearance of the <span c=
lass=3D"csc">Turks;</span> and the names of the fathers, of <i>Seljuk</i> a=
nd <i>Othman,</i> discriminate the two successive dynasties of the nation w=
hich emerged in the eleventh century from the Scythian wilderness. The form=

Antioch and Nice; and the first crusade was provoked by the violation of Je=
rusalem and the danger of Constantinople. From an humble origin, the <i>Ott=
omans</i> arose, the scourge and terror of Christendom. Constantinople was =
besieged and taken by Mahomet II., and his triumph annihilates the remnant,=
 the image, the title, of the Roman empire in the East. The schism of the G=
reeks will be connected with their last calamities, and the restoration of =
learning in the Western world. I shall return from the captivity of the new=

 the name and attributes of royalty, she was checked by a firm, though resp=

ath of superstitious prejudice. =E2=80=9CWe reverence,=E2=80=9D exclaimed t=

laves of Persia!=E2=80=9D Martina descended from the throne with indignatio=
n, and sought a refuge in the female apartment of the palace. The reign of =
Constantine the Third lasted only one hundred and three days; he expired in=
 the thirtieth year of his age, and, although his life had been a long mala=
dy, a belief was entertained that poison had been the means, and his cruel =
step-mother the author, of his untimely fate. Martina reaped, indeed, the h=
arvest of his death, and assumed the government in the name of the survivin=

the jealousy of the people was awakened; and the two orphans, whom Constant=

declare himself the guardian of his nephews, one of whom he had presented a=

 demanded the punishment of the assassins and the restoration of the lawful=
 heir. The licence of the soldiers, who devoured the grapes and drank the w=
ine of their Asiatic vineyards, provoked the citizens of Constantinople aga=
inst the domestic authors of their calamities, and the dome of St. Sophia r=
e-echoed, not with prayers and hymns, but with the clamours and imprecation=
s of an enraged multitude. At their imperious command, Heracleonas appeared=
 in the pulpit with the eldest of the royal orphans; Constans alone was sal=
uted as emperor of the Romans; and a crown of gold, which had been taken fr=
om the tomb of Heraclius, was placed on his head, with the solemn benedicti=
on of the patriarch. But in the tumult of joy and indignation the church wa=
s pillaged, the sanctuary was polluted by a promiscuous crowd of Jews and B=
arbarians; and the Monothelite Pyrrhus, a creature of the empress, after dr=
opping a protestation on the altar, escaped by a prudent flight from the ze=
al of the Catholics. A more serious and bloody task was reserved for the se=
nate, who derived a temporary strength from the consent of the soldiers and=
 people. The spirit of Roman freedom revived the ancient and awful examples=
 of the judgment of tyrants, and the Imperial culprits were deposed and con=
demned as the authors of the death of Constantine. But the severity of the =
conscript fathers was stained by the indiscriminate punishment of the innoc=
ent and the guilty: Martina and Heracleonas were sentenced to the amputatio=
n, the former of her tongue, the latter of his nose; and after this cruel e=
xecution they consumed the remainder of their days in exile and oblivion. T=

 with a sigh, that he was a victim adorned for sacrifice and that inevitabl=

 men abhorred the reign of a monster; and that the hands of two hundred tho=

 to be burnt alive in the furnace of the private baths. The devout humanity=
 of the empress Theophano was fatal to her husband and family. A solemn day=
, the twenty-fifth of December, had been fixed for the execution; she urged=
 that the anniversary of the Saviour=E2=80=99s birth would be profaned by t=
his inhuman spectacle, and Leo consented with reluctance to a decent respit=

t, at the dead of night, the chamber in which his enemy was confined; he be=
held him released from his chain, and stretched on his gaoler=E2=80=99s bed=
 in a profound slumber. Leo was alarmed at these signs of security and inte=
lligence; but, though he retired with silent steps, his entrance and depart=
ure were noticed by a slave who lay concealed in a corner of the prison. Un=
der the pretence of requesting the spiritual aid of a confessor, Michael in=
formed the conspirators that their lives depended on his discretion, and th=
at a few hours were left to assure their own safety by the deliverance of t=
heir friend and country. On the great festivals, a chosen band of priests a=
nd chanters was admitted into the palace, by a private gate, to sing matins=
 in the chapel; and Leo, who regulated with the same strictness the discipl=
ine of the choir and of the camp, was seldom absent from those early devoti=
ons. In the ecclesiastical habit, but with swords under their robes, the co=
nspirators mingled with the procession, lurked in the angles of the chapel,=
 and expected, as the signal of murder, the intonation of the first psalm b=
y the emperor himself. The imperfect light, and the uniformity of dress, mi=
ght have favoured his escape, while their assault was pointed against an ha=
rmless priest; but they soon discovered their mistake, and encompassed on a=

class=3D"bracket">[</span>250<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> were c=
oncluded by a signal overthrow; Amorium, the native city of his ancestors, =
was levelled with the ground, and from his military toils he derived only t=
he surname of the Unfortunate. The wisdom of a sovereign is comprised in th=
e institution of laws and the choice of magistrates, and, while he seems wi=
thout action, his civil government revolves round his centre with the silen=
ce and order of the planetary system. But the justice of Theophilus was fas=
hioned on the model of the Oriental despots, who, in personal and irregular=
 acts of authority, consult the reason or passion of the moment, without me=
asuring the sentence by the law or the penalty by the offence. A poor woman=
 threw herself at the emperor=E2=80=99s feet, to complain of a powerful nei=
ghbour, the brother of the empress, who had raised his palace-wall to such =
an inconvenient height that her humble dwelling was excluded from light and=
 air! On the proof of the fact, instead of granting, like an ordinary judge=
, sufficient or ample damages to the plaintiff, the sovereign adjudged to h=
er use and benefit the palace and the ground. Nor was Theophilus content wi=
th this extravagant satisfaction: his zeal converted a civil trespass into =
a criminal act; and the unfortunate patrician was stripped and scourged in =
the public place of Constantinople. For some venial offences, some defect o=
f equity or vigilance, the principal ministers, a prefect, a qu=C3=A6stor, =
a captain of the guards, were banished or mutilated, or scalded with boilin=
g pitch, or burnt alive in the hippodrome; and, as these dreadful examples =
might be the effects of error or caprice, they must have alienated from his=
 service the best and wisest of the citizens. But the pride of the monarch =
was flattered in the exercise of power, or, as he thought, of virtue; and t=
he people, safe in their obscurity, applauded the danger and debasement of =
their superiors. This extraordinary rigour was justified, in some measure, =
by its salutary consequences; since, after a scrutiny of seventeen days, no=
t a complaint or abuse could be found in the court or city; and it might be=
 alleged that the Greeks could be ruled only with a rod of <span class=3D"p=
b"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D=
"bracket">[</span>251<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> iron, and that=
 the public interest is the motive and law of the supreme judge. Yet in the=
 crime, or the suspicion, of treason, that judge is of all others the most =
credulous and partial. Theophilus might inflict a tardy vengeance on the as=
sassins of Leo and the saviours of his father; but he enjoyed the fruits of=
 their crime; and his jealous tyranny sacrificed a brother and a prince to =
the future safety of his life. A Persian of the race of the Sassanides died=
 in poverty and exile at Constantinople, leaving an only son, the issue of =
a plebeian marriage. At the age of twelve years, the royal birth of Theopho=
bus was revealed, and his merit was not unworthy of his birth. He was educa=
ted in the Byzantine palace, a Christian and a soldier; advanced with rapid=
 steps in the career of fortune and glory; received the hand of the emperor=
=E2=80=99s sister; and was promoted to the command of thirty thousand Persi=
ans, who, like his father, had fled from the Mahometan conquerors. These tr=
oops, doubly infected with mercenary and fanatic vices, were desirous of re=
volting against their benefactor and erecting the standard of their native =
king; but the loyal Theophobus rejected their offers, disconcerted their sc=
hemes, and escaped from their hands to the camp or palace of his royal brot=
her. A generous confidence might have secured a faithful and able guardian =
for his wife and his infant son, to whom Theophilus, in the flower of his a=
ge, was compelled to leave the inheritance of the empire. But his jealousy =
was exasperated by envy and disease; he feared the dangerous virtues which =
might either support or oppress their infancy and weakness; and the dying e=
mperor demanded the head of the Persian prince. With savage delight, he rec=
ognised the familiar features of his brother: =E2=80=9CThou art no longer T=
heophobus,=E2=80=9D he said; and sinking on his couch he added, with a falt=

e have not hitherto found the imitation of their vices, the character of a =
Roman prince who considered pleasure as the object of life and virtue as th=

 in the education of Michael the Third, her unfortunate son was a king befo=
re he was a man. If the ambitious mother laboured to check the progress of =
reason, she could not cool the ebullition of passion; and her selfish polic=
y was justly repaid by the contempt and ingratitude of the headstrong youth=
. At the age of eighteen, he rejected her authority, without feeling his ow=
n incapacity to govern the empire and himself. With Theodora, all gravity a=

 dominion of vice and <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition=

tate were lavished on the vilest of men, who flattered his passions and sha=
red his pleasures; and, in a reign of thirteen years, the richest of sovere=
igns was compelled to strip the palace and the churches of their precious f=
urniture. Like Nero, he delighted in the amusements of the theatre, and sig=
hed to be surpassed in the accomplishments in which he should have blushed =
to excel. Yet the studies of Nero in music and poetry betrayed some symptom=
s of a liberal taste; the more ignoble arts of the son of Theophilus were c=
onfined to the chariot-race of the hippodrome. The four factions which had =
agitated the peace, still amused the idleness, of the capital; for himself,=
 the emperor assumed the blue livery; the three rival colours were distribu=

 the most sanguinary commands; and, if any feelings of humanity were left, =
he was reduced, with the return of sense, to approve the salutary disobedie=

 Michael is the profane mockery of the religion of his country. The superst=
ition of the Greeks might, indeed, excite the smile of a philosopher; but h=
is smile would have been rational and temperate, and he must have condemned=
 the ignorant folly of a youth who insulted the objects of public veneratio=
n. A buffoon of the court was invested in the robes of the patriarch; his t=
welve metropolitans, among whom the emperor was ranked, assumed their eccle=
siastical garments; they used or abused the sacred vessels of the altar; an=
d in their bacchanalian feasts the holy communion was administered in a nau=
seous compound of vinegar and mustard. Nor were these impious spectacles co=
ncealed from the eyes of the city. On the day of a solemn festival, the emp=
eror, with his bishops or buffoons, rode on asses through the streets, enco=
untered the true patriarch at the head of his clergy, and by their licentio=
us shouts and obscene gestures disordered the gravity of the Christian proc=
ession. The devotion of Michael appeared only in some offence to reason or =
piety; he received his theatrical crowns from the statue of the Virgin; and=
 an Imperial tomb was violated for the sake of burning the bones of Constan=
tine the Iconoclast. By this extravagant conduct, the son of Theophilus bec=
ame as contemptible as he was odious; every citizen was impatient for the d=
eliverance of his country; and even the favourites of the moment were appre=
hensive that a caprice might snatch away what a caprice had bestowed. In th=

neage or country with the Macedonian Alexander. No sooner was he born than =

fetters, marched through Bulgaria to the shores of the Euxine, defeated two=
 armies of Barbarians, embarked in the ships which had been stationed for t=
heir reception, and returned to Constantinople, from whence they were distr=
ibuted to their respective homes. But the freedom of Basil was naked and de=
stitute; his farm was ruined by the calamities of war; after his father=E2=
=80=99s death, his manual labour or service could no longer support a famil=
y of orphans; and he resolved to seek a more conspicuous theatre, in which =
every virtue and every vice may lead to the paths of greatness. The first n=
ight of his arrival at Constantinople, without friends or money, the weary =
pilgrim slept on the steps of the church of St. Diomede; he was fed by the =
casual hospitality of a monk; and was introduced to the service of a cousin=
 and namesake of the emperor Theophilus; who, though himself of a diminutiv=
e person, was always followed by a train of tall and handsome domestics. Ba=
sil attended his patron to the government of Peloponnesus; eclipsed, by his=
 personal merit, the birth and dignity of Theophilus, and formed an useful =
connection with a wealthy and charitable matron of Patras. Her spiritual or=
 carnal love embraced the young adventurer, whom she adopted as her son. Da=
nielis presented him with thirty slaves; and the produce of her bounty was =
expended in the support of his brothers and the purchase of some large esta=
tes in Macedonia. His gratitude or ambition still attached him to the servi=
ce of Theophilus; and a lucky accident recommended him to the notice of the=
 court. A famous wrestler, in the train of the Bulgarian ambassadors, had d=
efied, at the royal banquet, the boldest and most robust of the Greeks. The=

the bloody hand of an assassin the empire which he ruled with the wisdom an=
d tenderness of a parent. A private citizen may feel his interest repugnant=
 to his duty; but it must be from a deficiency of sense or courage that an =
absolute monarch can separate his happiness from his glory or his glory fro=
m the public welfare. The life or panegyric of Basil has, indeed, been comp=
osed and published under the long reign of his descendants; but even their =
stability on the throne may be justly ascribed to the superior merit of the=
ir ancestor. In his character, his grandson Constantine has attempted to de=

opied a real model, could not easily have soared so high above the level of=
 his own conduct or conceptions. But the most solid praise of Basil is draw=

 wrested from the dissolute Michael, and that which he bequeathed to the Ma=
cedonian dynasty. The evils which had been sanctified by time and example w=
ere corrected by his master-hand; and he revived, if not the national spiri=

indefatigable, his temper cool, his understanding vigorous and decisive; an=

ues each virtue at an equal distance between the opposite vices. His milita=

h the spirit or the talents of a warrior. Yet under his reign the Roman arm=
s were again formidable to the Barbarians. As soon as he had formed a new a=

 it was proposed to resume the lavish and ill-placed gifts of his predecess=
or: his prudence abated one moiety of the restitution; and a sum of twelve =
hundred thousand pounds was instantly procured to answer the most pressing =
demands and to allow some space for the mature operations of economy. Among=
 the various schemes for the improvement of the revenue, a new mode was sug=
gested of capitation, or tribute, which would have too much depended on the=
 arbitrary discretion of the assessors. A sufficient list of honest and abl=

crutiny of Basil himself, only two could be found who might be safely entru=

 his confidence. But the serious and successful diligence of the emperor es=
tablished by degrees an equitable balance of property and payment, of recei=

 public method secured the interest of the prince and the property of the p=

 Bosphorus, landed at the palace stairs, and silently ascended a ladder of =
ropes, which was cast down by the female attendants. Neither his own suspic=

rus from a domestic foe, at whose voice every door was opened to the assass=

 intrusion, and thirty daggers glittered before his eyes. It is doubtful wh=
ether Zimisces imbrued his hands in the blood of his sovereign; but he enjo=
yed the inhuman spectacle of revenge. The murder was protracted by insult a=
nd cruelty; and, as soon as the head of Nicephorus was shewn from the windo=
w, the tumult was hushed and the Armenian was emperor of the East. On the d=
ay of his coronation, he was stopped on the threshold of St. Sophia, by the=
 intrepid patriarch; who charged his conscience with the deed of treason an=
d blood, and required, as a sign of repentance, that he should separate him=
self from his more criminal associate. This sally of apostolic zeal was not=
 offensive to the prince, since he could neither love nor trust a woman who=
 had repeatedly violated the most sacred obligations; and Theophano, instea=
d of sharing his Imperial fortune, was dismissed with ignominy from his bed=

Zoe and Theodora, who were preserved till a mature age in a state of ignora=

 sceptre devolved to Romanus the Third; but his labours at home and abroad =
were equally feeble and fruitless; and the mature age, the forty-eight year=

 the name of Michael, whose first trade had been that of a money-changer; a=

 of Constantinople and Trebizond. The <i>Comneni,</i> who upheld for a whil=

ough honourable dwelling of his fathers. The first of their line was the il=
lustrious Manuel, who, in the reign of the second Basil, contributed by war=
 and treaty to appease the troubles of the East; he left in a tender age tw=
o sons, Isaac and John, whom, with the consciousness of desert, he bequeath=

fully trained in the learning of the monastery, the arts of the palace, and=
 the exercises of the camp; and from the domestic service of the guards the=
y were rapidly promoted to the command of provinces and armies. Their frate=
rnal union doubled the force and reputation of the Comneni, and their ancie=
nt nobility was illustrated by the marriage of the two brothers, with a cap=
tive princess of Bulgaria, and the daughter of a patrician, who had obtaine=
d the name of <i>Charon</i> from the number of enemies whom he had sent to =
the infernal shades. The soldiers had served with reluctant loyalty a serie=
s of effeminate masters; the elevation of Michael the Sixth was a personal =
insult to the more deserving generals; and their discontent was inflamed by=
 the parsimony of the emperor and the insolence of the eunuchs. They secret=
ly assembled in the sanctuary of St. Sophia, and the votes of the military =
synod would have been unanimous in favour of the old and valiant Catacalon,=
 if the patriotism or modesty of the veteran had not suggested the importan=
ce of birth as well as merit in the choice of a sovereign. Isaac Comnenus w=
as approved by general consent, and the associates separated without delay =
to meet in the plains of Phrygia, at the head of their respective squadrons=
 and detachments. The cause of Michael was defended in a single battle by t=
he mercenaries of the Imperial guard, who were aliens to the public interes=

 Ducas, till the young princes were soothed by the tears of their mother an=
d the solemn assurances of the fidelity of their guardian, who filled the I=
mperial station with dignity and honour. Hereafter I shall relate his valia=
nt but unsuccessful efforts to resist the progress of the Turks. His defeat=
 and captivity inflicted a deadly wound on the Byzantine monarchy of the Ea=
st; and, after he was released from the chains of the sultan, he vainly sou=
ght his wife and his subjects. His wife had been thrust into a monastery, a=
nd the subjects of Romanus had embraced the rigid maxim of the civil law th=
at a prisoner in the hands of the enemy is deprived, as by the stroke of de=
ath, of all the public and private rights of a citizen. In the general cons=
ternation the C=C3=A6sar John asserted the indefeasible right of his three =
nephews: Constantinople listened to his voice; and the Turkish captive was =
proclaimed in the capital, and received on the frontier, as an enemy of the=
 republic. Romanus was not more fortunate in domestic than in foreign <span=

: the loss of two battles compelled him to yield, on the assurance of fair =
and honourable treatment; but his enemies were devoid of faith or humanity;=
 and, after the cruel extinction of his sight, his wounds were left to blee=
d and corrupt, till in a few days he was relieved from a state of misery. U=
nder the triple reign of the house of Ducas, the two younger brothers were =
reduced to the vain honours of the purple; but the eldest, the pusillanimou=
s Michael, was incapable of sustaining the Roman sceptre; and his surname o=
f <i>Parapinaces</i> denotes the reproach which he shared with an avariciou=
s favourite who enhanced the price, and diminished the measure, of wheat. I=
n the school of Psellus, and after the example of his mother, the son of Eu=
docia made some proficiency in philosophy and rhetoric; but his character w=
as degraded, rather than ennobled, by the virtues of a monk and the learnin=
g of a sophist. Strong in the contempt of their sovereign and their own est=
eem, two generals at the head of the European and Asiatic legions assumed t=
he purple at Hadrianople and Nice. Their revolt was in the same month; they=
 bore the same name of Nicephorus; but the two candidates were distinguishe=
d by the surnames of Bryennius and Botaniates: the former in the maturity o=
f wisdom and courage, the latter conspicuous only by the memory of his past=
 exploits. While Botaniates advanced with cautious and dilatory steps, his =
active competitor stood in arms before the gates of Constantinople. The nam=
e of Bryennius was illustrious; his cause was popular; but his licentious t=
roops could not be restrained from burning and pillaging a suburb; and the =
people, who would have hailed the rebel, rejected and repulsed the incendia=
ry of his country. This change of the public opinion was favourable to Bota=
niates, who at length, with an army of Turks, approached the shores of Chal=
cedon. A formal invitation, in the name of the patriarch, the synod, and th=
e senate, was circulated through the streets of Constantinople; and the gen=
eral assembly, in the dome of St. Sophia, debated, with order and calmness,=

rsed this unarmed multitude; but the feeble emperor, applauding his own mod=
eration and clemency, resigned the ensigns of royalty, and was rewarded wit=
h the monastic habit and the title of archbishop of Ephesus. He left a son,=
 a Constantine, born and educated in the purple; and a daughter of the hous=
e of Ducas illustrated the blood, and confirmed the succession, of the Comn=

heir numerous forces and military fame; they were successively vanquished i=
n the field, and led in chains to the foot of the throne; and, whatever tre=
atment they might receive from a timid and cruel court, they applauded the =
clemency, as well as the courage, of their conqueror. But the loyalty of th=
e Comneni was soon tainted by fear and suspicion; nor is it easy to settle =
between a subject and a despot the debt of gratitude, which the former is t=
empted to claim by a revolt and the latter to discharge by an executioner. =
The refusal of Alexius to march against a fourth rebel, the husband of his =
sister, destroyed the merit or memory of his past services; the favourites =
of Botaniates provoked the ambition which they apprehended and accused; and=
 the retreat of the two brothers might be justified by the defence of their=
 life or liberty. The women of the family were deposited in a sanctuary, re=
spected by tyrants: the men, mounted on horseback, sallied from the city an=

ssembled in the capital and the neighbourhood, were devoted to the cause of=
 a victorious and injured leader; the ties of common interest and domestic =
alliance secured the attachment of the house of Ducas; and the generous dis=
pute of the Comneni was terminated by the decisive resolution of Isaac, who=
 was the first to invest his younger brother with the name and ensigns of r=
oyalty. They returned to Constantinople, to threaten rather than besiege th=
at impregnable fortress; but the fidelity of the guards was corrupted; a ga=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_417">The life of the emperor Alexius has been delin=
eated by a favourite daughter, who was inspired by a tender regard for his =
person and a laudable zeal to perpetuate his virtues. Conscious of the just=
 suspicion of her readers, the princess Anna Comnena repeatedly protests th=
at, besides her personal knowledge, she had searched the discourse and writ=
ings of the most respectable veterans; that, after an interval of thirty ye=
ars, forgotten by, and forgetful of, the world, her mournful solitude was i=
naccessible to hope and fear; and that truth, the naked perfect truth, was =
more dear and sacred than the memory of her parent. Yet, instead of the sim=
plicity of style and narrative which wins our belief, an elaborate affectat=
ion of rhetoric and science betrays, in every page, the vanity of a female =
author. The genuine character of Alexius is lost in a vague constellation o=
f virtues; and the perpetual strain of panegyric and apology awakens our je=
alousy, to question the veracity of the historian and the merit of the hero=
. We cannot, however, refuse her judicious and important remark that the di=
sorders of the times were the misfortune and the glory of Alexius; and that=
 every calamity which can afflict a declining empire was accumulated on his=
 reign, by the justice of heaven and the vices of his predecessors. In the =
East, the victorious Turks had spread, from Persia to the Hellespont, the r=
eign of the Koran and the Crescent; the West was invaded by the adventurous=
 valour of the Normans; and, in the moments of peace, the Danube poured for=
th new swarms, who had gained, in the science of war, what they had lost in=
 the ferociousness of manners. The sea was not less hostile than the land; =
and, while the frontiers were assaulted by an open enemy, the palace was di=
stracted with secret treason and conspiracy. On a sudden, the banner of the=
 Cross was displayed by the Latins: Europe was precipitated on Asia; and Co=
nstantinople had almost been swept away by this impetuous deluge. In the te=
mpest Alexius steered the <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edi=
tion: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>288<span class=
=3D"bracket">]</span></span> Imperial vessel with dexterity and courage. At=
 the head of his armies he was bold in action, skilful in stratagem, patien=
t of fatigue, ready to improve his advantages, and rising from his defeats =
with inexhaustible vigour. The discipline of the camp was revived, and a ne=
w generation of men and soldiers was created by the example and the precept=
s of their leader. In his intercourse with the Latins, Alexius was patient =
and artful; his discerning eye pervaded the new system of an unknown world;=
 and I shall hereafter describe the superior policy with which he balanced =
the interests and passions of the champions of the first crusade.<a href=3D=

ign of thirty-seven years, he subdued and pardoned the envy of his equals; =
the laws of public and private order were restored; the arts of wealth and =
science were cultivated; the limits of the empire were enlarged in Europe a=
nd Asia; and the Comnenian sceptre was transmitted to his children of the t=
hird and fourth generation. Yet the difficulties of the times betrayed some=
 defects in his character; and have exposed his memory to some just or unge=
nerous reproach. The reader may possibly smile at the lavish praise which h=
is daughter so often bestows on a flying hero; the weakness or prudence of =
his situation might be mistaken for a want of personal courage; and his pol=
itical arts are branded by the Latins with the names of deceit and dissimul=
ation. The increase of the male and female branches of his family adorned t=
he throne and secured the succession; but their princely luxury and pride o=
ffended the patricians, exhausted the revenue, and insulted the misery of t=
he people. Anna is a faithful witness that his happiness was destroyed, and=
 his health was broken, by the cares of a public life; the patience of Cons=
tantinople was fatigued by the length and severity of his reign; and, befor=
e Alexius expired, he had lost the love and reverence <span class=3D"pb"><s=
pan class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"brac=
ket">[</span>289<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> of his subjects. Th=
e clergy could not forgive his application of the sacred riches to the defe=
nce of the state; but they applauded his theological learning and ardent ze=
al for the orthodox faith, which he defended with his tongue, his pen, and =
his sword. His character was degraded by the superstition of the Greeks; an=
d the same inconsistent principle of human nature enjoined the emperor to f=
ound an hospital for the poor and infirm, and to direct the execution of an=
 heretic, who was burnt alive in the square of St. Sophia. Even the sinceri=
ty of his moral and religious virtues was suspected by the persons who had =
passed their lives in his familiar confidence. In his last hours, when he w=
as pressed by his wife Irene to alter the succession, he raised his head, a=
nd breathed a pious ejaculation on the vanity of this world. The indignant =
reply of the empress may be inscribed as an epitaph on his tomb, =E2=80=9CY=
ou die, as you have lived =E2=80=94 <span class=3D"sc">an hypocrite</span>!=
=E2=80=9D</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_418">It was the wish of Irene to supplant the eldes=
t of her surviving sons in favour of her daughter the princess Anna, whose =
philosophy would not have refused the weight of a diadem. But the order of =
male succession was asserted by the friends of their country; the lawful he=
ir drew the royal signet from the finger of his insensible or conscious fat=
her; and the empire obeyed the master of the palace. Anna Comnena was stimu=
lated by ambition and revenge to conspire against the life of her brother, =
and, when the design was prevented by the fears or scruples of her husband,=
 she passionately exclaimed that nature had mistaken the two sexes and had =
endowed Bryennius with the soul of a woman. The two sons of Alexius, John a=
nd Isaac, maintained the fraternal concord, the hereditary virtue of their =
race; and the younger brother was content with the title of <i>Sebastocrato=
r,</i> which approached the dignity, without sharing the power, of the empe=
ror. In the same person, the claims of primogeniture and merit were fortuna=
tely united; his swarthy complexion, harsh features, and <span class=3D"pb"=
><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"b=
racket">[</span>290<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> diminutive statu=
re had suggested the ironical surname of Calo-Johannes, or John the Handsom=
e, which his grateful subjects more seriously applied to the beauties of hi=
s mind. After the discovery of her treason, the life and fortune of Anna we=
re justly forfeited to the laws. Her life was spared by the clemency of the=
 emperor, but he visited the pomp and treasures of her palace, and bestowed=
 the rich confiscation on the most deserving of his friends. That respectab=
le friend, Axuch, a slave of Turkish extraction, presumed to decline the gi=
ft and to intercede for the criminal; his generous master applauded and imi=
tated the virtue of his favourite; and the reproach or complaint of an inju=
red brother was the only chastisement of the guilty princess. After this ex=
ample of clemency, the remainder of his reign was never disturbed by conspi=
racy or rebellion: feared by his nobles, beloved by his people, John was ne=
ver reduced to the painful necessity of punishing, or even of pardoning, hi=
s personal enemies. During his government of twenty-five years, the penalty=
 of death was abolished in the Roman empire, a law of mercy most delightful=
 to the humane theorist, but of which the practice, in a large and vicious =
community, is seldom consistent with the public safety. Severe to himself, =
indulgent to others, chaste, frugal, abstemious, the philosophic Marcus wou=
ld not have disdained the artless virtues of his successor, derived from hi=
s heart, and not borrowed from the schools. He despised and moderated the s=
tately magnificence of the Byzantine court, so oppressive to the people, so=
 contemptible to the eye of reason. Under such a prince, innocence had noth=
ing to fear, and merit had everything to hope; and, without assuming the ty=
rannic office of a censor, he introduced a gradual, though visible, reforma=
tion in the public and private manners of Constantinople. The only defect o=
f this accomplished character was the frailty of noble minds, the love of a=
rms and military glory. Yet the frequent expeditions of John the Handsome m=
ay be justified, at least in their principle, by the necessity of repelling=
 the Turks from the Hellespont <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration=
">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>291<span c=

as confined to his capital, the Barbarians were driven to the mountains, an=
d the maritime provinces of Asia enjoyed the transient blessings of their d=
eliverance. From Constantinople to Antioch and Aleppo, he repeatedly marche=
d at the head of a victorious army, and, in the sieges and battles of this =
holy war, his Latin allies were astonished by the superior spirit and prowe=
ss of a Greek. As he began to indulge the ambitious hope of restoring the a=
ncient limits of the empire, as he revolved in his mind the Euphrates and T=
igris, the dominion of Syria, and the conquest of Jerusalem, the thread of =
his life and of the public felicity was broken by a singular accident. He h=
unted the wild boar in the valley of Anazarbus, and had fixed his javelin i=
n the body of the furious animal; but, in the struggle, a poisoned arrow dr=
opped from his quiver, and a slight wound in his hand, which produced a mor=
tification, was fatal to the best and greatest of the Comnenian princes.</p=
>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_419">A premature death had swept away the two eldes=
t sons of John the Handsome; of the two survivors, Isaac and Manuel, his ju=
dgment or affection preferred the younger; and the choice of their dying pr=
ince was ratified by the soldiers who had applauded the valour of his favou=
rite in the Turkish war. The faithful Axuch hastened to the capital, secure=
d the person of Isaac in honourable confinement, and purchased, with a gift=
 of two hundred pounds of silver, the leading ecclesiastics of St. Sophia, =
who possessed a decisive voice in the consecration of an emperor. With his =
veteran and affectionate troops, Manuel soon visited Constantinople; his br=
other acquiesced in the title of Sebastocrator; his subjects admired the lo=
fty stature and martial graces of their new sovereign, and listened with cr=
edulity to the flattering promise that he blended the wisdom of age with th=
e activity and vigour of youth. By the experience of his government, they w=
ere taught that he emulated the spirit, and shared the talents, of his fath=
er, whose social virtues were buried in the grave. <span class=3D"pb"><span=
 class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket=
">[</span>292<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> A reign of thirty-seve=
n years is filled by a perpetual though various warfare against the Turks, =
the Christians, and the hordes in the wilderness beyond the Danube. The arm=
s of Manuel were exercised on Mount Taurus, in the plains of Hungary, on th=
e coast of Italy and Egypt, and on the seas of Sicily and Greece; the influ=
ence of his negotiations extended from Jerusalem to Rome and Russia; and th=
e Byzantine monarchy, for a while, became an object of respect or terror to=
 the powers of Asia and Europe. Educated in the silk and purple of the East=
, Manuel possessed the iron temper of a soldier, which cannot easily be par=
alleled, except in the lives of Richard the First of England, and of Charle=
s the Twelfth of Sweden. Such was his strength and exercise in arms that Ra=
ymond, surnamed the Hercules of Antioch, was incapable of wielding the lanc=
e and buckler of the Greek emperor. In a famous tournament, he entered the =
lists on a fiery courser, and overturned in his first career two of the sto=
utest of the Italian knights. The first in the charge, the last in the retr=
eat, his friends and his enemies alike trembled, the former for <i>his</i> =
safety and the latter for their own. After posting an ambuscade in a wood, =
he rode forwards in search of some perilous adventure, accompanied only by =
his brother and the faithful Axuch, who refused to desert their sovereign. =
Eighteen horsemen, after a short combat, fled before them; but the numbers =
of the enemy increased; the march of the reinforcement was tardy and fearfu=
l, and Manuel, without receiving a wound, cut his way through a squadron of=
 five hundred Turks. In a battle against the Hungarians, impatient of the s=
lowness of his troops, he snatched a standard from the head of the column, =
and was the first, almost alone, who passed a bridge that separated him fro=
m the enemy. In the same country, after transporting his army beyond the Sa=
ve, he sent back the boats with an order, under pain of death, to their com=
mander, that he should leave him to conquer or die on that hostile land. In=
 the siege of Corfu, towing after him a captive galley, the emperor stood a=
loft on the poop, opposing <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Ed=
ition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>293<span class=
=3D"bracket">]</span></span> against the volleys of darts and stones a larg=
e buckler and a flowing sail; nor could he have escaped inevitable death, h=
ad not the Sicilian admiral enjoined his archers to respect the person of a=
n hero. In one day, he is said to have slain above forty of the Barbarians =
with his own hand; he returned to the camp, dragging along four Turkish pri=
soners, whom he had tied to the rings of his saddle; he was ever the foremo=
st to provoke or to accept a single combat; and the <i>gigantic</i> champio=
ns, who encountered his arm, were transpierced by the lance, or cut asunder=
 by the sword, of the invincible Manuel. The story of his exploits, which a=
ppear as a model or a copy of the romances of chivalry, may induce a reason=
able suspicion of the veracity of the Greeks; I will not, to vindicate thei=
r credit, endanger my own; yet I may observe that, in the long series of th=
eir annals, Manuel is the only prince who has been the subject of similar e=
xaggeration. With the valour of a soldier, he did not unite the skill or pr=
udence of a general; his victories were not productive of any permanent or =
useful conquest; and his Turkish laurels were blasted in his last unfortuna=
te campaign, in which he lost his army in the mountains of Pisidia, and owe=
d his deliverance to the generosity of the sultan. But the most singular fe=
ature in the character of Manuel is the contrast and vicissitude of labour =
and sloth, of hardiness and effeminacy. In war he seemed ignorant of peace,=
 in peace he appeared incapable of war. In the field he slept in the sun or=
 in the snow, tired in the longest marches the strength of his men and hors=
es, and shared with a smile the abstinence or diet of the camp. No sooner d=
id he return to Constantinople than he resigned himself to the arts and ple=
asures of a life of luxury; the expense of his dress, his table, and his pa=
lace surpassed the measure of his predecessors, and whole summer days were =
idly wasted in the delicious isles of the Propontis, in the incestuous love=
 of his niece Theodora. The double cost of a warlike and dissolute prince e=
xhausted the revenue and multiplied the taxes; and Manuel, in the distress =
of his last Turkish camp, endured a bitter reproach <span class=3D"pb"><spa=
n class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracke=
t">[</span>294<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> from the mouth of a d=
esperate soldier. As he quenched his thirst, he complained that the water o=
f a fountain was mingled with Christian blood. =E2=80=9CIt is not the first=
 time,=E2=80=9D exclaimed a voice from the crowd, =E2=80=9Cthat you have dr=
ank, O emperor! the blood of your Christian subjects.=E2=80=9D Manuel Comne=
nus was twice married, to the virtuous Bertha or Irene of Germany, and to t=
he beauteous Maria, a French or Latin princess of Antioch. The only daughte=
r of his first wife was destined for Bela, an Hungarian prince, who was edu=
cated at Constantinople, under the name of Alexius; and the consummation of=
 their nuptials might have transferred the Roman sceptre to a race of free =
and warlike Barbarians. But, as soon as Maria of Antioch had given a son an=
d heir to the empire, the presumptive rights of Bela were abolished, and he=
 was deprived of his promised bride; but the Hungarian prince resumed his n=
ame and the kingdom of his fathers, and displayed such virtues as might exc=
ite the regret and envy of the Greeks. The son of Maria was named Alexius; =
and at the age of ten years he ascended the Byzantine throne, after his fat=
her=E2=80=99s decease had closed the glories of the Comnenian line.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_420">The fraternal concord of the two sons of the g=
reat Alexius had been sometimes clouded by an opposition of interest and pa=
ssion. By ambition, Isaac the Sebastocrator was excited to flight and rebel=
lion, from whence he was reclaimed by the firmness and clemency of John the=
 Handsome. The errors of Isaac, the father of the emperors of Trebizond, we=
re short and venial; but John, the elder of his sons, renounced for ever hi=
s religion. Provoked by a real or imaginary insult of his uncle, he escaped=
 from the Roman to the Turkish camp; his apostacy was rewarded with the sul=
tan=E2=80=99s daughter, the title of Chelebi, or noble, and the inheritance=
 of a princely estate; and in the fifteenth century Mahomet the Second boas=
ted of his Imperial descent from the Comnenian family. Andronicus, younger =
brother of John, son of Isaac, and grandson of Alexius Comnenus, is one of =
the most conspicuous characters of the age; and his genuine adventures migh=
t form the subject <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: c=
urrent; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>295<span class=3D"brac=
ket">]</span></span> of a very singular romance. To justify the choice of t=
hree ladies of royal birth, it is incumbent on me to observe that their for=
tunate lover was cast in the best proportions of strength and beauty; and t=
hat the want of the softer graces was supplied by a manly countenance, a lo=
fty stature, athletic muscles, and the air and deportment of a soldier. The=
 preservation, in his old age, of health and vigour was the reward of tempe=
rance and exercise. A piece of bread and a draught of water were often his =
sole and evening repast; and, if he tasted of a wild boar, or a stag, which=
 he had roasted with his own hands, it was the well-earned fruit of a labor=
ious chase. Dexterous in arms, he was ignorant of fear; his persuasive eloq=
uence could bend to every situation and character of life; his style, thoug=
h not his practice, was fashioned by the example of St. Paul; and, in every=
 deed of mischief, he had a heart to resolve, a head to contrive, and a han=
d to execute. In his youth, after the death of the emperor John, he followe=
d the retreat of the Roman army; but, in the march through Asia Minor, desi=
gn or accident tempted him to wander in the mountains; the hunter was encom=
passed by the Turkish huntsmen, and he remained some time a reluctant or wi=
lling captive in the power of the sultan. His virtues and vices recommended=
 him to the favour of his cousin; he shared the perils and the pleasures of=
 Manuel; and, while the emperor lived in public incest with his niece Theod=
ora, the affections of her sister Eudocia were seduced and enjoyed by Andro=
nicus. Above the decencies of her sex and rank, she gloried in the name of =
his concubine; and both the palace and the camp could witness that she slep=
t, or watched, in the arms of her lover. She accompanied him to his militar=
y command of Cilicia, the first scene of his valour and imprudence. He pres=
sed, with active ardour, the siege of Mopsuestia; the day was employed in t=
he boldest attacks; but the night was wasted in song and dance; and a band =
of Greek comedians formed the choicest part of his retinue. Andronicus was =
surprised by the sally of a vigilant foe; but, while his troops <span class=
=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span cla=
ss=3D"bracket">[</span>296<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> fled in d=
isorder, his invincible lance transpierced the thickest ranks of the Armeni=
ans. On his return to the Imperial camp in Macedonia, he was received by Ma=
nuel with public smiles and a private reproof; but the duchies of Naissus, =
Braniseba, and Castoria were the reward or consolation of the unsuccessful =
general. Eudocia still attended his motions; at midnight their tent was sud=
denly attacked by her angry brothers, impatient to expiate her infamy in hi=
s blood; his daring spirit refused her advice, and the disguise of a female=
 habit; and, boldly starting from his couch, he drew his sword and cut his =
way through the numerous assassins. It was here that he first betrayed his =
ingratitude and treachery: he engaged in a treasonable correspondence with =
the king of Hungary and the German emperor; approached the royal tent at a =
suspicious hour with a drawn sword, and under the mask of a Latin soldier a=
vowed an intention of revenge against a mortal foe; and imprudently praised=
 the fleetness of his horse as an instrument of flight and safety. The mona=
rch dissembled his suspicions; but, after the close of the campaign, Andron=
icus was arrested and strictly confined in a tower of the palace of Constan=
tinople.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_421">In this prison he was left above twelve years:=
 a most painful restraint, from which the thirst of action and pleasure per=
petually urged him to escape. Alone and pensive, he perceived some broken b=
ricks in a corner of the chamber, and gradually widened the passage till he=
 had explored a dark and forgotten recess. Into this hole he conveyed himse=
lf and the remains of his provisions, replacing the bricks in their former =
position, and erasing with care the footsteps of his retreat. At the hour o=
f the customary visit, his guards were amazed by the silence and solitude o=
f the prison, and reported, with shame and fear, his incomprehensible fligh=
t. The gates of the palace and city were instantly shut; the strictest orde=
rs were despatched into the provinces for the recovery of the fugitive; and=
 his wife, on the suspicion of a pious act, was basely imprisoned in the sa=
me tower. At the dead of night, <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoratio=
n">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>297<span =
class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> she beheld a spectre: she recognised her =
husband; they shared their provisions; and a son was the fruit of these sto=
len interviews, which alleviated the tediousness of their confinement. In t=
he custody of a woman, the vigilance of the keepers was insensibly relaxed;=
 and the captive had accomplished his real escape, when he was discovered, =
brought back to Constantinople, and loaded with a double chain. At length h=
e found the moment and the means of his deliverance. A boy, his domestic se=
rvant, intoxicated the guards, and obtained in wax the impression of the ke=
ys. By the diligence of his friends, a similar key, with a bundle of ropes,=
 was introduced into the prison, in the bottom of a hogshead. Andronicus em=
ployed, with industry and courage, the instruments of his safety, unlocked =
the doors, descended from the tower, concealed himself all day among the bu=
shes, and scaled in the night the garden-wall of the palace. A boat was sta=
tioned for his reception; he visited his own house, embraced his children, =
cast away his chain, mounted a fleet horse, and directed his rapid course t=
owards the banks of the Danube. At Anchialus in Thrace, an intrepid friend =
supplied him with horses and money; he passed the river, traversed with spe=
ed the desert of Moldavia and the Carpathian hills, and had almost reached =
the town of Halicz, in the Polish Russia, when he was intercepted by a part=
y of Walachians, who resolved to convey their important captive to Constant=
inople. His presence of mind again extricated him from this danger. Under t=
he pretence of sickness, he dismounted in the night, and was allowed to ste=
p aside from the troop; he planted in the ground his long staff; clothed it=
 with his cap and upper garment; and, stealing into the wood, left a phanto=
m to amuse for some time the eyes of the Walachians. From Halicz he was hon=
ourably conducted to Kiow, the residence of the great duke; the subtle Gree=
k soon obtained the esteem and confidence of Ieroslaus; his character could=
 assume the manners of every climate; and the Babarians applauded his stren=
gth and courage in the chase of the elks and bears of the forest. <span cla=

lass=3D"bracket">[</span>298<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> In this=
 northern region he deserved the forgiveness of Manuel, who solicited the R=
ussian prince to join his arms in the invasion of Hungary. The influence of=
 Andronicus achieved this important service; his private treaty was signed =
with a promise of fidelity on one side and of oblivion on the other; and he=
 marched, at the head of the Russian cavalry, from the Borysthenes to the D=
anube. In his resentment Manuel had ever sympathised with the martial and d=
issolute character of his cousin; and his free pardon was sealed in the ass=
ault of Zemlin, in which he was second, and second only, to the valour of t=
he emperor.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_422">No sooner was the exile restored to freedom an=
d his country, than his ambition revived, at first to his own, and at lengt=
h to the public, misfortune. A daughter of Manuel was a feeble bar to the s=
uccession of the more deserving males of the Comnenian blood; her future ma=
rriage with the prince of Hungary was repugnant to the hopes or prejudices =
of the princes and nobles. But, when an oath of allegiance was required to =
the presumptive heir, Andronicus alone asserted the honour of the Roman nam=
e, declined the unlawful engagement, and boldly protested against the adopt=
ion of a stranger. His patriotism was offensive to the emperor, but he spok=
e the sentiments of the people, and was removed from the royal presence by =
an honourable banishment, a second command of the Cilician frontier, with t=
he absolute disposal of the revenues of Cyprus. In this station, the Armeni=
ans again exercised his courage and exposed his negligence; and the same re=
bel, who baffled all his operations, was unhorsed and almost slain by the v=
igour of his lance. But Andronicus soon discovered a more easy and pleasing=
 conquest, the beautiful Philippa, sister of the empress Maria, and daughte=
r of Raymond of Poitou, the Latin prince of Antioch. For her sake he desert=
ed his station, and wasted the summer in balls and tournaments; to his love=
 she sacrificed her innocence, her reputation, and the offer of an advantag=
eous marriage. But the resentment of Manuel for this domestic <span class=
=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span cla=
ss=3D"bracket">[</span>299<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> affront i=
nterrupted his pleasures; Andronicus left the indiscreet princess to weep a=
nd to repent; and, with a band of desperate adventurers, undertook the pilg=
rimage of Jerusalem. His birth, his martial renown, and professions of zeal=
 announced him as the champion of the Cross; he soon captivated both the cl=
ergy and the king; and the Greek prince was invested with the lordship of B=
erytus, on the coast of Ph=C5=93nicia. In his neighbourhood resided a young=
 and handsome queen, of his own nation and family, great-granddaughter of t=
he emperor Alexius, and widow of Baldwin the Third, king of Jerusalem. She =
visited and loved her kinsman. Theodora was the third victim of his amorous=
 seduction; and her shame was more public and scandalous than that of her p=
redecessors. The emperor still thirsted for revenge; and his subjects and a=
llies of the Syrian frontier were repeatedly pressed to seize the person, a=
nd put out the eyes, of the fugitive. In Palestine he was no longer safe; b=
ut the tender Theodora revealed his danger and accompanied his flight. The =
queen of Jerusalem was exposed to the East, his obsequious concubine; and t=
wo illegitimate children were the living monuments of her weakness. Damascu=
s was his first refuge; and in the character of the great Noureddin and his=
 servant Saladin, the superstitious Greek might learn to revere the virtues=
 of the Musulmans. As the friend of Noureddin he visited, most probably, Ba=
gdad and the courts of Persia; and, after a long circuit round the Caspian =
sea and the mountains of Georgia, he finally settled among the Turks of Asi=
a Minor, the hereditary enemies of his country.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_423">The sultan of Colonia afforded an hospitable r=
etreat to Andronicus, his mistress, and his band of outlaws; the debt of gr=
atitude was paid by frequent inroads in the Roman province of Trebizond; an=
d he seldom returned without an ample harvest of spoil and of Christian cap=
tives. In the story of his adventures, he was fond of comparing himself to =
David, who escaped, by a long exile, the snares of the wicked. But the roya=
l prophet (he presumed to add) was <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decora=
tion">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>300<sp=
an class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> content to lurk on the borders of Jud=
=C3=A6a, to slay an Amalekite, and to threaten, in his miserable state, the=
 life of the avaricious Nabal. The excursions of the Comnenian prince had a=
 wider range; and he had spread over the Eastern world the glory of his nam=
e and religion. By a sentence of the Greek church, the licentious rover had=
 been separated from the faithful; but even this excommunication may prove =
that he never abjured the profession of Christianity.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_424">His vigilance had eluded or repelled the open =
and secret persecution of the emperor; but he was at length ensnared by the=
 captivity of his female companion. The governor of Trebizond succeeded in =
his attempt to surprise the person of Theodora; the queen of Jerusalem and =
her two children were sent to Constantinople, and their loss embittered the=
 tedious solitude of banishment. The fugitive implored and obtained a final=
 pardon, with leave to throw himself at the feet of his sovereign, who was =
satisfied with the submission of this haughty spirit. Prostrate on the grou=
nd, he deplored with tears and groans the guilt of his past rebellion; nor =
would he presume to arise, unless some faithful subject would drag him to t=
he foot of the throne by an iron chain with which he had secretly encircled=
 his neck. This extraordinary penance excited the wonder and pity of the as=
sembly; his sins were forgiven by the church and state; but the just suspic=
ion of Manuel fixed his residence at a distance from the court, at =C5=92no=
e, a town of Pontus, surrounded with rich vineyards, and situate on the coa=
st of the Euxine. The death of Manuel and the disorders of the minority soo=
n opened the fairest field to his ambition. The emperor was a boy of twelve=
 or fourteen years of age, without vigour, or wisdom, or experience; his mo=
ther, the empress Mary, abandoned her person and government to a favourite =
of the Comnenian name; and his sister, another Mary, whose husband, an Ital=
ian, was decorated with the title of C=C3=A6sar, excited a conspiracy, and =
at length an insurrection, against her odious stepmother. The provinces wer=
e forgotten, the capital was in flames, and a <span class=3D"pb"><span clas=
s=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</=
span>301<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> century of peace and order =
was overthrown in the vice and weakness of a few months. A civil war was ki=
ndled in Constantinople; the two factions fought a bloody battle in the squ=
are of the palace; and the rebels sustained a regular siege in the cathedra=
l of St. Sophia. The patriarch laboured with honest zeal to heal the wounds=
 of the republic, the most respectable patriots called aloud for a guardian=
 and avenger, and every tongue repeated the praise of the talents and even =
the virtues of Andronicus. In his retirement he affected to revolve the sol=
emn duties of his oath: =E2=80=9CIf the safety or honour of the Imperial fa=
mily be threatened, I will reveal and oppose the mischief to the utmost of =
my power.=E2=80=9D His correspondence with the patriarch and patricians was=
 seasoned with apt quotations from the Psalms of David and the Epistles of =
St. Paul; and he patiently waited till he was called to her deliverance by =
the voice of his country. In his march from =C5=92noe to Constantinople, hi=
s slender train insensibly swelled to a crowd and an army; his professions =
of religion and loyalty were mistaken for the language of his heart; and th=
e simplicity of a foreign dress, which shewed to advantage his majestic sta=
ture, displayed a lively image of his poverty and exile. All opposition sun=
k before him; he reached the straits of the Thracian Bosphorus; the Byzanti=
ne navy sailed from the harbour to receive and transport the saviour of the=
 empire; the torrent was loud and irresistible, and the insects who had bas=
ked in the sunshine of royal favour disappeared at the blast of the storm. =
It was the first care of Andronicus to occupy the palace, to salute the emp=
eror, to confine his mother, to punish her minister, and to restore the pub=
lic order and tranquillity. He then visited the sepulchre of Manuel: the sp=
ectators were ordered to stand aloof; but, as he bowed in the attitude of p=
rayer, they heard, or thought they heard, a murmur of triumph and revenge: =
=E2=80=9CI no longer fear thee, my old enemy, who hast driven me a vagabond=
 to every climate of the earth. Thou art safely deposited under a sevenfold=
 dome, from whence <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: c=
urrent; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>302<span class=3D"brac=
ket">]</span></span> thou canst never arise till the signal of the last tru=
mpet. It is now my turn, and speedily will I trample on thy ashes and thy p=
osterity.=E2=80=9D From his subsequent tyranny, we may impute such feelings=
 to the man and the moment; but it is not extremely probable that he gave a=
n articulate sound to his secret thoughts. In the first months of his admin=
istration, his designs were veiled by a fair semblance of hypocrisy, which =
could delude only the eyes of the multitude; the coronation of Alexius was =
performed with due solemnity, and his perfidious guardian, holding in his h=
ands the body and blood of Christ, most fervently declared that he lived, a=
nd was ready to die, for the service of his beloved pupil. But his numerous=
 adherents were instructed to maintain that the sinking empire must perish =
in the hands of a child, that the Romans could only be saved by a veteran p=
rince, bold in arms, skilful in policy, and taught to reign by the long exp=
erience of fortune and mankind; and that it was the duty of every citizen t=
o force the reluctant modesty of Andronicus to undertake the burthen of the=
 public care. The young emperor was himself constrained to join his voice t=
o the general acclamation and to solicit the association of a colleague, wh=
o instantly degraded him from the supreme rank, secluded his person, and ve=
rified the rash declaration of the patriarch that Alexius might be consider=
ed as dead, so soon as he was committed to the custody of his guardian. But=
 his death was preceded by the imprisonment and execution of his mother. Af=
ter blackening her reputation and inflaming against her the passions of the=
 multitude, the tyrant accused and tried the empress for a treasonable corr=
espondence with the king of Hungary. His own son, a youth of honour and hum=
anity, avowed his abhorrence of this flagitious act, and three of the judge=
s had the merit of preferring their conscience to their safety; but the obs=
equious tribunal, without requiring any proof or hearing any defence, conde=
mned the widow of Manuel; and her unfortunate son subscribed the sentence o=
f her death. Maria was strangled, her corpse was buried in <span class=3D"p=
b"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D=
"bracket">[</span>303<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> the sea, and h=
er memory was wounded by the insult most offensive to female vanity, a fals=
e and ugly representation of her beauteous form. The fate of her son was no=
t long deferred; he was strangled with a bowstring, and the tyrant, insensi=
ble to pity or remorse, after surveying the body of the innocent youth, str=
uck it rudely with his foot: =E2=80=9CThy father,=E2=80=9D he cried, =E2=80=
=9Cwas a <i>knave,</i> thy mother a <i>whore,</i> and thyself a <i>fool!</i=
>=E2=80=9D</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_425">The Roman sceptre, the reward of his crimes, w=
as held by Andronicus about three years and a half, as the guardian or sove=
reign of the empire. His government exhibited a singular contrast of vice a=
nd virtue. When he listened to his passions, he was the scourge, when he co=
nsulted his reason, the father, of his people.<a href=3D"https://oll.libert=

lass=3D"footnote-link type-footnote">72</a> In the exercise of private just=
ice, he was equitable and rigorous; a shameful and pernicious venality was =
abolished, and the offices were filled with the most deserving candidates, =
by a prince who had sense to choose and severity to punish. He prohibited t=
he inhuman practice of pillaging the goods and persons of shipwrecked marin=
ers; the provinces, so long the objects of oppression or neglect, revived i=
n prosperity and plenty; and millions applauded the distant blessings of hi=
s reign, while he was cursed by the witnesses of his daily cruelties. The a=
ncient proverb, that bloodthirsty is the man who returns from banishment to=
 power, had been applied with too much truth to Marius and Tiberius; and wa=
s now verified for the third time in the life of Andronicus. His memory was=
 stored with a black list of the enemies and rivals, who had traduced his m=
erit, opposed his greatness, or insulted his misfortunes; <span class=3D"pb=
"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"=
bracket">[</span>304<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> and the only co=
mfort of his exile was the sacred hope and promise of revenge. The necessar=
y extinction of the young emperor and his mother imposed the fatal obligati=
on of extirpating the friends who hated and might punish the assassin; and =
the repetition of murder rendered him less willing, and less able, to forgi=
ve. An horrid narrative of the victims whom he sacrificed by poison or the =
sword, by the sea or the flames, would be less expressive of his cruelty th=
an the appellation of the Halcyon-days, which was applied to a rare and blo=
odless week of repose. The tyrant strove to transfer, on the laws and the j=
udges, some portion of his guilt; but the mask was fallen, and his subjects=
 could no longer mistake the true author of their calamities. The noblest o=
f the Greeks, more especially those who, by descent or alliance, might disp=
ute the Comnenian inheritance, escaped from the monster=E2=80=99s den; Nice=
 or Prusa, Sicily or Cyprus, were their places of refuge; and, as their fli=
ght was already criminal, they aggravated their offence by an open revolt a=
nd the Imperial title. Yet Andronicus resisted the daggers and swords of hi=
s most formidable enemies; Nice and Prusa were reduced and chastised; the S=
icilians were content with the sack of Thessalonica; and the distance of Cy=
prus was not more propitious to the rebel than to the tyrant. His throne wa=
s subverted by a rival without merit and a people without arms. Isaac Angel=
us, a descendant in the female line from the great Alexius, was marked as a=
 victim by the prudence or superstition of the emperor. In a moment of desp=
air, Angelus defended his life and liberty, slew the executioner, and fled =
to the church of St. Sophia. The sanctuary was insensibly filled with a cur=
ious and mournful crowd, who, in his fate, prognosticated their own. But th=
eir lamentations were soon turned to curses, and their curses to threats; t=
hey dared to ask, =E2=80=9CWhy do we fear? why do we obey? We are many, and=
 he is one; our patience is the only bond of our slavery.=E2=80=9D With the=
 dawn of day the city burst into a general sedition, the prisons were throw=
n open, the coldest and most servile were <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D=
"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span=
>305<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> roused to the defence of their =
country, and Isaac, the second of the name, was raised from the sanctuary t=
o the throne. Unconscious of his danger, the tyrant was absent, withdrawn f=
rom the toils of state, in the delicious islands of the Propontis. He had c=
ontracted an indecent marriage with Alice, or Agnes, daughter of Lewis the =
Seventh of France, and relict of the unfortunate Alexius; and his society, =
more suitable to his temper than to his age, was composed of a young wife a=
nd a favourite concubine. On the first alarm he rushed to Constantinople, i=
mpatient for the blood of the guilty; but he was astonished by the silence =
of the palace, the tumult of the city, and the general desertion of mankind=
. Andronicus proclaimed a free pardon to his subjects; they neither desired=
 nor would grant forgiveness: he offered to resign the crown to his son Man=
uel; but the virtues of the son could not expiate his father=E2=80=99s crim=
es. The sea was still open for his retreat; but the news of the revolution =
had flown along the coast; when fear had ceased, obedience was no more; the=
 Imperial galley was pursued and taken by an armed brigantine; and the tyra=
nt was dragged to the presence of Isaac Angelus, loaded with fetters, and a=
 long chain round his neck. His eloquence and the tears of his female compa=
nions pleaded in vain for his life; but, instead of the decencies of a lega=
l execution, the new monarch abandoned the criminal to the numerous suffere=
rs whom he had deprived of a father, an husband, or a friend. His teeth and=
 hair, an eye and a hand, were torn from him, as a poor compensation for th=
eir loss; and a short respite was allowed, that he might feel the bitternes=
s of death. Astride on a camel, without any danger of a rescue, he was carr=
ied through the city, and the basest of the populace rejoiced to trample on=
 the fallen majesty of their prince. After a thousand blows and outrages, A=
ndronicus was hung by the feet between two pillars that supported the statu=
es of a wolf and sow; and every hand that could reach the public enemy infl=
icted on his body some mark of ingenious or <span class=3D"pb"><span class=
=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</s=
pan>306<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> brutal cruelty, till two fri=
endly or furious Italians, plunging their swords into his body, released hi=
m from all human punishment. In this long and painful agony, =E2=80=9CLord =
have mercy upon me!=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9CWhy will you bruise a broken reed=
?=E2=80=9D were the only words that escaped from his mouth. Our hatred for =
the tyrant is lost in pity for the man; nor can we blame his pusillanimous =
resignation, since a Greek Christian was no longer master of his life.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_426">I have been tempted to expatiate on the extrao=
rdinary character and adventures of Andronicus; but I shall here terminate =
the series of the Greek emperors since the time of Heraclius. The branches =
that sprang from the Comnenian trunk had insensibly withered; and the male =
line was continued only in the posterity of Andronicus himself, who, in the=
 public confusion, usurped the sovereignty of Trebizond, so obscure in hist=
ory and so famous in romance. A private citizen of Philadelphia, Constantin=
e Angelus, had emerged to wealth and honours by his marriage with a daughte=
r of the emperor Alexius. His son Andronicus is conspicuous only by his cow=
ardice. His grandson Isaac punished and succeeded the tyrant; but he was de=
throned by his own vices and the ambition of his brother; and their discord=
 introduced the Latins to the conquest of Constantinople, the first great p=
eriod in the fall of the Eastern empire.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_427">If we compute the number and duration of the r=
eigns, it will be found that a period of six hundred years is filled by six=
ty emperors; including, in the Augustan list, some female sovereigns, and d=
educting some usurpers who were never acknowledged in the capital, and some=
 princes who did not live to possess their inheritance. The average proport=
ion will allow ten years for each emperor, far below the chronological rule=
 of Sir Isaac Newton, who, from the experience of more recent and regular m=
onarchies, has defined about eighteen or twenty years as the term of an ord=
inary reign. The Byzantine empire was most tranquil and prosperous, when it=
 could acquiesce in hereditary succession; five dynasties, <span class=3D"p=
b"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D=
"bracket">[</span>307<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> the Heraclian,=
 Isaurian, Amorian, Basilian, and Comnenian families, enjoyed and transmitt=
ed the royal patrimony during their respective series of five, four, three,=
 six, and four generations; several princes number the years of their reign=
 with those of their infancy; and Constantine the Seventh and his two grand=
sons occupy the space of an entire century. But in the intervals of the Byz=
antine dynasties, the succession is rapid and broken, and the name of a suc=
cessful candidate is speedily erased by a more fortunate competitor. Many w=
ere the paths that led to the summit of royalty; the fabric of rebellion wa=
s overthrown by the stroke of conspiracy or undermined by the silent arts o=
f intrigue; the favourites of the soldiers or people, of the senate or cler=
gy, of the women and eunuchs, were alternately clothed with the purple; the=
 means of their elevation were base, and their end was often contemptible o=
r tragic. A being of the nature of man, endowed with the same faculties, bu=
t with a longer measure of existence, would cast down a smile of pity and c=
ontempt on the crimes and follies of human ambition, so eager, in a narrow =
span, to grasp at a precarious and short-lived enjoyment. It is thus that t=
he experience of history exalts and enlarges the horizon of our intellectua=
l view. In a composition of some days, in a perusal of some hours, six hund=
red years have rolled away, and the duration of a life or reign is contract=
ed to a fleeting moment; the grave is ever beside the throne; the success o=
f a criminal is almost instantly followed by the loss of his prize; and our=
 immortal reason survives and disdains the sixty phantoms of kings, who hav=
e passed before our eyes and faintly dwell on our remembrance. The observat=
ion that, in every age and climate, ambition has prevailed with the same co=
mmanding energy may abate the surprise of a philosopher; but, while he cond=
emns the vanity, he may search the motive, of this universal desire to obta=
in and hold the sceptre of dominion. To the greater part of the Byzantine s=
eries we cannot reasonably ascribe the love of fame and of mankind. The vir=
tue alone <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; P=
age: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>308<span class=3D"bracket">]</s=
pan></span> of John Comnenus was beneficent and pure; the most illustrious =
of the princes who precede or follow that respectable name have trod with s=
ome dexterity and vigour the crooked and bloody paths of a selfish policy; =
in scrutinising the imperfect characters of Leo the Isaurian, Basil the Fir=
st, and Alexius Comnenus, of Theophilus, the second Basil, and Manuel Comne=
nus, our esteem and censure are almost equally balanced; and the remainder =
of the Imperial crowd could only desire and expect to be forgotten by poste=
rity. Was personal happiness the aim and object of their ambition? I shall =
not descant on the vulgar topics of the misery of kings; but I may surely o=
bserve that their condition, of all others, is the most pregnant with fear =
and the least susceptible of hope. For these opposite passions, a larger sc=
ope was allowed in the revolutions of antiquity than in the smooth and soli=
d temper of the modern world, which cannot easily repeat either the triumph=
 of Alexander or the fall of Darius. But the peculiar infelicity of the Byz=
antine princes exposed them to domestic perils, without affording any livel=
y promise of foreign conquest. From the pinnacle of greatness, Andronicus w=
as precipitated by a death more cruel and shameful than that of the vilest =
malefactor; but the most glorious of his predecessors had much more to drea=
d from their subjects than to hope from their enemies. The army was licenti=
ous without spirit, the nation turbulent without freedom; the Barbarians of=
 the East and West pressed on the monarchy, and the loss of the provinces w=
as terminated by the final servitude of the capital.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_428">The entire series of Roman emperors, from the =
first of the C=C3=A6sars to the last of the Constantines, extends above fif=
teen hundred years; and the term of dominion unbroken by foreign conquest s=
urpasses the measure of the ancient monarchies: the Assyrians or Medes, the=
 successors of Cyrus, or those of Alexander.</p>

 built the structure of the Catholic faith. After a serious deliberation of=
 six months, the three hundred and thirty-eight bishops pronounced and subs=

 the patriarch of Constantinople and the pope of Rome were nearly equal. Bu=

popular election endeared them to the Romans; the public and private indige=

 emperors compelled them to consult, both in peace and war, the temporal sa=

re the genuine forms of Christ, his mother, and his saints, who had approve=

. He must indeed have trusted to the ignorance of Leo, since he could asser=
t the perpetual use of images from the apostolic age, and their venerable p=
resence in the six synods of the Catholic church. A more specious argument =
is drawn from present possession and recent practice; the harmony of the Ch=
ristian world supersedes the demand of a general council; and Gregory frank=
ly confesses that such assemblies can only be useful under the reign of an =
orthodox prince. To the impudent and inhuman Leo, more guilty than an heret=
ic, he recommends peace, silence, and implicit obedience to his spiritual g=

 the latter, the soul: the sword of justice is in the hands of the magistra=

 domestic deities; the images of Christ and the virgin, of the angels, mart=

alternative was proposed to the Roman pontiff, the royal favour as the pric=

temper of a statesman, to the various practice of France and Italy. In his =
four pilgrimages or visits to the Vatican, he embraced the popes in the com=

ore the image, of the apostle; and joined, without scruple, in all the pray=

The title of patrician was below the merit and greatness of Charlemagne; an=

finally eradicate the claims of the Greeks; from the debasement of a provin=

activity was a national rather than a personal virtue; the vagrant life of =
a Frank was spent in the chase, in pilgrimage, in military adventures; and =
the journeys of Charlemagne were distinguished only by a more numerous trai=

ipline, or in arms. The science of war has been lost and revived with the a=

of singular difficulty and success; and he might behold, with envy, the Sar=

egular administration to protect and punish; and a well-disciplined army to=

the situation of the German C=C3=A6sars, who were ambitious to enslave the =
kingdom of Italy. Their patrimonial estates were stretched along the Rhine,=
 or scattered in the provinces; but this ample domain was alienated by the =
imprudence or distress of successive princes; and their revenue, from minut=

 their household. Their troops were formed by the legal or voluntary servic=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_460">The Barbarian conquerors of the West were plea=
sed to decorate their chief with the title of emperor; but it was not their=
 design to invest him with the despotism of Constantine and Justinian. The =
persons of the Germans were free, their conquests were their own, and their=
 national character was animated by a spirit which scorned the servile juri=
sprudence of the new or the ancient Rome. It would have been a vain and dan=
gerous attempt to impose a monarch on the armed freemen, who were impatient=
 of a magistrate; on the bold, who refused to obey; on the powerful, who as=
pired to command. The empire of Charlemagne and Otho was distributed among =
the dukes of the nations or provinces, the counts of the smaller districts,=
 and the margraves of the marches or frontiers, who all united the civil an=
d military authority as it had been delegated to the lieutenants of the fir=
st C=C3=A6sars. The Roman governors, who, for the most part, <span class=3D=
"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=
=3D"bracket">[</span>387<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> were soldie=
rs of fortune, seduced their mercenary legions, assumed the Imperial purple=
, and either failed or succeeded in their revolt, without wounding the powe=
r and unity of government. If the dukes, margraves, and counts of Germany w=
ere less audacious in their claims, the consequences of their success were =
more lasting and pernicious to the state. Instead of aiming at the supreme =
rank, they silently laboured to establish and appropriate their provincial =
independence. Their ambition was seconded by the weight of their estates an=
d vassals, their mutual example and support, the common interest of the sub=
ordinate nobility, the change of princes and families, the minorities of Ot=
ho the Third and Henry the Fourth, the ambition of the popes, and the vain =
pursuits of the fugitive crowns of Italy and Rome. All the attributes of re=
gal and territorial jurisdiction were gradually usurped by the commanders o=
f the provinces; the right of peace and war, of life and death, of coinage =
and taxation, of foreign alliance and domestic economy. Whatever had been s=
eized by violence was ratified by favour or distress, was granted as the pr=
ice of a doubtful vote or a voluntary service; whatever had been granted to=
 one could not, without injury, be denied to his successor or equal; and ev=
ery act of local or temporary possession was insensibly moulded into the co=
nstitution of the Germanic kingdom. In every province, the visible presence=
 of the duke or count was interposed between the throne and the nobles; the=
 subjects of the law became the vassals of a private chief; and the standar=
d, which <i>he</i> received from his sovereign, was often raised against hi=
m in the field. The temporal power of the clergy was cherished and exalted =
by the superstition or policy of the Carlovingian and Saxon dynasties, who =
blindly depended on their moderation and fidelity; and the bishoprics of Ge=
rmany were made equal in extent and privilege, superior in wealth and popul=
ation, to the most ample states of the military order. As long as the emper=
ors retained the prerogative of bestowing on every vacancy these ecclesiast=
ic and secular <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: curre=
nt; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>388<span class=3D"bracket"=

ambition of their friends and favourites. But in the quarrel of the investi=
tures they were deprived of their influence over the episcopal chapters; th=
e freedom of election was restored, and the sovereign was reduced, by a sol=
emn mockery, to his <i>first prayers,</i> the recommendation, once in his r=
eign, to a single prebend in each church. The secular governors, instead of=
 being recalled at the will of a superior, could be degraded only by the se=
ntence of their peers. In the first age of the monarchy, the appointment of=
 the son to the duchy or county of his father was solicited as a favour; it=
 was gradually obtained as a custom and extorted as a right; the lineal suc=
cession was often extended to the collateral or female branches; the states=
 of the empire (their popular, and at length their legal, appellation) were=
 divided and alienated by testament and sale; and all idea of a public trus=
t was lost in that of a private and perpetual inheritance. The emperor coul=
d not even be enriched by the casualties of forfeiture and extinction; with=
in the term of a year he was obliged to dispose of the vacant fief; and in =
the choice of the candidate it was his duty to consult either the general o=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_461">After the death of Frederic the Second, German=
y was left a monster with an hundred heads. A crowd of princes and prelates=
 disputed the ruins of the empire; the lords of innumerable castles were le=
ss prone to obey than to imitate their superiors; and, according to the mea=
sure of their strength, their incessant hostilities received the names of c=
onquest or robbery. Such anarchy was the inevitable consequence of the laws=
 and manners of Europe; and the kingdoms of France and Italy were shivered =
into fragments by the violence of the same tempest. But the Italian cities =
and French vassals were divided and destroyed, while the union of the Germa=

 contemporary of Heraclius and Constans (c. 30 <i>ad fin.,</i> p. 122; and =
c. 34 <i>ad init.,</i> p. 148, tr. Patk.); and this agrees with some brief =

645 (of which he gives a full account in c. 33). It is also stated that he =
was Bishop of Bagratun. The work is not strictly confined to the reign of H=
eraclius. It begins in the reign of the Persian king Perozes in the fifth c=
entury, and briefly touches the reigns of Kobad and of Chosroes I., of whom=
 Sebaeos relates the legend that he was converted to Christianity. The even=
ts connected with the revolt of Bahram and the accession of Chosroes II. ar=
e told at more length (c. 2-3), and especial prominence is given to the par=
t played by the Armenian prince Musheg, who supported Chosroes. The next se=

 intrigues in Armenia during the reign of Maurice. It is not till the twent=

ed the legal profession; was a judge in Philadelphia under Michael IV.; an =
Imperial secretary under Michael V. He enjoyed the favour of Constantine IX=
., who founded a university at Constantinople and appointed Psellus Profess=
or of Philosophy. But his services were required in political life; he beca=
me chief secretary (proto-asecretis) of the Emperor and one of his most inf=
luential ministers. Presently he left the world to become a monk and assume=
d the name of Michael, by which he is generally known. But monastic life ha=
rdly suited him, and after some years he returned to the world. He played a=
 prominent part under Isaac Comnenus and Constantine Ducas; and was =E2=80=
=9Cprime minister=E2=80=9D during the regency of Eudocia and the reign of M=
ichael Parapinaces (a pupil who did him small credit). He died probably in =
1078. As professor, Psellus had revived an interest in Plato, whose philoso=
phy he set above Aristotle =E2=80=94 a novelty which was regarded as a here=
sy. In this, he was stoutly opposed by his friend John Xiphilin, who was a =
pronounced Aristotelian. As young men, Psellus had taught Xiphilin philosop=
hy, and Xiphilin had taught Psellus law. It was through the influence or ex=
ample of Xiphilin (who withdrew to the monastery of Bithynian Olympus) that=
 Psellus had assumed the tonsure. Xiphilin, who had written on law in his y=
outh, wrote homilies in his later years, and became Patriarch of Constantin=
ople in 1064; his old friend Psellus pronounced his funeral oration in 1075=

adapted himself to the rules of the game, and was servile and unscrupulous.=
 His Chronography reflects the tone of the time-serving courtier. Beginning=
 at <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 976, it t=
reats very briefly the long reign of Basil, and becomes fuller as it goes o=
n. It deals chiefly with domestic wars and court intrigues; passing over br=
iefly, and often omitting altogether, the wars with foreign peoples. The la=
st part of the work was written for the eye of Michael Parapinaces, and con=
sequently in what concerns him and his father Constantine X. is very far fr=
om being impartial.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_507">The funeral orations which Psellus composed on=
 Xiphilin, on the Patriarch Michael Cerularius (see above, p. 281), and on =
Lichudes, a prominent statesman of the time, have much historical importanc=

 the whole field of knowledge. It has been well said that Psellus is the Ph=

 great influence on the writers of the generation which succeeded him. [For=

gory range over fourteen indictions, and the =E2=80=9CHadrianic Register,=
=E2=80=9D as it is called, falls into fourteen Books, according to the indi=
ctions. This is our basis of chronology. There is (2) a second collection o=
f 200 letters without dates (except in one case), of which more than a quar=
ter are common to the Hadrianic Register. It has been proved that all these=
 letters belong to a single year (<span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity =
ad">ad</span></span> 598-9); but in the text of the Benedictines they are s=
cattered over all the years. (3) The third collection (Collectio Pauli) is =
smaller; it contained 53 letters, of which 21 are peculiar to itself. Here =
too, though the Benedictine edition distributes these letters over six year=
s, it has been proved that they all belong to three particular years. These=
 results were reached by very long and laborious research by Paul Ewald, wh=
ose article in the Neues Archiv of 1878 (iii. 433 <i>sqq.</i>) has revoluti=
onised the study of Gregory=E2=80=99s correspondence and established the or=
der of the letters. A new critical edition, based on Ewald=E2=80=99s resear=
ches, has appeared in the Monumenta Germ. Historica, in two vols. Only Bks.=
 1-4 are the work of Ewald; but on his premature death the work was continu=

him there an intimate friend and adviser of Arichis, Duke of Beneventum, an=

t was her interest in history that stimulated him to edit the history of Eu=
tropius and add to it a continuation of his own in six Books (the compilati=

the Great, in order to win the grace of the conqueror. He was certainly suc=
cessful in his enterprise, and his literary accomplishments were valued by =
Charles, at whose court he remained several years. When he returned to Ital=
y he resumed his abode at Monte Cassino. His last years were devoted to the=
 Historia Langobardorum. Beginning with the remote period at which his nati=

year in which the Lombards ceased to be an independent nation; but the work=

It is deeply to be regretted that the work has not survived, not only on ac=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_529">The two sources which formed the chief basis o=
f all that is authentic in later Arabic Lives of the Prophet (such as that =
of Ab=C5=AB-l-Fid=C4=81) are fortunately extant; and, this having been esta=

tions. (<i>a</i>) The life by <span class=3D"csc">Mohammad ibn Ish=C4=81k</=

 independent form; but it survives in Ibn Hish=C4=81m=E2=80=99s (ob. 823) H=
istory of the Prophet, which seems to have been practically a very freely r=
evised edition of Ibn Ish=C4=81k, but can be controlled to some extent by t=
he copious quotations from Ibn Ish=C4=81k in the work of Tabar=C4=AB. Ibn I=

pan class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 754-775); and i=
t must always be remembered that the tendency of historical works composed =
under Abb=C4=81sid influence was to pervert tradition in the Abb=C4=81sid i=
nterest by exalting the members of the Prophet=E2=80=99s family, and misrep=
resenting the forefathers of the Omayyads. This feature appears in the work=
 of Ibn Ish=C4=81k, although in the world of Islam he has the reputation of=
 being an eminently and exceptionally trustworthy writer. But it is not dif=
ficult to make allowance for this colouring; and otherwise there is no reas=
on to doubt that he reproduced truthfully the fairly trustworthy tradition =
which had been crystallised under the Omayyads, and which, in its general f=
ramework, and so far as the outer life of the Prophet himself was concerned=
, was preserved both by the supporters of the descendants of Al=C4=AB and b=

dea of criticising or sifting his sources; he merely puts side by side the =
statements of earlier writers without reconciling their discrepancies or at=
tempting to educe the truth. Though this mode of procedure lowers our opini=
on of the chronicler, it has obvious advantages for a modern investigator, =
as it enables him to see the nature of the now lost materials which were us=
ed by Tabar=C4=AB. Later writers like al-Mak=C4=ABn, Ab=C5=AB-l-Fid=C4=81, =
Ibn al-Ath=C4=ABr, found it very convenient to draw from the compilation of=
 Tabar=C4=AB, instead of dealing directly with the numerous sources from wh=
ich Tabar=C4=AB drew; just as later Greek chronographers used to work on su=
ch a compilation as that of George Monachus. Our gratitude to Tabar=C4=AB f=
or preserving lost material is seriously modified by the consideration that=
 it was largely to his work that the loss of that material in its original =
form is due. His work was so convenient and popular that the public ceased =
to want the older books and consequently they ceased to be multiplied.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_534">The Annals of Tabar=C4=AB were carried down to=
 his own time, into the tenth century, but his notices for the last seventy=
 years are very brief. The whole work has not yet been translated. We have =
already made the acquaintance of the part of it bearing on Persian history =
in the translation of N=C3=B6ldeke (1879). A portion of the history of the =
Saracen conquests has been edited and translated by Kosegarten (1831). For =
the history of the caliphate from 670 to 775, Weil had the original work of=
 Tabar=C4=AB before him (in MS.), in writing his Geschichte der Chalifen. A=

rities are omitted; the distinction of varying accounts often disappears; a=

 the nobility and the priests. It was =E2=80=9Ctranslated=E2=80=9D into Ara=
bic by Ibn Mukaffa in the eighth century; and his version, perhaps less rem=
ote from our idea of a translation than most Arabic works of the kind, was =
used by the Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria (see below). Tabar=C4=AB did =

 made it highly probable that they entered Upper Hungary from Galicia, thro=
ugh the passes of Dukla. His arguments are: (1) the Slavs of Dacia and the =
Lower Danube were independent until <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entit=
y ad">ad</span></span> 581-4, when they were reduced to submission by the A=
vars; (2) the assumption of an advance through Galicia will explain the red=
uction of the Dudleby, in Volhynia. The record of this event is preserved o=
nly in the Russian Chronicle of Nestor (so called) but there seems no reaso=
n not to accept it as a genuine tradition. The passage is as follows (c. 8,=
 ed. Miklosich, p. 6): =E2=80=94</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_554">=E2=80=9CThese Obrs made war on the Slavs, and=
 conquered the Duljebs, who are Slavs, and did violence to the Duljeb women=
. When an Obr wished to go anywhere, he did not harness a horse or an ox, b=
ut ordered three or four women to be harnessed to his carriage, to draw the=
 Obr; and so they vexed the Duljebs.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_555">The chronicler places this episode in the reig=
n of Heraclius. But Schafarik plausibly argues that it belongs to a much ea=
rlier period, before the invasion of Hungary.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_556">To these arguments I may add another. (3) The =
invasions of Austrasia almost demand more northerly headquarters for the Av=
ars, than Wallachia. Nor does the passage of Corippus contradict the assump=
tion that the Avar nation was settled in Galicia, or thereabouts, in <span =
class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 565. For the passag=
e need imply only that an armed contingent had accompanied the embassy, thr=
ough Moldavia, to the banks of the Danube, and pitched their tents there to=
 await the return of the envoys.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_557">On the whole therefore it seems probable that =
the Avars in their westward advance followed an inland route from the Dniep=
er to the Upper Bug (through the Government of Kiev, and Podolia), not comi=
ng into hostile contact with the Bulgarians who were between the Dnieper an=
d the Danube (in the Government of Cherson, in Bessarabia and Wallachia).</=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_558">In regard to the extent of the Avar Empire, af=

=94 (<span class=3D"ptr">P. 85</span>, <span class=3D"ptr">86</span>)</h2>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_576">The story of the friendly race for empire betw=
een Heraclius and Nicetas did not awaken the scepticism of Gibbon. It rests=
 on the authority of Nicephorus (p. 3, ed. de Boor) and Theophanes (<i>sub =
ann.</i> 6101, p. 297, ed. de Boor), who doubtless derived it from the same=
 source. On political grounds, the story seems improbable, but the geograph=
ical implications compel us to reject it as a legend. The story requires us=
 to believe that Nicetas, starting from Carthage at the same time as Heracl=
ius and marching overland, had the smallest chance of reaching Constantinop=
le before his competitor=E2=80=99s fleet.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_577">There can be no doubt, I think, that the eleva=
tion of Nicetas was not contemplated by the two fathers =E2=80=94 if it wer=
e not as an =E2=80=9Cunderstudy=E2=80=9D to Heraclius in case anything befe=
ll him. The part assigned to Nicetas in the enterprise was not to race Hera=
clius, but to occupy Egypt, and then to support Heraclius so far as was nec=
essary; and doubtless Nicetas started to perform his work before Heraclius =
put forth to sea. The possession of Egypt, the granary of the Empire, was o=
f the utmost importance for a pretender to the throne; and its occupation w=
as probably the first care of the African generals.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_578">In this connection it seems to me that a notic=
e of Sebaeos deserves attention. This historian states that =E2=80=9Cthe ge=
neral Heraclius revolted against Phocas, with his army, in the regions of A=
lexandria, and wresting Egypt from him reigned therein=E2=80=9D (c. 21, p. =
79-80 in Patkanian=E2=80=99s Russ. tr.); and the order of his narrative see=
ms to place this event considerably before the overthrow of Phocas. The sta=
tement of course is not strictly correct; Sebaeos himself probably did not =
distinguish the elder from the younger Heraclius; but the fact that Egypt <=
span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span=
><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>424<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span>=
 was occupied (by Nicetas) at the instance of the elder Heraclius, seems to=
 be preserved in this notice, uncontaminated by the legend of the race for =
the diadem.</p>

=80=94 (P. 177)</h2>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_599">The extant letter of Nicetius, Bishop of Tr=C3=
=A8ves, to Justinian, of which Gibbon translates a passage, has been genera=
lly explained as referring to the Aphthartodocetic heresy which the emperor=
 adopted shortly before the close of his reign. The meaning of the letter I=
 must leave to theologians; but, without venturing to intrude on subtleties=
 which, to adopt Gibbon=E2=80=99s phrase, must be retained in the memory ra=
ther than in the understanding, I may express my opinion that there is much=
 force in the view of Rev. W. H. Hutton, who argues in his Lectures on the =
Church in the Sixth Century (1897), that the letter does not seem to touch =
upon the incorruptibility of Christ=E2=80=99s body, but to be concerned wit=
h some other heresy.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_600">Mr. Hutton maintains a theory (which had been =
promulgated by Crackanthorpe at the beginning of the seventeenth century, a=
nd controverted by Hody towards the end of the same century), that Justinia=
n never fell into the Aphthartodocetic heresy. He is compelled to reject th=
e distinct evidence of contemporary writers (cp. above, p. 177, n. 101); an=
d he rests his case, which he has defended with great ability, on the high =
character for orthodoxy borne by Justinian and his theological learning, an=
d on the fact that his memory was not condemned by the Church. But the dire=
ct evidence is too strong, whatever opinion be held either of the sincerity=
 of Justinian in theological matters, or as to the psychological probabilit=
y of a theologian of seventy or eighty years of age lapsing into a christol=
ogical heresy. As the edict was never issued, the Church was not called on =

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_601">Many readers of the xlviiith chapter, having t=
ravelled over the long series of the later Emperors through a period of six=
 hundred years, may come away with a bewildered feeling of having seen much=
 and distinguished little, and with a conviction that it would require an a=
rduous effort of the memory to retain the succession of the princes and the=
 association of each with his own acts. The memory, however, will find the =
task considerably alleviated, when the whole period is divided into certain=
 lesser periods into which it naturally falls; and it might have been well =
if Gibbon had added to his lucid exposition of the plan of his own work (in=
 the introduction to this chapter) a brief survey of the six hundred years,=
 according to its divisions. These divisions roughly correspond to dynastie=
s.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_602">(1) Heraclian Dynasty. Seventh century. <span =
class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 610-717.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_603">In this period the Empire declines in power, a=
nd the boundaries retreat, through the encroachments of the Saracen and Sla=
vonic invaders. It ends with twenty years of anarchy (<span class=3D"sc"><s=
pan class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 695-717): Justinian II. being over=
thrown; followed by two tyrants; restored again to power; killed; and follo=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_605">This is the period of revival The territorial =
extent of the Empire is still further reduced, but, within its diminished b=
orders, between the Haemus and the Taurus, it is consolidated and renovated=
. This is mainly the work of the two great Emperors Leo III. and his son Co=
nstantine V. (717-775). On the principle of dynastic division, this period =
falls into three parts: =E2=80=94</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_606">(<i>a</i>) Syrian (commonly called Isaurian) D=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_609">But it may be more usefully divided into two p=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_610">(<i>a</i>) <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"e=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_611">The following Emperor (Nicephorus) is indiffer=
ent, and his successor (Michael I.) is an image-worshipper.</p>

rors (813-842); reaction against it, and restoration of images, under Theod=
ora and Michael III. (842-867). Thus the history of iconoclasm in the ninth=
 century is a replica of its history in the eighth; and observe that in bot=
h cases the reaction was carried out under a female sovereign.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_613">(3) Basilian, or Armenian (=E2=80=9CMacedonian=
=E2=80=9D), Dynasty. <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span>=
</span> 867-1057.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_614">This period is marked by a reaction against th=
e policy of the Iconoclasts (cp. Appendix 10), and by a remarkable territor=
ial expansion, rendered possible by the consolidation which had been the wo=
rk of the great Iconoclasts. We may conveniently distinguish three sub-peri=
ods: (<i>a</i>) <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></spa=
n> 867-959, marked by great legislative activity, and some attempts to reco=
ver lost provinces =E2=80=94 successful only in Italy; (<i>b</i>) <span cla=
ss=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 959-1025, marked by la=
rge acquisitions of long-lost territory, both in Asia and Europe; (<i>c</i>=
) <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 1025-1057, =
stationary.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_615">The succession of these three periods of decli=
ne, renovation, and expansion, is illustrated by an exact parallel in the s=
uccession of three corresponding but shorter periods, in the fifth and sixt=
h centuries. There we see the decline and territorial diminution of the Emp=
ire, in the reigns of Arcadius and Theodosius II., under the stress of the =
Gothic and Hunnic invasions; the renovation, with financial retrenchment, u=
nder Zeno and Anastasius; the brilliant territorial expansion, under Justin=
ian, rendered possible by the careful policy of his predecessors. It is als=
o remarkable that the third period in both cycles is marked by great legisl=
ative activity. Further, the last part of the Basilian period (<span class=
=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 1025-1057) corresponds t=
o the reigns of Justin II., Tiberius II., and Maurice.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_616">(4) Comnenian Dynasty. <span class=3D"sc"><spa=
n class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 1057-1204.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_617">At the very beginning of this period, the Empi=
re, undermined by centuries of a pernicious economic system and strained to=
 the utmost by the ambitious policy of the Basilian period, yields to the i=
nvasion of the Seljuk Turks and loses territory which it had never lost bef=
ore. A series of able, nay, brilliant, princes preserve the fabric for anot=
her century and a quarter; but, when it passes into the hands of the incapa=
ble Angeli, it collapses at the first touch (<span class=3D"sc"><span class=
=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 1204).</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_618">This period of decline, following on the perio=
d of expansion, corresponds to the earlier period of decline in the 7th cen=
tury, following on the expansion of the 6th. The Persian invasion under Pho=
cas and Heraclius corresponds to the Seljuk invasion under Romanus Diogenes=
; while Heraclius, Constans II., and Constantine IV. correspond to Alexius,=
 John, and Manuel: we have even a parallel to the wayward Justinian II. in =
the wayward Andronicus.</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_620">From the year <span class=3D"sc"><span class=
=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 726 to the year <span class=3D"sc"><span cl=
ass=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 774 there is a consistent inconsistency =
in the dates of the chronicle of Theophanes. The Anni Mundi and the Indicti=
ons do not correspond. Thus <span class=3D"sc">a.m.</span> 6220 is equated =
with Ind. 12; but while <span class=3D"sc">a.m.</span> 6220 answers to <spa=

ould answer to <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span=
> 728-9. It has been generally assumed that the Indications are right and t=
he Anni Mundi wrong; and the received chronology (of Baronius, Pagi, Gibbon=
, Lebeau, Muralt, Finlay, Hopf, &amp;c. &amp;c.) is based on this assumptio=
n. But it was pointed out (Bury, Later Roman Empire, ii. 425-7) that the an=
omaly was not due to an error of Theophanes (of the same kind as that which=
 he perpetrated in his annals of the preceding century, see above, Appendix=
 1), since a contemporary document (the Ecloga of Leo and Constantine) pres=
ents the same inconsistency; and that we must infer that the Anni Mundi are=
 right and the Indictions wrong. For, while the Anni Mundi represented a ch=
ronological system based on historical data, with which the government coul=
d not conceivably have tampered, the Indictions were part of a financial sy=
stem which might be manipulated by the Emperor. The conclusion was drawn (B=
ury, <i>ib.</i>) that Leo III. had packed two indictions into one year of t=
welve months, for the purpose of raising a double capitation tax; and that,=
 nearly fifty years later, Constantine V. spread one indiction over two yea=
rs of twelve months (<span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span>=
</span> 772-4), so restoring the correspondence between Anni Mundi and Indi=
ctions according to the previous method of computation. This reasoning was =
confirmed especially by one fact (Bury, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 426) =E2=80=94 t=
he eclipse of the sun noticed by Theophanes under <span class=3D"sc">a.m.</=
span> 6252, on Friday, Aug. 15, clearly the annular eclipse of <span class=
=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 760 on that day of the m=
onth and week. The received chronology would imply that the eclipse took pl=
ace in <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 761, A=
ug. 15; but astronomy assures us that there was no eclipse on that day, nor=
 was that day Friday.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_621">It follows that the dates of forty-seven years=
 in the 8th century (from 726-7 to 773-4) are a year wrong. Thus Leo III. d=
ied, not in 741, but in 740; the Iconoclastic Synod was held, not in 754, b=
ut in 753.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_622">These conclusions have been recently confirmed=
 and developed by M. H. Hubert (Chronologie de Th=C3=A9ophane, in Byz. Zeit=
schrift, vi. p. 491 <i>sqq.,</i> 1897), who has gone through the Papal acts=
 and letters of the period. He points out two important consequences of the=
 revised dating. While the Iconoclastic Council of Constantinople was sitti=
ng, there were deputies of the Pope in that city, =E2=80=94 though not nece=
ssarily as his representatives at the Council. More important still is the =
circumstance that the Council preceded the journey of Pope Stephen II. (in =
754) to the court of Pippin and the famous compact which he concluded with =
the Frank king at Quiersy. The Council would thus appear to be the event wh=
ich definitely decided the secession of Rome from the Empire.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_623">(The chronological question dealt with in this=
 Appendix has been since discussed by Mr. E. W. Brooks [in Byzantinische Ze=
itschrift, viii. p. 82 <i>sqq.,</i> 1899; The Chronology of Theophanes, 607=
-775], who arrives at the conclusion that Theophanes has used two different=
 schemes of chronology, and in the period under discussion dates sometimes =
by the one, sometimes by the other.)</p>

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_624">The general history of Byzantine law, from Jus=
tinian to the fall of the Empire, may be grouped under two epochs easily re=
membered: the attempt of the first Iconoclastic Emperors to legislate on ne=
w Christian principles, and the return to the Roman principles of the Justi=
nianean law by the first =E2=80=9CMacedonian=E2=80=9D sovereigns.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_625">A word must first be said of the substitution =
of the Greek for the Latin language in the domain of law. The great legal w=
orks of the Illyrian Justinian were composed in Latin, his native tongue. B=
ut the fact that to the greater part of the Empire ruled by him, and a stil=
l greater part of the Empire ruled by his successors, Latin was unintelligi=
ble, rendered a change of vehicle simply inevitable. The work of transforma=
tion began in his own reign. He issued most of his later laws (the Novels) =
in Greek, and in Novel 7 (15, ed. Zach.) expressly recognises the necessity=
 of using =E2=80=9Cthe common Greek tongue=E2=80=9D; Theophilus prepared a =
Greek paraphrase of the Institutes; and Dorotheus translated the Digest. Th=
e Code was also, immediately after its publication in Latin, issued (perhap=
s incompletely) in a Greek form.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/titl=

te-link type-footnote">1</a> After Justinian=E2=80=99s time the study of le=
gal texts in Latin seems, at Constantinople and in the Greek part of the Em=
pire, to have soon ceased altogether.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_626">In the troubles of the 7th century the study o=
f law, like many other things, declined; and in the practical administratio=
n of justice the prescriptions of the Code and Digest were often ignored, o=
r modified by the alien precepts of Christianity. The religion of the Empir=
e had exerted but very slight influence =E2=80=94 no fundamental influence,=
 we may say =E2=80=94 on the Justinianean law. Leo III., the founder of the=
 Syrian (vulgarly called Isaurian) dynasty, when he restored the Empire aft=
er a generation of anarchy, saw the necessity of legislation to meet the ch=
anged circumstances of the time. The settlements of foreigners =E2=80=94 Sl=
avs and Mardaites =E2=80=94 in the provinces of the Empire created an agrar=
ian question, which he dealt with in his Agrarian Code. The increase of Sla=
vonic and Saracenic piracy demanded increased securities for maritime trade=
, and this was dealt with in a Navigation Code. But it was not only for spe=
cial relations that Leo made laws; he legislated also, and in an entirely n=
ew way, for the general relations of life. He issued a law book (in <span c=
lass=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 740 in the name of h=
imself and his son Constantine), which changed and modified the Roman law, =
as it had been fixed by Justinian. This Ecloga, as it is called, may be des=
cribed as a Christian law book. It is a deliberate attempt to change the le=
gal system of the Empire by an application of Christian principles. Example=
s, to illustrate its tendency, will be given below.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_627">The horror, in which the Iconoclasts were held=
 on account of their heresy by the image-worshippers, cast discredit upon a=
ll their works. This feeling had something to do with the great reaction, w=
hich was inaugurated by Basil I., against their legal reforms. The Christia=
n Code of Leo prevailed in the empire for less than a century and a half; a=
nd then, under the auspices of Basil, the Roman law of Justininan was (part=
ially) restored. In legal activity the Basilian epoch faintly reflected the=
 epoch of Justinian itself. A handbook of extracts from the Institutes, Dig=
est, Code, and Novels was published in <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"en=
tity ad">ad</span></span> 879, entitled the Prochiron (or =E1=BD=80 =CF=80=

=CF=82), to diffuse a knowledge of the forgotten system. But the great achi=
evement of the Basilian epoch is the Basilica =E2=80=94 begun under Basil, =
completed under Leo VI. =E2=80=94 a huge collection of all the laws of the =
Empire, not only those still valid, but <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"d=

It seems that two commissions of experts were appointed to prepare the mate=
rial for this work. One of these commissions compiled the Prochiron by the =
way, and planned out the Basilica in sixty Books. The other commission also=
 prepared a handbook, called the Epanagoge, which was never actually publis=
hed (though a sketch of the work is extant), and planned out the Basilica i=
n forty Books. The Basilica, as actually published, are arranged in sixty B=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_628">The Basilian revival of Justinianean law was p=
ermanent; and it is oustide our purpose to follow the history further, exce=
pt to note the importance of the foundation of a school of law at Constanti=
nople in the 11th century by the Emperor Constantine IX. The law enacting t=
he institution of this school, under the direction of a salaried Nomophylax=
, is extant.<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/gibbon-the-history=

e">2</a> John Xiphilin (see above) was the first director. This foundation =
may have possibly had some influence on the institution of the school at Bo=
logna half a century later.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_629">To illustrate the spirit of the legislation of=
 Leo III., an attempt to reconcile the discrepancies between civil and cano=
nical law, we may glance at his enactments as to marriage, the <i>patria po=
testas,</i> and the guardianship of minors.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_630">In the law of Justinian marriage had by no mea=
ns the sacrosanct character which the Church assigned to it. Like all contr=
acts, it could easily be dissolved at the pleasure of the contractors, and =
concubinage was legally recognised. The Ecloga enacted that a concubinate s=
hould be regarded as a marriage, thus legally abolishing the relation; and =
in this matter the Macedonian Emperors maintained the principle of the Icon=
oclasts; Leo VI. expressly asserting (Nov. 89) that there is no half-way st=
ate between the married and the unmarried.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_631">Roman law had defined a number of hindrances t=
o the contraction of marriage. The tendency of the Church, which regarded m=
arriage as not an admirable thing in itself but only a concession to weakne=
ss, was to multiply hindrances. Justinian had forbidden marriages between C=
hristians and Jews; the Ecloga recognises only marriages of Christians (and=
 orthodox Christians are meant).<a href=3D"https://oll.libertyfund.org/titl=
e/gibbon-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-vol-8#lf02=
14-08_footnote_nt_690" id=3D"lf0214-08_footnote_nt_690_ref" class=3D"footno=
te-link type-footnote">3</a> But the chief obstacles lay in degrees of rela=
tionship. Justinian=E2=80=99s Code forbade marriage between blood relatives=
 in the direct line of ascent and descent, between brothers and sisters, an=
d between uncle and niece, nephew and aunt. The Trullan synod of 692 extend=
ed the prohibition to first cousins; the Ecloga went further and forbade th=
e marriage of second cousins (=CE=B4=CE=B9=CF=83=CE=B5=CE=BE=CE=AC=CE=B4=CE=
=B5=CE=BB=CF=95=CE=BF=CE=B9). These prohibitions were preserved by the Mace=
donian Emperors, and it was generally recognised that marriages within the =
6th degree were illegal. It was even regarded as a question whether marriag=
es in the 7th degree were permissible. They were forbidden by the Church in=
 the 11th century, and this decision was confirmed by the Emperor Manuel. A=
 similar progress in strictness can be traced in the case of relationships =
by adoption, by marriage, and by baptismal sponsorship.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_632">In Justinian=E2=80=99s law =E2=80=9Cconsent=E2=
=80=9D was enough for the legal contraction of a marriage, and further form=
s were necessary only so far as the dowry was concerned. But under the eccl=
esiastical influence need was felt of giving greater solemnity and publicit=
y to the marriage contract, and the Iconoclasts prescribed a written form o=
f contract to be filled up and signed by three witnesses, but permitted thi=
s to be dispensed with by very poor people, for whom it would be enough to =
obtain the blessing of the Church (=CE=B5=E1=BD=90=CE=BB=CE=BF=CE=B3=CE=AF=
=CE=B1) or join <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"decoration">Edition: curr=
ent; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>432<span class=3D"bracket=
">]</span></span> hands in the presence of friends. The legislation of the =
Macedonian Emperors maintained the spirit (though not the words) of the Ecl=
oga, in so far as it prescribed <i>public</i> marriages with penalties.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_633">And, if the Church made the contraction of mar=
riage more solemn, it made divorce more difficult. It was here that there w=
as the most striking opposition between the law of the Church and of the St=
ate, and here the tendency of the Iconoclastic legislation is most striking=
ly shown. The Church regards marriage as an indissoluble bond, and for a di=
vorced person to marry again is adultery. On the other hand, Roman law, as =
accepted and interpreted by Justinian, laid down that no bond between human=
 beings was indissoluble, and that separation of husband and wife was a pri=
vate act, requiring no judicial permission. And persons who had thus separa=
ted could marry again. The only concession that Justinian made in the direc=
tion of the ecclesiastical view was his ordinance that persons who separate=
d without a valid reason should be shut up in monasterics, =E2=80=94 a meas=
ure which effectually hindered them from contracting a new marriage. The sp=
irit of the Ecloga is apparent in its full acceptance of the ecclesiastical=
 doctrine in this point =E2=80=94 the indissolubility of marriage. Divorce =
is permitted only in four cases, and this as a concession to the weakness a=
nd wickedness of human nature. The Basilian legislation returned to the Jus=
tinianean doctrine, and the antinomy between the canon and the civil law su=
rvives to the present day in Greece.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_634">Another question arises when the dissolution o=
f marriage is due to the hand of death; is it lawful for the survivor to en=
ter again into the state of matrimony? More than once this question assumed=
 political significance in the course of Imperial history. The Church alway=
s looked upon the marriage of widowers or widows as reprehensible, founding=
 her doctrine on the well-known prescriptions of St. Paul, in 1 Corinthians=
, chap. vii. A second marriage might be tolerated, but a third was distinct=
ly unlawful, and a fourth =E2=80=94 swinishness (so Gregory Nazianzen; see =
Zachari=C3=A4, Gr.-rom. Recht, p. 82, note 200). The civil law recognised n=
o such restrictions, and only interfered so far as to protect the interests=
 of the children of the first marriage. But here the ecclesiastical view ga=
ined ground. The Ecloga affects not to consider a third marriage conceivabl=
e; the Empress Irene distinctly forbade a third marriage. Basil contented h=
imself with recognising the ecclesiastical penalties imposed on persons gui=
lty of a third marriage, but declared a fourth illegal. His son Leo committ=
ed this illegality (see above, p. 263); but after Leo=E2=80=99s death the =
=E2=80=9Cact of unity=E2=80=9D (=CF=84=CF=8C=CE=BC=CE=BF=CF=82 =CF=84=CE=B7=
=CC=82=CF=82 =E1=BC=90=CE=BD=CF=8E=CF=83=CE=B5=CF=89=CF=82) of the synod of=
 <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 920 confirme=
d the ordinance of Basil, with the additional restriction that a third marr=
iage of a person who had children and was over forty years of age was illeg=
al.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_635">The influence of the ecclesiastical view of ma=
rriage as a <i>consortium vitae</i> can be seen too in the treatment of the=
 property of the married partners. In the Justinianean law, the principle o=
f the elaborate prescriptions for the property of the wife and the husband,=
 for the <i>dos</i> and the <i>propter nuptias donatio,</i> is the independ=
ence and distinction of the property of each. The leading idea of the syste=
m developed in the Ecloga is the community of property in marriage, =E2=80=
=94 the equal right of each partner to the common stock, however great the =
disproportion may have been before the contributions of each. Basil returne=
d to the Justinianean system, but the doctrine of the Ecloga seems to have =
so firmly established itself in custom that Leo VI. found it necessary to m=
ake a compromise, and introduced a new system, which was a mixture of the I=
conoclastic and the Justinianean doctrines.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_636">The <i>patria potestas</i> still holds an impo=
rtant place in the Justinianean law, although the rights which it gave the =
father over the children were small indeed <span class=3D"pb"><span class=
=3D"decoration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</s=
pan>433<span class=3D"bracket">]</span></span> compared with the absolute c=
ontrol which he had enjoyed in ancient times. The tendency was to diminish =
these rights and to modify the stern conception of <i>patria potestas</i> b=
y substituting the conception of a natural guardianship; a change correspon=
ding to the change (promoted by Christianity) in the conception of the fami=
ly, as held together by the duties of affection rather than by legal obliga=
tions. The two most important points in the later transformation of the <i>=
patria potestas</i> were (1) its conversion into a parental <i>potestas,</i=
> the mother being recognised as having the same rights and duties as the f=
ather (thus her consent as well as the father=E2=80=99s is necessary for th=
e contraction of a marriage); and (2) the increased facilities for emancipa=
tion when the child came to years of discretion; emancipation seems to have=
 been effected by the act of setting up a separate establishment. These pri=
nciples were established by the Iconoclasts; but Basil revived the Justinia=
nean legislation. Here, however, as in many other cases, the letter of Basi=
l=E2=80=99s law books was not fully adopted in practice, and was modified b=
y a Novel of Leo VI. which restored partly the law of the Ecloga.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_637">In respect to the guardianship of minors the t=
endency in the later civil law had been to supersede the <i>tutela</i> by t=
he <i>cura</i> =E2=80=94 the <i>tutor</i> who was appointed in the interest=
s of the family by the <i>curator</i> appointed in the interests of the pub=
lic. The office of guardian came to be regarded as a public office for the =
good of the ward. Yet the old distinction of <i>cura</i> and <i>tutela</i> =
still subsisted in the Justinianean law books, though in use it was practic=
ally obsolete. The Ecloga logically developed this tendency; here <i>tutela=
</i> does not appear at all, only <i>cura</i> (=CE=BA=CE=BF=CF=85=CF=81=CE=
=B1=CF=84=CF=89=CF=81=CE=B5=CE=AF=CE=B1). And, as on the death of one paren=
t the children were under the care of the surviving parent, there was no qu=
estion of guardianship except in the case of orphans. The Ecloga provides =
=E2=80=94 and here we see the ecclesiastical influence =E2=80=94 that, when=
 the parents have not designated a guardian, the guardianship of orphans is=
 to devolve on ecclesiastical institutions (<i>e.g.</i> the =E1=BD=80=CF=81=
=CF=95=CE=B1=CE=BD=CE=BF=CF=84=CF=81=CE=BF=CF=95=CE=B5=C9=A9=CC=82=CE=BF=CE=
=BD at Constantinople), and to last until the wards marry or reach the age =
of twenty. Here again the Basilica returned to the Justinianean law.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_638">These examples will give some idea of the gene=
ral character of the development of Byzantine civil law. Two interesting po=
ints may be added in connection with the law of inheritance. Constantine VI=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_639">In criminal, as in civil law, the Iconoclastic=

 But, whereas in the case of the civil law the Basilian legislation was cha=

is retained in most cases, and sometimes developed further.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_640">The criminal law of the Ecloga is very remarka=
ble. It was intended to be, and professed to be, more humane than the old R=
oman law; but a modern reader is at first disposed to denounce it as horrib=
ly barbaric. Its distinguishing feature is the use of mutilation as a mode =
of punishment =E2=80=94 a penalty unknown in Roman law. The principle of mu=
tilation was founded on Holy Scripture (see St. Matthew, v. 29, 30: If thin=
e eye offend thee, &amp;c.). Since mutilation was generally ordained in cas=
es where the penalty had formerly been death, the law-givers could certainl=

does not make this exception; and, though the enactments of the Basilica fo=
llow Justinian, practice seems in the meantime to have secured for murderer=
s the right of asylum, which was definitely recognised by Constantine VII. =
A novel of this Emperor enacts that a murderer who takes refuge in a church=
 shall do penance according to the canon law, shall then be banished for li=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_660">In general we can see that the tendency of the=
 Ecloga was to avoid capital punishment so far as possible, and this tenden=
cy increased as time went on. Gibbon mentions the fact that under John Comn=
enus capital punishment was never inflicted (the authority is Nicetas); but=
 this must not be interpreted in the sense that the death penalty was forma=
lly abolished, but rather taken as a striking illustration of the tendency =
of the Byzantine spirit in that direction. We may question whether this ten=
dency was due so much to the growth of feelings of humanity as to ecclesias=
tical motives, namely the active maintenance of the asylum privileges of Ch=
ristian sanctuaries, and the doctrine of repentance. The mutilation punishm=
ents at least are discordant with our notions of humane legislation. Zachar=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_663">In order to comprehend the land question, whic=
h comes prominently before us in the 10th century, it is necessary to under=
stand the various ways in which land was held and the legal status of those=
 who cultivated it. The subject has been elucidated by Zachari=C3=A4 von Li=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_664">We have, in the first place, the simple distin=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_665">(1) The peasant proprietors (=CF=87=CF=89=CF=
=81=C9=A9=CC=82=CF=84=CE=B1=CE=B9) lived in village communities. The commun=
ity, as a whole, was taxed, each member paying his proportion, but the comm=
unity, and not the individual, being responsible to the state. To use techn=

=CE=BA=CE=B7=CE=BD=CF=83=CE=B1, and the proprietors are <i>consortes.</i> I=

=B8=CF=89=CF=84=CE=BF=CE=AF, <i>liberi coloni</i>), who cultivated their ho=
ldings at their own expense, paying a rent (whether in gold or kind) to the=
 proprietor. At the end of thirty years of such tenure, the tenant (and his=
 posterity) became bound to the land in perpetuity; he could not give up hi=
s farm, and on the other hand the proprietor could not eject him. But excep=

oil or serf-labourers. And these classes continued to exist till the latest=
 age of the Empire. If the Iconoclastic reformers had had their way, perhap=
s the history of the agricultural classes would have been widely different.=
 The abolition of the principle which the first Christian Emperor had adopt=
ed, of nailing men to the clod, was part of the programme which was carried=
 out by the Iconoclast Emperors and reversed by their successors.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_672">The storms of the 7th century, the invasions o=
f Slavs and Saracens, had made considerable changes in the condition of the=
 provincial lands. The Illyric peninsula had been in many parts occupied by=
 Slavonic settlers; in many cases the dispossessed provincials had fled to =
other parts of the Empire; and Emperors had transferred whole populations f=
rom one place to another, to replenish deserted districts. These changes re=
ndered a revision of the land laws imperative; and, when an able sovereign =
at length came to the throne, he set himself the task of regulating the con=
ditions of agriculture. The Agricultural Code (=CE=BD=CF=8C=CE=BC=CE=BF=CF=
=82 =CE=B3=CE=B5=CF=89=CF=81=CE=B3=CE=B9=CE=BA=CF=8C=CF=82) was issued eith=
er by Leo III. or by his son, who worked in the same spirit as the father; =
it consists chiefly of police provisions in regard to rural crimes and misd=
emeanours, but it presumes a state of things completely different from that=
 which existed in the 6th century and existed again in the 10th. In this Co=
de no man is nailed to the clod, and we hear nothing of serf-labourers (<i>=
adscriptitii</i>) or of services owed by freemen to landlords. We cannot as=
cribe this radical change, the abolition of what we may call serfdom, to an=
y other sovereign than the reformer Leo III.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_673">The Agricultural Code shows us peasant proprie=
tors in their village communities as before; but it shows us, too, =E2=80=

=80=94 communities which own the land in common, no member possessing a par=
ticular portion as his own.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_674">As for tenants =E2=80=94 now fully free, no lo=
nger bound to the soil, =E2=80=94 of these there are two classes, according=
 to the agreement made with the landlord. There are the tithe-rent tenants,=
 =CE=BC=CE=BF=CF=81=CF=84=C9=A9=CC=82=CF=84=CE=B1=CE=B9, and the <i>m=C3=A9=

=84=CE=B1=CE=AF. The =CE=BC=CE=BF=CF=81=CF=84=CE=AF=CF=84=CE=B7=CF=82 paid =
a tenth of the produce to the landlord, as rent for the land. The =E1=BC=A1=
=CE=BC=CE=B9=CF=83=CE=B5=CE=B9=CE=B1=CF=83=CF=84=CE=AE=CF=82 worked his far=
m at the landlord=E2=80=99s expense, and the produce was divided equally be=
tween landlord and tenant. (Thus the ground rent =3D 1/10 of the yearly yie=
ld; the interest on capital =3D 4/10; and the labour =3D 5/10.) The =CE=BC=
=CE=BF=CF=81=CF=84=CE=AF=CF=84=CE=B7=CF=82, then, corresponds to the =CE=BC=

atisfied with the ground rent of 1/10, fixed in the Agricultural Code; it w=
as insufficient, they said, to make the estate pay, when the taxation was a=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_676">The failure of the land reforms of Leo and Con=
stantine, and the reversion to the old system, close the history of the ten=
ants; but there still remains an important chapter in the history of the pe=
asant proprietors. In the 10th century we find the large estates growing st=
ill larger at the expense of the small proprietors whose lands they absorb,=
 and these small proprietors passing <span class=3D"pb"><span class=3D"deco=
ration">Edition: current; Page: </span><span class=3D"bracket">[</span>438<=

ants. This evil has been briefly touched upon in connection with Romanus I.=
 and Tzimisces; see above, p. 265, n. 46, and p. 273, n. 57. The decline of=
 the class of small farmers was due to two causes: the influence of the asc=
etic ideal and the defective economical conditions of the time.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_677">The attraction of monastic life induced many p=
roprietors to enter cloisters, and bestow their property on the communities=
 which admitted them, or, if they were rich enough, to found new monastical=
 or ecclesiastical institutions. The cultivation of the lands which thus pa=
ssed to the church was thereby transferred from peasant proprietors to tena=
nts.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_678">The want of a sound credit system, due to the =
ignorance of political economy, and the consequent depression of trade, ren=
dered land the only safe investment for capital; and the consequence of thi=
s was that landowners who possessed capital were always seeking to get more=
 land into their hands. Hence they took every occasion that presented itsel=
f to induce their poor neighbours, who lived from hand to mouth and had no =
savings, to pledge or sell their land in a moment of need. The farmer who t=
hus sold out would often become the tenant of the holding which had been hi=
s own property.</p>

aller folk, except in the case of relationship. It was also enacted that on=
ly after a possession of ten years could a property acquired in this way be=
come permanently the property of the magnate. But a few years later the mag=
nates had an unusually favourable opportunity and could not resist the temp=
tation of using it. There was a long succession of bad harvests and cold wi=
nters (<span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 927-93=
2), which produced great distress throughout the country. The small farmers=
, brought to penury, standing on the brink of starvation, had no resource b=
ut to purchase bread for themselves and their families by making over their=
 little farms to rich neighbours. For this was the only condition on which =
the magnates would give them credit. The distress of these years in the rei=
gn of Romanus formed an epoch in the history of peasant proprietorship. It =
was clear that the farmers who had pledged their land would have no chance =
of recovering themselves before the ten years, after which their land would=
 be irreclaimable, had expired. The prospect was that the small farmer woul=

consisted chiefly of large domains.</p>
<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_681">It must be remembered that, though the formati=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_682">In studying the Imperial land legislation and =
the relations of landlord and tenant in South-eastern Europe and Asia Minor=
, it is of essential importance for a modern student to bear in mind two fa=
cts which powerfully affected that development in a manner which is almost =
inconceivable to those who are familiar with the land questions in modern s=
tates. These facts =E2=80=94 both of which were due to the economical inexp=
erience of ancient and mediaeval Europe =E2=80=94 are: (1) the legislation =
was entirely based on fiscal considerations; the laws were directly aimed a=
t filling the treasury with as little inconvenience and trouble as possible=
 on the part of the state: the short-sighted policy of making the treasury =
full instead of making the Empire rich; (2) the lamentably defective credit=
-system of the Roman law, discouraging the investment of capital and render=
ing land almost the only safe speculation, reacted, as we have seen, in a p=
eculiar way on the land question. Something more is said of this economical=
 weakness in the later Empire in the following note.</p>

 we should have no external reasons to suspect copies dating from about 300=
 years later. But the omission of these letters in the Acts of the Nicene C=
ouncil, though they are stated to have been read at the Council, introduces=
 a shadow of suspicion. If they were preserved, how comes it that they were=
 not preserved in the Acts of the Council, like the letter of Gregory to th=
e Patriarch Germanus? There is no trace anywhere of the Latin originals.</p=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_695">Turning to the contents, we find enough to con=

 of Leo=E2=80=99s reign is placed in the 14th instead of the 15th indiction=
), and the false implication that the Imperial territory of the Ducatus Rom=
=C3=A6 terminated at twenty-four stadia, or three miles, from Rome, point t=
o an author who was neither a contemporary of Leo nor a resident in Rome. B=
ut the insolent tone of the letters is enough to condemn them. Gregory II. =
would never have addressed to his sovereign the crude abuse with which thes=
e documents teem. Another objection (which I have never seen noticed) is th=
at in the 1st Letter the famous image of Christ which was pulled down by Le=

<p id=3D"Gibbon_0214-08_702">The attitude of Gregory II. is misrepresented =
by Gibbon. Gregory, though he stoutly opposed Leo=E2=80=99s iconoclastic po=
licy, did not arm against the Empire; and the disaffection in Italy, which =
led to the elevation of tyrants under his pontificate, was not due to the i=

 was because there was no prospect of help from Constantinople that Gregory=
 III. appealed to Charles Martel in <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entit=
y ad">ad</span></span> 739 to protect the Duchy of Rome against Lombard att=
acks. But the final breach (not indeed intended at the time to be a final b=
reach) with the Empire did not come till fifteen years later. The exarchate=
 had fallen, and Rome was girt about by the Lombard power; but Pope Stephen=
 would hardly have decided to throw himself entirely into the hands of the =
Frank king if the Council of Constantinople in <span class=3D"sc"><span cla=
ss=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 753 had not set a seal on the iconoclasti=
c heresy. It was when the news of this Council reached Rome that the Pope w=
ent forth on his memorable visit to King Pippin. The revision of the chrono=
logy of the 8th century (see above, p. 429) places this visit in a new ligh=
t. But even now the Pope did not intend to sever Italy from the Empire; the=
 formal authority of the Emperor was still recognised. Pippin made over to =
the Church the lands which the Lombard king, Aistulf, was forced to surrend=
er, but this bestowal was designated as a <i>restitution</i> =E2=80=94 not =
to the Church, for the Church never possessed them, but to the Empire. This=
 of course was only the formal aspect. Practically the Pope was independent=
 of the Emperor; his position was guaranteed by the Franks.<a href=3D"https=

ppus, from whence the first edition (1581, apud Plantin) was printed, is no=
 longer visible. The last editor, Foggini of Rome, has inserted the conject=
ural emendation of <i>soldan;</i> but the proofs of Ducange (Joinville, Dis=
sert. xvi. p. 238-240) for the early use of this title among the Turks and =
Persians are weak or ambiguous. And I must incline to the authority of d=E2=
=80=99Herbelot (Biblioth=C3=A8que Orient. p. 825), who ascribes the word to=
 the Arabic and Chaldean tongues, and the date to the beginning of the xith=
 century, when it was bestowed by the caliph of Bagdad on Mahmud, prince of=
 Gazna and conqueror of India. [This judgment on Foggini=E2=80=99s conjectu=
re is sound, though <i>sultan</i> is read by Partsch, the latest editor. It=
 is doubtful whether the lines do refer to the Turks.]</p></div>

ted that the expression of Evagrius conceals an allusion to the administrat=
ive policy of Maurice, which he explains as follows (Hist. of Greece, i. p.=
 308): Maurice aimed at reform and decided that his first step should be =
=E2=80=9Cto render the army, long a licentious and turbulent check on the i=
mperial power, a well-disciplined and efficient instrument of his will; and=
 he hoped in this manner to repress the tyranny of the official aristocracy=
=E2=80=9D and strengthen the authority of the central government. =E2=80=9C=
In his struggle to obtain this result he was compelled to make use of the e=
xisting administration; and, consequently, he appears in the history of the=
 empire as the supporter and protector of a detested aristocracy, equally u=
npopular with the army and the people; while his ulterior plans for the imp=
rovement of the civil condition of his subjects were never fully made known=
, and perhaps never framed even by himself.=E2=80=9D]</p></div>

the vanity of the Greeks substituted that name instead of the more ignoble =

the time of Charlemagne (Eginhard, p. 75 [V. Car. 15]). [The change was pro=
bably the result of an administrative innovation in the second half of the =
seventh century (due presumably to the Emperor Constans II.). Calabria, Apu=

enticate this previous inquiry, which I have studied to circumscribe and co=
mpress? =E2=80=94 If I persist in supporting each fact or reflection by its=
 proper and special evidence, every line would demand a string of testimoni=
es, and every note would swell to a critical dissertation. But the numberle=
ss passages of antiquity which I have seen with my own eyes are compiled, d=
igested, and illustrated by <i>Petavius</i> and <i>Le Clerc,</i> by <i>Beau=
sobre</i> and <i>Mosheim.</i> I shall be content to fortify my narrative by=
 the names and characters of these respectable guides; and in the contempla=
tion of a minute or remote object I am not ashamed to borrow the aid of the=
 strongest glasses. 1. The <i>Dogmata Theologica</i> of Petavius are a work=
 of incredible labour and compass; the volumes which relate solely to the i=
ncarnation (two folios, vth and vith, of 837 pages) are divided into xvi. b=
ooks =E2=80=94 the first of history, the remainder of controversy and doctr=
ine. The Jesuit=E2=80=99s learning is copious and correct; his Latinity is =
pure, his method clear, his argument profound and well connected; but he is=
 the slave of the fathers, the scourge of heretics, the enemy of truth and =
candour, as often as <i>they</i> are inimical to the Catholic cause. 2. The=
 Arminian Le Clerc, who has composed in a quarto volume (Amsterdam, 1716) t=
he ecclesiastical history of the two first centuries, was free both in his =
temper and situation; his sense is clear, but his thoughts are narrow; he r=
educes the reason or folly of ages to the standard of his private judgment,=
 and his impartiality is sometimes quickened, and sometimes tainted, by his=
 opposition to the fathers. See the heretics (Corinthians, lxxx.; Ebionites=
, ciii.; Carpocratians, cxx.; Valentinians, cxxi.; Basilidians, cxxiii.; Ma=
rcionites, cxli., &amp;c.) under their proper dates. 3. The Histoire Critiq=
ue du Manich=C3=A9isme (Amsterdam, 1734, 1739, in two vols. in 4to, with a =
posthumous dissertation sur les Nazar=C3=A8nes, Lausanne, 1745) of M. de Be=
ausobre is a treasure of ancient philosophy and theology. The learned histo=
rian spins with incomparable art the systematic thread of opinion, and tran=
sforms himself by turns into the person of a saint, a sage, or an heretic. =
Yet his refinement is sometimes excessive; he betrays an amiable partiality=
 in favour of the weaker side; and, while he guards against calumny, he doe=
s not allow sufficient scope for superstition and fanaticism. A copious tab=
le of contents will direct the reader to any point that he wishes to examin=
e. 4. Less profound than Petavius, less independent than Le Clerc, less ing=
enious than Beausobre, the historian Mosheim is full, rational, correct, an=
d moderate. In his learned work, De Rebus Christianis ante Constantinum (He=
lmstadt, 1753, in 4to), see the <i>Nazarenes</i> and <i>Ebionites,</i> p. 1=
72-179, 328-332; the Gnostics in general, p. 179, &amp;c.; <i>Cerinthus,</i=
> p. 196-202; Basilides, p. 352-361; Carpocrates, p. 363-367; Valentinus, p=

distinguish the older Latin translation from Montfaucon=E2=80=99s text and =
translation of the Vita Stephani. In his valuable article, Kaiser Leons III=
. Walten im Innern (Byz. Ztsch., v. p. 291), K. Schenk defends the view tha=
t Leo=E2=80=99s first edict ordered the pictures to be hung higher. He cite=
s the life of Stephanus without giving any reference except =E2=80=9CBaroni=
us ad annum, 726,=E2=80=9D and does not distinguish between Montfaucon=E2=
=80=99s edition and the older Latin version. Until the source of that old L=
atin version has been cleared up and its authority examined, it seems dange=
rous to accept a statement which depends on it alone. Schenk meets the argu=
ment that the mild character of the edict is inconsistent with the destruct=
ion of the picture by rejecting the latter fact. But his objections concern=
 the account of the destruction of the picture in the 1st Letter of Gregory=
 to Leo and do not touch the account in Theophanes; so that their only effe=
ct is to reinforce the arguments against the genuineness of the Pope=E2=80=
=99s letter.</p></div>

=9CJanuary 7th, Tuesday,=E2=80=9D and the date of the appointment of Anasta=
sius as =E2=80=9CJan. 22.=E2=80=9D (1) According to the vulgar chronology, =
which refers these dates to <span class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad=
</span></span> 730, the day of the week is inconsistent with the day of the=
 month. January 7 fell on Saturday. (2) According to the revised chronology=
 there is equally an inconsistency, for January 7 fell on Friday. (3) Neith=
er date could be reconciled with the length of the pontificate of Germanus =
as given by Theophanes (14 years 5 months 7 days, <i>loc. cit.;</i> Germanu=
s was appointed on August 11, 715). Now if Germanus was deposed on January =
17, 730, everything can be explained. That day was Tuesday; and January 22,=
 on which Anastasius was installed, was the Sunday following. (Sunday was a=
 favourite day for such installations.) The years, days, and months of the =
pontificate work out accurately. The emendation in the text of Theophanes i=
s very slight =E2=80=94 =CE=B9=CE=B6=E2=80=B2 for =CE=B6=E2=80=B2. This hig=
hly plausible solution is due to Hefele. The difficulty lies in the year; f=
or Theophanes assigns the events to the thirteenth indiction; whereas if <s=
pan class=3D"sc"><span class=3D"entity ad">ad</span></span> 730 was the yea=
r he should have assigned it to the fourteenth indiction, according to his =
own reckoning (see above, p. 429). But notwithstanding this, I believe that=
 Hefele=E2=80=99s correction is right, and that Germanus was deposed in <sp=
