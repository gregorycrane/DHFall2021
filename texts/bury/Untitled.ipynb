      "This instrument was indeed much inferior to our modern fire-arms; since it was exhausted by a single discharge, at the distance of only <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> paces.\n",

(15) <PERSON>Decebalus</PERSON>, the <NORP>Dacian</NORP> king, approved himself a rival not unworthy of <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON>; nor did he despair of his own and the public fortune, till, by the confession of his enemies, he had exhausted every resource both of valour and policy.\n",
      "To the <NORP>Romans</NORP> the ocean remained an object of terror rather than of curiosity; (<CARDINAL>66</CARDINAL>) the whole extent of the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC>, after the destruction of <GPE>Carthage</GPE>, and the extirpation of the pirates, was included within their provinces.\n",

      "We may computes however, that the legion, which was itself a body of six thousand eight hundred and thirty one <NORP>Romans</NORP>, might, with its attendant auxiliaries amount to <CARDINAL>about twelve thousand five hundred</CARDINAL> men.\n",
      "We may remark, that when <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> divided <GPE>Italy</GPE> into <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> regions, the little province of <GPE>Istria</GPE> was annexed to that seat of <NORP>Roman</NORP> sovereignty. (<CARDINAL>77</CARDINAL>)\n",

      "When <GPE>Syria</GPE> became subject to the <NORP>Romans</NORP>, it formed the eastern frontier of their empire; nor did that province, in its utmost latitude, know any other bounds than the mountains of <GPE>Cappadocia</GPE> to the north, and towards the south the confines of <GPE>Egypt</GPE>, and the Red Sea.\n",
      "When we reflect on the fame of <GPE>Thebes</GPE> and <LOC>Argos</LOC>, of <GPE>Sparta</GPE> and <GPE>Athens</GPE>, we can scarcely persuade ourselves that so many immortal republics of ancient <GPE>Greece</GPE> were lost in a single province of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, which, from the superior influence of the <NORP>Achaean</NORP> league, was usually denominated the province of <GPE>Achaia</GPE>.\n",
